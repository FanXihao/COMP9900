ABE,"Atlantia SpA (ATL.MI) has decided to exercise a call option to buy some or all of Abertis Infraestructuras SA's (ABE.MC) stake in Cellnex Telecom SA (CLNX.MC) for between 21.20 and EUR21.50 euros ($26.20-$26.60) per share, Atlantia said late Friday. The option is part of an agreement between the Italian company and Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA (ACS.MC) to buy Spanish toll-road operator Abertis. The Italian company can buy 29.9% or 34% of Cellnex, which operates infrastructure for wireless telecommunications. Atlantia said it will disclose how much it opts to buy within 10 days of the completion of the takeover offer for Abertis submitted through ACS's German subsidiary Hochtief AG (HOT.XE). ""Hochtief will take all the necessary actions so that, subject to the positive outcome of the rival public tender offer on Abertis's shares, Abertis will finalize the sale of Cellnex shares to Atlantia or to a company designated by it,"" Atlantia said in a statement. Atlantia also said that its main shareholder, the holding company Edizione Srl, has granted Atlantia an option to sell a 29.9% stake in Cellnex for EUR21.50 per share--with dividend--valued at EUR1.49 billion. The option may be exercised by April 16. Should the sale be completed, Edizione will give Atlantia the right to coinvest in Cellnex by buying up to roughly 6% of Cellnex within two years of the sale. Atlantia will also have ""a 'right of first offer' and a 'pre-emptive right' in the event that Edizione should decide to sell--directly or indirectly--part or all of the investment within 7 years of execution of the sale,"" Atlantia said.

ABE,"The boards of Atlantia SpA (ATL.MI), Hochtief AG (HOT.XE) and Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA (ACS.MC) have approved a joint bid for Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE.MC), marking the end of a prolonged and politically charged bidding war for the Spanish highway operator. The companies said in separate statements that the agreement was struck at meetings held late Wednesday, following months of rivalry between Atlantia and ACS that had driven up Abertis's share price by more than 20% since last May. Under the agreement ACS said it will modify its existing cash-and-share offer, submitted through German subsidiary Hochtief AG (HOT.XE), to remove the share component and keep the cash price at its original level of 18.36 euros ($22.69) a share. Atlantia will withdraw its original bid. If the bid is successful, ACS, Hochtief and Atlantia will create a joint holding company, injecting EUR7 billion in capital to purchase all of Hochtief's shares in Abertis. Atlantia will be the holding company's main shareholder, with slightly more than 50% of the shares, while ACS will hold 30% and Hochtief will take a stake of a bit less than 20%. As the largest shareholder, Atlantia will consolidate both the holding and Abertis in its books. The companies' relationship within the holding will be governed by a shareholder agreement to be decided at a later date, ACS said. Further complicating the transaction, Atlantia will invest up to EUR2.5 billion in Hochtief, taking slightly less than 25% of the shares in the German builder and indirectly increasing its stake in Abertis. In addition, Atlantia has until March 23 to exercise an option to buy Abertis's 34% stake in Cellnex Telecom SA (CLNX.MC) for between EUR21.20 and EUR21.50 a share, the company said.

ABE,"MADRID--Abertis Infraestructuras SA (ABE.MC) has committed to 4 billion euros ($4.93 billion) of investments between 2018 and 2020, Chief Executive Jose Aljaro Navarro said Tuesday, speaking before a meeting where shareholders will vote on a stake sale that could facilitate the company's potential takeover. The investment excludes any operations that would lead to non-organic growth, and most of it is earmarked for Brazil, followed by Chile and France, Mr. Navarro said at a press conference. A smaller portion of the investment will be spent on extending the life of existing concessions in Italy and India, he said. Abertis's board will seek shareholder authorization for a divestiture of its stake in satellite operator Hispasat SA at Tuesday's meeting. The stake has been a stumbling block in the bidding war between Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA (ACS.MC) and Atlantia SpA (ATL.MI) over Abertis, as Spain's government considers the company to be strategic national infrastructure, which means it is subject to separate regulatory review. On Monday, Spain's market regulator CNMV said it approved Hochtief AG (HOT.XE)'s bid for Abertis. Hochtief parent company ACS and Atlantia have previously said they may table a joint takeover offer, and it is unclear if they will let the Hochtief bid stand.

Atlantia's bid, which values Abertis at 16.3 billion euros ($20.26 billion), received approval from the Spanish market regulator, the CNMV, in October. However, the Spanish ministry of public works and ministry of energy later said that Atlantia was legally obliged to seek their approval separately, and that the CNMV shouldn't have approved the deal without its prior consent. The government has reportedly been pressuring Abertis shareholders to accept a rival EUR18.6 billion bid from Germany's Hochtief AG (HOT.XE), which is owned by Spanish construction company Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA (ACS.MC).

The ministries said that Atlantia was legally obliged to seek their authorization to take control over Abertis, as the company operates the majority of the country's toll roads, and requested that Atlantia now asks for government authorization to proceed with its bid. Abertis also owns a majority stake in satellite company Hispasat SA, which the government views as a strategically-important national asset.

The German construction company, which is controlled by Spain's Actividades de Construccion y Servicios SA (ACS.MC), has offered Abertis shareholders the option of cash and new shares. Existing Abertis shareholders can take a cash payout of EUR18.76 per share, or 0.1281 of a new share in Hochtief, or a combination of the two. The offer rivals a EUR16.50 per share bid submitted by Italian highway operator Atlantia in May. Atlantia's bid received approval from the Spanish market regulator and the European Commission earlier this month. Abertis shares were trading at EUR17.70 until they were suspended by the Spanish market regulator this afternoon. Abertis shares resumed trading at 1400 GMT. The Hochtief offer is backed by a consortium of international banks led by JPMorgan Chase & Co.(JPM). With a market capitalization of EUR9.49 billion, Hochtief is considerably smaller than Abertis, which has a market capitalization of EUR16.88 billion, and far smaller than Atlantia, which is valued at EUR22.49 billion. Last week British activist hedge fund TCI Fund Management increased its stake in Abertis to around 2.7% and said it strongly supports Atlantia's bid. Spanish conglomerate Grupo Villar Mir SAU, which owns around 1.7% of Abertis, has also backed Atlantia's bid. However, several Spanish media outlets have reported that Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy is reluctant to let Abertis fall out of Spanish control and favors a local buyer.

ABE,"PHILADELPHIA, March 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Aberdeen Emerging Markets Smaller Company Opportunities Fund, Inc. (nyse american:ABE) (the ""Fund"") announced that shareholders of the Fund voted to approve an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the ""Plan"") between the Fund and Aberdeen Chile Fund, Inc. (the ""Acquiring Fund"") at its special meeting of shareholders (the ""Special Meeting"") held today, March 16, 2018. The purpose of the Special Meeting was to seek shareholder approval of the Plan in connection with the consolidation of up to eight closed-end funds, including the Fund, into a single closed-end fund (the ""Combined Fund"") with a multi-cap emerging markets equity income investment strategy (the ""Reorganizations""). The consolidation would achieve certain economies of scale and other operational efficiencies. With regard to the Reorganization of the Fund, it is currently expected that the closing date will be prior to the end of April 2018; however, the closing date is subject to change if shareholder approvals of the Reorganizations of other target funds are delayed. If the Reorganization closes, the global emerging markets equity (GEM) investment team of the Fund's adviser and its affiliates would continue to be responsible for the day-to-day management of the Combined Fund following the consolidation.  The GEM team has been investing in emerging market equities since the 1980s and has experience over many years managing listed closed-end funds with income or total return as an investment objective.  The GEM team works in a collaborative fashion, with all team members having both portfolio management and research responsibilities.  Devan Kaloo and Joanne Irvine will continue to lead the team that is jointly and primarily responsible for managing the Combined Fund following the consolidation.  The joint proxy statement/prospectus for the Special Meeting included further details about the portfolio management team and is available on the Fund's website (aberdeenabe.com). The Combined Fund would follow a multi-cap emerging markets equity income investment strategy that utilizes leverage.  The Combined Fund would seek to provide both current income and long-term capital appreciation by investing, under normal market conditions, at least 80% of its net assets, plus any borrowings for investment purposes, in emerging market equity securities. Additionally, it is anticipated that the Combined Fund would begin using leverage for investment purposes through borrowing in an amount currently estimated to be approximately 10% of total assets. The countries in which the GEM team currently expects to invest approximately 10% or more of the Combined Fund's assets are Brazil, China and India, and 5% or more in Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, Taiwan and Thailand. The sectors in which the GEM team currently expects to invest approximately 10% or more of the Combined Fund's assets are Consumer Staples, Financials, IT and Telecom Service, and approximately 5% or more in Materials, Industrials, Consumer Discretionary and Real Estate. The GEM team's expectations with respect to the percentages of leverage, country allocation and sector allocation are based on current market conditions and could vary significantly under market conditions following the Reorganizations. As explained more fully in the proxy statement, now that the requisite shareholder approval of the Reorganization has been obtained, the Fund will sell securities and invest in a manner that differs from its current investment objective and strategies in anticipation of the Reorganization. As of the record date for the Special Meeting, December 18, 2017, there were 9,484,813 outstanding shares of the Fund.  79.15% of the outstanding shares were present at the Special Meeting, representing a quorum. The description of the Special Meeting proposal, the percentage of shareholders' votes cast for and against the Special Meeting proposal and number of shares voted at the Special Meeting are as follows:   Proposal Percentage of Votes Cast For Number of Votes Cast For Percentage of Votes Cast Against Number of Votes Cast Against Number of Votes Abstained To approve an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization 80.48% 6,042,107 19.37% 1,454,298 10,955   The Special Meeting proposal received the requisite shareholder vote at the Special Meeting. Additional Information Regarding Tender Offer in Connection with Fund ConsolidationFollowing the consolidation, the Combined Fund will commence a tender offer for its shares. It is expected that assets distributed in the tender offer, together with net realized capital gains, will aggregate up to a maximum distribution of 50%, and not less than 40%, of the net assets of the Combined Fund post- consolidation. Barring exceptional or unforeseen circumstances, the Combined Fund anticipates announcing the amount of the tender offer and an estimate of the special capital gains distribution within approximately 10 business days after the closing of the consolidation, both of which are expected to be completed and paid within approximately 60 days following the closing of the consolidation.  At the end of the Combined Fund's taxable year, any net capital gains realized from the portfolio realignment, tender offer and routine trading that have not previously been distributed would be distributed to shareholders at year end. Important InformationThe information in this press release is for informational purposes only and shall not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any securities or the solicitation of any vote or approval in any jurisdiction pursuant to or in connection with the proposed transaction or otherwise, nor shall there be any sale, issuance or transfer of securities in any jurisdiction in contravention of applicable law. No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

ABE,"LOS ANGELES, November 1, 2017 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- LOS ANGELES, November 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- While the stock market continues to boom, gold is holding its own and looks like it may make things even strong for U.S. mining companies. That is if the new Central Bank chair appointed by President Trump keeps interest rates low. The low interest rate would bode well for gold and means miners could prosper in the coming year. Emerging companies with gold resources in play include Pershing Gold PGLC, +1.49% Corvus Gold CORVF, +4.19% (KOR), Otis Gold OGLDF, +3.68% (OOO), and Bullfrog Gold Corp. BFGC, -0.88% A report from Bloomberg said President Donald Trump is leaning toward appointing Fed Gov. Jerome Powell to be the next chairman of the central bank. Analysts believe that would be positive for gold as he is in the dovish camp, in favor maintaining low interest rates. Trump is expected to announce his choice before starting a trip to Asia on Nov. 3. Major gold producers enjoyed a rally this year, alongside smaller companies who have gold resources under development. Likely the most undervalued is Bullfrog Gold Corp. (OTC: BFGC), which is perfectly positioned to take advantage of market strength. Bullfrog Gold has one of the best gold projects (based on price per ounce) in Nevada. It's in what is now being seen as a new Carlin Gold trend in the area Bullfrog gained from a former Barrick operation. Miners with strong gold in ground economics and who are also poised to benefit include Pershing Gold PGLC, +1.49% Corvus Gold (otcqx:CORVF)(KOR), and Otis Gold OGLDF, +3.68% (tsx.v:OOO), all which are working on the trend in Nevada. NEVADA GOLD A GOOD BET  Nevada is still at the heart of the gold mining sector in the US. During 2015 Nevada production accounted for just shy of 78% of America's total production. That also contributed to the U.S. ranking as fourth leading gold producer in the world. Nevada's 2015 production totaled 166 metric tons of gold. In all, the industry that is responsible for production added some $4.6 billion to U.S. GDP. It makes sense that companies looking to fortify their gold resources in the U.S., are looking in Nevada. Faults located in Nevada such as the famous Carlin Trend and neighboring Cortez Trend have produced dozens of massive gold deposits of more than 10 million ounces. So when word gets out of a possible new Carlin style trend, gold miners and investors take note. With this in mind, Nevada gold producers and exploration miners are moving with all speed to advance the projects in the region. THE TREND: CARLIN STYLE  Most recently, a new trend has been emerging in the area Nevada are where Bullfrog Gold, Corvus and several others have been developing gold projects. In October, Corvus released news from its drill results that are SE of Bullfrog Gold's property - reporting 2.69 g/t gold over 37.2 meters, including 11 meters at 5.78 g/t, and the discovery of a new Lower Zone with 25.6 meters at 2.17 g/t gold. According to the release, Corvus' drilling on its Mother Lode property has outlined two stacked, higher-grade zones within its deposit: an Upper Zone, hosted in intrusive and Tertiary sediments which is the primary initial target along the Mother Lode structural zone, and a newly discovered Lower Zone. Corvus says that the new Lower Zone discovery has ""alteration and textures analogous to structurally controlled deposits that occur more commonly in the Carlin and Battle Mountain - Eureka trends of north central Nevada.."" Gold miners take that to mean that this is a new Carlin Gold trend. BULLFROG GOLD UNDERVALUED  If gold continues its strong play into the coming season, undervalued producers like Bullfrog Gold Corp. could prove to have exceptional value, especially with discoveries of new trends. The company's flagship property, the Bullfrog Gold Project, is located 120 miles to the NW of Las Vegas, Nevada, and includes an ex-Barrick pit that recovered 2,300,000 ounces, along with the northern third of the Bullfrog deposit. It is also SW of the Corvus Gold Motherlode project and appears to be on trend with another miner announcing similar new gold discoveries, Northern Empire. The Bullfrog Gold Project produced gold up until Barrick Gold ABE, +1.88% (ABE) terminated production in early 1999. Since project economics were different then, with gold prices at an average less than $290 per ounce, it didn't make sense. But mining sector advances have improved the economics of this play and for Bullfrog gold, with the infrastructure already in place, the project holds tremendous value. In the acquisition, Bullfrog managed to acquire mounds of data that came with the property, mostly from Barrick's vaults. Bullfrog Gold has announced estimates in its 43-101 report in June of 525,000 ounces averaging 1.02 g/t using a gold price of $1200/oz and a base case cutoff grade of 0.36 g/t. Inferred resources were estimated at 120,000 ounces of gold averaging 1.20 g/t. Now that the likes of Corvus Gold and others on the same trend have released findings on what appears to be a new Carlin style gold trend, valuations could rise quickly. Bullfrog Gold is moving to advance its project, bringing it to the producing stage while the strong economics for gold continue. The market will have to determine some direction on gold based on the strength of the new Central Bank chair, interest rates and the view of political stability, especially if Trump's tax cuts take effect. In the meantime, gold is certainly holding its place and the U.S gold miners, like those in Nevada, should get a boost from new resources and production alike. POTENTIAL COMPARABLES  Pershing Gold PGLC, +1.49% Pershing Gold is an emerging Nevada gold producer on a fast-track to re-open the Relief Canyon Mine, which includes three open-pit mines and a state-of-the-art, fully permitted and constructed heap-leach processing facility. Pershing Gold is currently permitted to resume mining at Relief Canyon under the existing Plan of Operations. Corvus Gold (otcqx:CORVF)(KOR) Corvus Gold Inc. is a North American gold exploration and development company, focused on its near-term gold-silver mining project at the 100% owned Nevada, North Bullfrog project. In addition the Company controls a number of royalties on other North American exploration properties representing a spectrum of gold, silver and copper projects. Corvus is committed to building shareholder value through new discoveries and the expansion of those discoveries to maximize share price leverage in a recovering gold and silver market. Otis Gold OGLDF, +3.68% (tsx.v:OOO) Otis Gold has a resource estimate of 520,000 ounces on its Kilgore Project. The company is currently valued at $42.17 million, leaving their gold with a valuation of $81.10/oz of gold.

ABE,"PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 31, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of The Asia Tigers Fund, Inc. GRR, +0.55% (the ""Fund""), a closed-end investment company advised by Aberdeen Asset Management Asia Limited announces that it has approved a consolidation of the Fund into Aberdeen Chile Fund, Inc. (the ""Acquiring Fund""), subject to stockholder approval. The Board of Directors of the Acquiring Fund has approved various changes needed to implement a global emerging markets income strategy, as described below. The Asia Tigers Fund, Inc. joins six other funds listed below, each of which is a closed-end investment company advised by one or more affiliates of Aberdeen Asset Management Inc. (each an ""Acquired Fund"", and collectively, the ""Acquired Funds"") that will consolidate with the Acquiring Fund. Each Acquired Fund's consolidation with the Acquiring Fund is subject to the receipt of necessary stockholder approvals by such Fund. Other Acquired Funds: Aberdeen Emerging Markets Smaller Company Opportunities Fund, Inc. (nyse american:ABE) Aberdeen Latin America Equity Fund, Inc. (nyse american:LAQ) Aberdeen Israel Fund, Inc. (nyse american:ISL) Aberdeen Indonesia Fund, Inc. (nyse american:IF) Aberdeen Singapore Fund, Inc. SGF, +2.47%   Aberdeen Greater China Fund, Inc. GCH, +3.22% The consolidation is also subject to approval by the stockholders of the Acquiring Fund of the matters noted below. The Board of Directors of the Acquiring Fund previously announced that it had approved the consolidation of each Acquired Fund into the Acquiring Fund as well as changes to the Acquiring Fund's name, ticker symbol, investment objective and certain investment policies, subject to stockholder approval and effective upon the closing of a consolidation with one or more Acquired Funds (the ""Effective Date""). As a result of the proposed changes, as of the Effective Date, the Acquiring Fund will be renamed Aberdeen Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund, Inc. (the ""Combined Fund"") and will invest in emerging market equity securities in order to seek total return, consisting of a combination of capital appreciation and income. The Combined Fund may also use leverage to achieve its objective. It is anticipated that the Combined Fund's benchmark would be the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. The Combined Fund would trade on the NYSE American (formerly, NYSE MKT) under a new ticker symbol, expected to be AEF. The Combined Fund's strategy will seek to capitalize on Aberdeen's global emerging market equity capability by investing in a global portfolio of emerging market securities. The proposed consolidation aims to result in a combined fund materially larger in size than any of the Acquired Funds, which may help to provide improved liquidity of shares, a lower overall expense ratio and improved market awareness including research coverage. The advisers to the Fund and the Acquiring Fund currently anticipate that higher distributable income will be generated by the Combined Fund compared to the Fund.  There is no assurance that the consolidation will achieve any of these results. Prior to the consolidation, the Fund may be required to make a capital gains distribution. Following the consolidation, it is anticipated that the Board of Directors of the Combined Fund (the ""Combined Fund's Board"") will consider the approval of a tender offer at 99% of NAV. The tender offer size, in combination with capital gains to be distributed in accordance with the U.S. tax code, will be up to a maximum distribution of 50%, and not less than 40%, of the net assets of the Combined Fund. The price, size and terms of the offer will be determined by the Combined Fund's Board at a later date.  The Combined Fund's Board will also establish a targeted discount policy, which would include taking actions to be implemented if the Combined Fund trades at a significant discount to net asset value over a sustained period following the consolidation. The investment adviser to the Fund and the Board of Directors of the Fund believe that the proposed consolidation is in the best interests of the stockholders of the Fund. Additional information regarding the consolidation and the Combined Fund will be presented in a prospectus/proxy statement sent to the Fund's stockholders and a proxy statement sent to the Acquiring Fund's stockholders. Acquiring Fund stockholders will be asked to vote on changes to the Acquiring Fund's investment policies and other matters to restructure the Acquiring Fund into a fund with an emerging markets equity income strategy to facilitate the proposed consolidation at a special meeting targeted for the first quarter of 2018. Acquiring Fund stockholders will be asked to approve the issuance of additional shares in connection with the consolidation. Stockholders of the Fund and each other Acquired Fund will be asked to vote on the consolidation of their fund into the Acquiring Fund at a special meeting currently targeted for early-second quarter 2018.

ABE,"LOS ANGELES, October 24, 2017 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- LOS ANGELES, October 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Fueled by fear of military action by North Korea and a ratcheting up of rhetoric by Kim Jong-Un, gold traders have set their sights on gold reaching $1400 per ounce by the end of the year. The new price target also sent investors looking for top gold values and ways to find harbor in what they feel could be a rising storm. The immediate effect on the value of gold miners makes them a go-to group in this unsettled climate including Barrick Gold Corporation ABX, +0.48% (ABX), Randgold Resources GOLD, +1.12% Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, +1.57% and Bullfrog Gold Corp. BFGC, -0.88% Commenting on current market forces, Mark O'Byrne research director at GoldCore in Dublin said that, ""the backdrop for gold today is as bullish as it has been in a long time,"" adding that he expects gold to reach $1,400 an ounce before the end of the year. This could put gold on track for its best performance since 2010. Major mining companies who would benefit from the strong gold economics include Barrick Gold Corporation ABX, +0.48% , Randgold Resources GOLD, +1.12% and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, +1.57% all of whom are larger, established gold mining companies. Along with these, select junior mining firms such Bullfrog Gold Corp. (OTC: BFGC), are well positioned to take advantage of a buoyant gold market. Bullfrog Gold is developing a former Barrick operation in Nevada with existing gold in a very favorable mining region. Based on the current mix of fear and greed that is impacting gold, investors are likely to play all sides of this gold market. ARE GOLD STOCKS CHEAP?  Gold looks cheap compared to the stock markets that are highly overbought at the moment, according to reports by Rediff Business. Their report shows gold prices have outperformed the markets - S&P 500 - thus far in this century (since 2000), returning 86 per cent more than the market if both asset classes were indexed at 100 levels starting December 31, 1999, suggests the latest World Gold Council's Gold Investor report for September 2017. Over the past 17 years, the S&P 500 has undergone two major contractions. Gold, meanwhile, has held its value well, highlighting its appeal as a portfolio diversifier, the WGC report says. Seen as a safe haven asset, gold prices have been on an upward spiral since mid-August. According to their data, gold prices have surged nearly 7%. North Korea fears notwithstanding, major valuation averages are regularly hitting fresh all-time highs. As such, the gold-to-S&P 500 ratio is near 10-year lows, meaning the yellow metal is extremely undervalued, the World Gold Council says. Within the wider group of gold players, the junior exploration and mining companies could be the least expensive compared to their potential for upside as gold's price rises. BULLFROG GOLD ' S "" BARRICK "" PLAY  Based on the current upswing, undervalued junior mining concerns like Bullfrog Gold Corp. could be some of the best values. Bullfrog's flagship property, the Bullfrog Gold Project, is located 120 miles northwest of Las Vegas, Nevada in a well-known gold bearing region. The project includes an ex-Barrick pit that recovered 2,300,000 ounces, and the northern third of the Bullfrog deposit. While the region is well developed, Bullfrog Gold is currently showing the single steepest discount on gold-in-the-ground valuations. The Bullfrog Gold Project produced gold up until Barrick Gold ABE, +1.88% (ABE) and its partner terminated production in early 1999. It wasn't for lack of gold, but the economics of the project were different then, with gold averaging less than $290 per ounce. Innovations in mining have improved the economics of this play, and for Bullfrog, with the infrastructure already in place, along with the vital data that came with the property from Barrick, the project holds excellent value. Bullfrog Gold announced estimates in its 43-101 report in June 2017 of 525,000 ounces averaging 1.02 g/t using a gold price of $1200/oz and a base case cut-off grade of 0.36 g/t. Inferred resources were estimated at 120,000 ounces of gold averaging 1.20 g/t. With those kinds of economics and $1400 an ounce gold, Bullfrog would be a strong contender to bring gold to the production stage in short order. And $1400 an ounce is a real possibility. As O'Byrne reiterates, ""With the political situation in the U.S. and globally more uncertain than it has been in many years, gold will almost certainly continue to see robust safe-haven demand. This should push gold higher in the coming months."" Investors seem to agree and are getting in even earlier than expected - a cycle that will play itself out into winter. POTENTIAL COMPARABLES  Barrick Gold Corporation ABX, +0.48% Barrick is the gold mining leader, both in terms of size and low operating costs - its all-in sustaining costs (AISC) were down to just $730 per ounce last year. The gold miner also cranked out an impressive $1.5 billion in free cash flow in 2016, which may have contributed to a 42% dividend hike to investors last year. Analysts are predicting another huge dividend in 2017 of 47%. Second quarter 2017 earnings per share (EPS) were also up 57% over the second quarter of 2016, blowing out analysts' expectations. Randgold Resources GOLD, +1.12% Randgold Resources Limited explores for and develops gold deposits in Sub-Saharan Africa. It holds interests in the Morila gold mine, the Loulo gold mine, and the Gounkoto gold mine, which are located in Mali, West Africa; Tongon mine situated within the Nielle exploitation permit in the north of Côte d'Ivoire; and Kibali mine located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The company was founded in 1995 and is based in St. Helier, the Channel Islands. Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, +1.57% This Canadian gold producer is headquartered in Quebec and has a market cap of around CAD $13 billion ($10 billion USD). Its balance sheet shows low debt, with a debt-to-equity ratio hovering around 25%. Agnico Eagle reported second quarter 2017 EPS of $0.24, reflecting an average growth rate of roughly 140%, and second quarter revenue of $550 million was up 2.28% over the same period in 2016.

ABE,"PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 4, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- The Board of Directors of each of the Acquired Funds listed below, each of which is a closed-end investment company advised by one or more affiliates of Aberdeen Asset Management Inc., acting separately, announces that it has approved a consolidation of its respective Acquired Fund into the Acquiring Fund, subject to the receipt of necessary shareholder approvals by each Fund: Acquired Funds: Aberdeen Emerging Markets Smaller Company Opportunities Fund, Inc. (nyse american:ABE) Aberdeen Latin America Equity Fund, Inc. (nyse american:LAQ) Aberdeen Israel Fund, Inc. (nyse american:ISL) Aberdeen Indonesia Fund, Inc. (nyse american:IF) Aberdeen Singapore Fund, Inc. SGF, +2.47%   Aberdeen Greater China Fund, Inc. GCH, +3.22% Acquiring Fund: Aberdeen Chile Fund, Inc. (nyse american:CH) The consolidation of an Acquired Fund is subject to approval by the shareholders of each such Fund.  In addition,  the approval of the shareholders of the Acquiring Fund  will be required for  the changes to the Acquiring Fund described below and for the issuance of shares by the Acquiring Fund in connection with the consolidations. The Chairman of the Acquiring Fund said, ""We welcome inquiries from other closed-end funds whose shareholders may be attracted to an emerging markets equity income strategy about joining the consolidation."" The Board of Aberdeen Chile Fund, Inc. announces that it has approved the consolidation of each Acquired Fund into the Aberdeen Chile Fund, Inc. as well as changes to the Fund's name, ticker symbol, investment objective and certain investment policies. Some of the Acquiring Fund changes are subject to shareholder approval and, all changes, provided shareholder approval is obtained, would be effective upon the closing of a consolidation with one or more Acquired Funds (the ""Effective Date""). As a result of the proposed changes, as of the Effective Date, the Acquiring Fund will be renamed Aberdeen Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund, Inc. and will invest in emerging market equity securities in order to seek total return, consisting of a combination of capital appreciation and income. The Acquiring Fund may also use leverage to achieve its objective. It is anticipated that the Fund's benchmark would be the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. The Fund would trade on the NYSE American (formerly, NYSE MKT) under a new ticker symbol, expected to be AEF. The Aberdeen Emerging Markets Equity Income Fund, Inc. strategy will seek to capitalize on Aberdeen's global emerging market equity capability by investing in a global portfolio of emerging market securities. The consolidation of these closed-end funds will create a dividend generating emerging market closed-end fund that is larger in size than any of the Acquired Funds, which may help to provide improved liquidity of shares, a lower overall expense ratio and improved market awareness including research coverage. The combined fund is currently anticipated to generate higher distributable income compared to the Funds individually. Aberdeen and the Boards believe the combined fund will provide investors with the opportunity to have exposure to the growth potential of emerging markets and diversify their sources of income. Prior to the consolidation, an Acquired Fund may be required to make a capital gains distribution. Following the consolidation, the Acquiring Fund will commence a tender offer for shares of the Acquiring Fund at 99% of NAV. In addition, it is anticipated that the Acquiring Fund will realize capital gains in connection with reconfiguration of its portfolio following the consolidation. It is expected that assets distributed in the tender offer together  with capital gains accrued to-date by the Acquiring Fund and to be distributed in 2018 will aggregate up to a maximum distribution of 50%, and not less than 40%, of the net assets of the combined fund. The price, size and terms of the offer will be determined at a later date.  Subject to the completion of the consolidation, the current Board of the Acquiring Fund will also establish a targeted discount policy, which will seek to manage the Acquiring Fund's discount by: (1) committing the Fund to buy back shares in the open market when the Fund's shares trade at a discount of 10% or more to NAV and (2) undertaking a 15% tender offer if the average discount exceeds 11% over any rolling twelve-month period commencing on the closing of the consolidation and ending on December 31, 2019. The investment adviser(s) to each Fund and the Board of each Fund believe that the proposed consolidation is in the best interests of the shareholders of that Fund. Additional information regarding the consolidation and the combined fund will be presented in a combined prospectus/proxy statement sent to the Acquired Funds' shareholders and a proxy statement sent to the Acquiring Fund's shareholders. Acquiring Fund shareholders will be asked to vote on changes to the Fund's investment policies and other matters to restructure the Fund into one with an emerging markets equity income strategy to facilitate the proposed consolidation at a shareholder meeting targeted for the first quarter of 2018. Acquiring Fund shareholders will also be asked to approve the issuance of additional shares in connection with the consolidation. Shareholders of each Acquired Fund will be asked to vote on the reorganization of their fund into the Acquiring Fund at a special meeting currently targeted for early-second quarter 2018. The commencement and terms of the tender offer and the terms of the targeted discount policy (described above) are pursuant to a standstill agreement between the Funds and City of London Investment Management Company Limited (""CoL""). Pursuant to the agreement, CoL has agreed to (1) tender all shares of the Acquiring Fund beneficially owned by it in the proposed tender offer, (2) vote all shares beneficially owned in favor of all Director nominees and proposals submitted at the 2018 special and/or annual meetings to effect the consolidation and (3) be bound by certain ""standstill"" covenants through December 31, 2019. Also pursuant to that agreement, the Acquiring Fund's post-consolidation expense ratio will be capped at 1.20% through December 31, 2019 (excluding leverage costs, tax and non-routine/extraordinary expenses).

No offer of securities shall be made except by means of a prospectus meeting the requirements of Section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

ABE,"LOS ANGELES, September 27, 2017 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- LOS ANGELES, September 27, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- USA News Group - It's unusual for both gold and stocks to do well at the same time, but that's exactly what's happening right now. It seems the markets are wrestling with both fear and greed. Fear appears to be on top as gold gains. Emerging companies that could provide safe harbor from world events with gold resources in play include Pershing Gold PGLC, +1.49% Corvus Gold CORVF, +4.19% (KOR), Otis Gold OGLDF, +3.68% (OOO), and Bullfrog Gold Corp. BFGC, -0.88% It seems that confidence in the American economy has lifted the S&P 500 an impressive 9% higher this year. But gold, which is thought of as a safe place during times of fear, is doing even better. The precious metal has soared 12% this year to nearly $1,300 an ounce, putting it on track for the best performance since 2010. Major producers are enjoying the rally, alongside smaller companies who have significant gold resources under development. Being undervalued is a bonus for Bullfrog Gold Corp. (otcqb:BFGC), which is perfectly positioned to take advantage of this market with one of the best gold projects (based on price per ounce) in Nevada. The company is tapping a known region with very favorable mining it gained from a former Barrick operation. Other miners with strong gold in ground economics are part of the trend including Pershing Gold PGLC, +1.49% Corvus Gold (otcqx:CORVF), and Otis Gold OGLDF, +3.68% all of whom have interests gold resources on trend in Nevada. GOOD FOR GOLD?  One likely factor for gold's rise: investors who've been forced to chase the rising stock market are trying to hedge their bets just in case something goes wrong. But what could go wrong? Well aside from political unrest from the likes of North Korea and Iran, the markets are trying to grapple with hyper-growth, and a looming deadline to raise the U.S. debt ceiling among other things. Pundits say that looking ahead to the battles in Washington, gold is a ""smart and defensive way"" for investors to diversify their portfolio ahead of an increasingly uncertain near-term environment. Ray Dalio, the founder of the world's biggest hedge fund, warned that investors should have 5% to 10% of their assets in gold due to the risks of political instability. While political uncertainty can't be good for every sector, it's certainly put the focus on owning gold. QT IS AN X FACTOR  There is one factor that could also send gold soaring: QT or Quantitative Tightening. The U.S. Federal Reserve is embarking on a new path that started several years ago with QE (quantitative easing) and now must find its logical end. QT, which is the opposite of QE, is expected to have the same effect as raising interest rates. Ranging from 2008 to 2013 the Fed had three different spurts of QE. Eventually, it reduced (or tapered) its purchasing program to zero by 2014. The problem now is the Fed has been holding lots of extra reserve money. It is currently stuck with $4.5 trillion in bonds purchased on its balance sheet. The Fed has announced that it will begin shedding the excess bonds through QT by about $600 billion per year immediately. This is money that will come back out of the real economy. Many analysts are suggesting this could knock the wind out of the stock market and send stocks falling, triggering an even greater gold run. BULLFROG GOLD UNDERVALUED  If gold is to continue its strong hand, then undervalued producers like Bullfrog Gold Corp. could be some of the best values. The company's flagship property, known as the Bullfrog Gold Project, is located 120 miles to the NW of Las Vegas, Nevada, that includes an ex-Barrick pit that recovered 2,300,000 ounces, and the northern third of the Bullfrog deposit. Among the company's peers in the region, Bullfrog remains as the single steepest discount on gold-in-the-ground valuations. The Bullfrog Gold Project has already produced gold up until Barrick Gold ABE, +1.88% (ABE) terminated production in early 1999. The economics of the project were different then, as gold prices at the time averaged less than $290 per ounce. Innovation in the mining sector has improved the economics of this play, and for Bullfrog, with the infrastructure already in place, along with the mounds of data that came with the property, straight from the vaults Barrick, bring tremendous value to the project as a whole. Bullfrog Gold has announced estimates in its 43-101 report this June of 525,000 ounces averaging 1.02 g/t using a gold price of $1200/oz and a base case cutoff grade of 0.36 g/t. Inferred resources were estimated at 120,000 ounces of gold averaging 1.20 g/t. Bullfrog is approaching the project with all expediency; they want to bring it to the producing stage as quickly as possible. Whether juniors like Bullfrog Gold Corp. end up on top of the gold market push, there is something to be said for the exuberance about the shiny metal. Once again gold is proving itself to be a source of major profits for investors and safe haven against the unknown and unpredictable. POTENTIAL COMPARABLES  Pershing Gold PGLC, +1.49% Pershing Gold is an emerging Nevada gold producer on a fast-track to re-open the Relief Canyon Mine, which includes three open-pit mines and a state-of-the-art, fully permitted and constructed heap-leach processing facility. Pershing Gold is currently permitted to resume mining at Relief Canyon under the existing Plan of Operations. Corvus Gold (otcqx:CORVF) Corvus Gold Inc. is a North American gold exploration and development company, focused on its near-term gold-silver mining project at the 100% owned Nevada, North Bullfrog project. In addition the Company controls a number of royalties on other North American exploration properties representing a spectrum of gold, silver and copper projects. Corvus is committed to building shareholder value through new discoveries and the expansion of those discoveries to maximize share price leverage in a recovering gold and silver market. Otis Gold OGLDF, +3.68% Otis Gold has a resource estimate of 520,000 ounces on its Kilgore Project. The company is currently valued at $42.17 million, leaving their gold with a valuation of $81.10/oz of gold.
