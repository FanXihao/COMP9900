The company will consider the issuance of debt, equity or some combination to satisfy conversion-related cash requirements.

With the U.S. market for the artery devices estimated at $4 billion a year, Johnson & Johnson's stent has already been approved by the FDA. Barron's notes J&J attempts to block Boston Scientific with patent claims and says its examination of court transcripts suggest the maneuver might work.

Barron's looks at the pharmaceutical sector and notes that Pfizer PFE, +0.54% and Merck MRK, -1.13% carry lower price-to-earnings ratios than the S&P 500. Considering dividends, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% have 2 percent yields and Merck delivers 3 percent. Suggesting the entire sector appears to be a value, Barron's says it traditionally has similar P/E ratios as the technology sector, yet now is priced at about 62 percent of the technology multiple. St. Paul Cos. SPC, -2.57% saddled with major claim liabilities, could be a good value in the insurance sector, according to Barron's. As CEO since late in 2001, Jay Fishman has been pulling the company out of troubled coverage areas and has taken its annual loss down from $900 million in 2002 to an estimated $200 million in 2003. An 80 percent stake in Nuveen Investments, with $88 billion under management, is a potential source of ready cash if St. Paul's sells part of its stake, Barron's says. A continuing question mark, says Barron's, is the insurer's exposure to the energy industry, especially surety bonds tied to Aquila, which is facing federal regulatory scrutiny. Stifel Financial SF, +2.47% a financial holding company, said its board approved a stock buyback of up to 850,000 shares, about 12 percent of shares outstanding, for $13.25 a share.

ABM,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Intel took top billing in late trading Friday, heading up the most-actives' list on Island ECN for the second day running. Intel, a Dow component, said late Thursday it now expects sales in the current quarter of $7.6 billion to $7.8 billion, versus the $7.3 billion to $7.8 billion target range announced two weeks ago. See the story. Intel INTC, +5.00% shares were down 3 cents in recent dealings at $28.68.

Impath said it would continue to cooperate with the SEC. The company also said it didn't appeal the Nasdaq's decision to delist Impath shares, which are now listed on the OTC Pink Sheets. Shares of Impath closed at $4.05 on the over-the-counter market. They fell 5 cents in late trading but volume was extremely thin.

See full story. Shares of both companies stayed active after the closing bell. PeopleSoft added 3 cents in recent dealings, to change hands for $19.33, while shares of Oracle, which extended its tender offer for PeopleSoft shares yet again late Thursday, fell 4 cents to change hands for $13.04.

The price-to-earnings multiple on 2003 results is under 7 and the company pays an 8 percent dividend, Barron's notes. Investors are clearly worried by legal fights, but Barron's quotes Morgan Stanley analyst David Adelman as expecting the tobacco king to prevail in such cases as the Illinois suit over ""light"" cigarettes, a $74 billion verdict in Florida and the Justice Department's racketeering suit. Ampco System Parking, a subsidiary of ABM Industries ABM, +0.75% said late Friday that it bought parking property with $23 million in annual revenue from Valet Parking Service.

Dimon, a lieutenant of Sanford Weill during Travelers Group's buildup and merger with Citigroup, is credited with whipping Bank One into shape, though his cuts ruffled the feathers of 12 top executives who were cut loose, Barron's says. Shares dropped recently as Bank One fell short of analysts' earnings consensus by a penny, yet Barron's mocks critics of that miss. Bank One has enough cash that Dimon could have bought back some shares to artificially hit the target, Barron's says, adding that there's enough money in the bank to puff up earnings by 30 cents a share via buybacks.

In a potential blow to Disney's DIS, +1.93% Winnie the Pooh products, the Slesinger family said a federal judge's ruling rejected the Magic Kingdom's attempt to crush its copyright. Disney said in November that a granddaughter of Pooh author A.A. Milne had decided to cut off the Slesinger copyright, which was granted in the 1930s.

ABM,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- ABM Industries shares fell 2.2 percent Tuesday after the company said it lost nearly $1 million in its fourth quarter because of an extraordinary charge. ABM ABM, +0.75% which before Sept. 11 counted the World Trade Center as its biggest client, said Monday night that it lost $865,000, or 4 cents a share, in the quarter ended Oct. 31. A year earlier, the provider of services such as parking and building maintenance had posted a profit of $14.5 million, or 60 cents a share. Without the charge, which was a set-aside of $20 million to cover future self-insured losses, income would have come in at 46 cents per share, in line with the consensus estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call. Revenue for the period increased to $496.7 million, compared to revenue of $477.1 million in the same period the year before. Shares of ABM fell 69 cents, or 2.2 percent, to close at $31.31 Tuesday after being down as much as twice that earlier in the day. The company began as a one-man window-washing business in San Francisco in 1909. By 2001, it had a staff of more than 60,000, customers across North America and revenue for 2000 exceeding $1.8 billion. Its nine divisions include Ampco System Parking, ABM Janitorial and American Commercial Security. ABM's largest aggregate contract was the World Trade Center, with more than 800 staff from three divisions working there over a typical 24-hour period. The company lost 17 of those employees on Sept. 11. Annualized revenue from the combined permanent contracts at the World Trade Center totaled about $65 million, or 3 percent of total revenue, with gross profits of $10 million. ABM has filed a claim for more than $14.8 million in earnings losses and property damage with Zurich Financial Services. The company confirmed reports in its conference call Tuesday morning that Zurich had filed a lawsuit against ABM disputing claims made over the $10-million mark. Chief Financial Officer George Sundby said ABM was ""continuing to work with Zurich."" ABM said it expects full-year earnings for 2002 to come in between $2.10 and $2.20 per share before the recovery of any WTC-related insurance claims, largely due to a change in accounting rules for goodwill amortization. The firm also expects to continue with acquisitions, primarily in its janitorial and security divisions. ""I believe the number of companies available [for acquisitions] for multiples that will make economic sense for us are greater than they've ever been before,"" said President and CEO Henrik C. Slipsager. In light of its 50-cent-per-share charge in fiscal year 2001, ABM is taking a dose of preventive medicine and increasing its self-insurance rates by 21 percent for 2002, a charge that the company said it will pass on to clients. ""The big question is whether they can pass it all along to clients,"" said analyst David Gold of Sidoti Co., ""It will be hard to pass [the whole charge] on to clients in this economic environment."" Following the earnings release, Gold is maintaining his ""neutral"" rating on the stock. He doesn't recommend buying shares at this juncture. ""Going forward, things are too murky,"" he said. ""Next year is going to be tough for these guys.""

Among other provisions, the Tax Act provides for a reduction of the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% and a ""transition tax"" to be levied on the deemed repatriation of indefinitely reinvested earnings of international subsidiaries. Since we have an October 31 fiscal year-end, the lower corporate income tax rate will be phased in, resulting in a U.S. statutory federal rate of 23.3% for fiscal 2018 and 21% for subsequent fiscal years. Other provisions under the Tax Act will not be effective for us until fiscal 2019, including limitations on deductibility of interest and executive compensation as well as anti-deferral provisions on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (""GILTI""). As a result, in 2019 we expect our effective tax rate to increase from the 2018 rate. The estimated impact of the Tax Act, as summarized below for the three months ended January 31, 2018, is further described in Note 11, ""Income Taxes,"" in the Financial Statements. Three Months Ended (in millions) January 31, 2018 Remeasurement of U.S. deferred tax assets and liabilities $ 28.7 Transition tax on non-U.S. subsidiaries' earnings (7.0) Total impact of the Tax Act on the benefit for income taxes $ 21.7 Due to the complexities of implementing the provisions of the Tax Act, the staff of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin  Three Months Ended (in millions) January 31, 2018 Education $ 140.5 Technology & Manufacturing 58.6 Business & Industry 40.7 Healthcare 7.5 Aviation 4.3 Total $ 251.6  Following this acquisition, during 2018 we initiated a restructuring program to achieve cost synergies from our combined operations. We include these costs within corporate expenses. We do not expect to incur significant severance expenses related to GCA restructuring in the future.  Three Months Ended (in millions) January 31, 2018 Employee Severance $ 8.8 External Support Fees 2.0 Other Project Fees 0.8 Total $ 11.7  Segment Reporting Effective November 1, 2017, we reorganized our reportable segments to reflect the integration of GCA into our industry group model. Our reportable segments consist of Business & Industry (""B&I""), Aviation, Technology & Manufacturing (""T&M""), Education, Technical Solutions, and Healthcare, as further described below.  REPORTABLE SEGMENTS AND DESCRIPTIONS B&I, our largest reportable segment, encompasses janitorial, facilities engineering, and parking services [[Image Removed: fy18bni.jpg]] for commercial real estate properties and sports and entertainment venues. B&I also provides vehicle maintenance and other services to rental car providers (""Vehicle Services Contracts""). Aviation supports airlines and airports with services [[Image Removed: fy18aviationa01.jpg]] ranging from parking and janitorial to passenger assistance, catering logistics, air cabin maintenance, and transportation. T&M combines our legacy Industrial & Manufacturing business, which was previously included in our B&I [[Image Removed: fy18tnm.jpg]] segment, with our legacy High Tech industry group, which was previously reported as part of our Emerging Industries Group. T&M provides janitorial, facilities engineering, and parking services. Education delivers janitorial, custodial, landscaping and grounds, facilities engineering, and parking services for [[Image Removed: fy18educationa01.jpg]] public school districts, private schools, colleges, and universities. This business was previously reported as part of our Emerging Industries Group. Technical Solutions specializes in mechanical and [[Image Removed: fy18technicalsolutions.jpg]] electrical services. These services can also be leveraged for cross-selling across all of our industry groups, both domestically and internationally. Healthcare offers janitorial, facilities management, clinical engineering, food and nutrition, laundry and [[Image Removed: fy18healthcare.jpg]] linen, parking and guest services, and patient transportation services at traditional hospitals and non-acute facilities. This business was previously reported as part of our Emerging Industries Group.  Prior Year Reclassifications Effective with the reorganization of our reportable segments, we have revised our prior period segment information to conform with our fiscal 2018 presentation. These changes had no impact on our previously reported consolidated balance sheets, statements of comprehensive income (loss), or statements of cash flows. Government Services Business We sold our Government Services business on May 31, 2017. The reported results for this business are through the date of sale and future results could include run-off costs. As this business has been sold and is no longer part of our ongoing operations, we have excluded a discussion of its results for the periods in this report. Operating profit decreased by $4.3 million, or 18.2%, during the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2017. The decrease in operating profit is primarily attributable to higher amortization expense, incremental selling, general and administrative expenses, and restructuring and related costs associated with the GCA acquisition. This decrease was partially offset by higher operating profit in our Education and T&M segments associated with the GCA acquisition. Interest expense increased by $11.1 million during the three months ended January 31, 2018, as compared to the three months ended January 31, 2017, primarily related to increased indebtedness incurred to fund the GCA acquisition and higher relative interest rates under our credit facility. Our income taxes from continuing operations for the three months ended January 31, 2018 were favorably impacted by a net discrete tax benefit of $21.7 million related to the Tax Act. Net cash provided by operating activities was $33.7 million during the three months ended January 31, 2018. Dividends of $11.5 million were paid to shareholders, and dividends totaling $0.175 per common share were declared during the three months ended January 31, 2018. At January 31, 2018, total outstanding borrowings under our credit facility were $1.2 billion, and we had up to $330.5 million of borrowing capacity under our credit facility; however, covenant restrictions limited our actual borrowing capacity to $245.5 million.

ABM,"NEW YORK, Mar 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- ABM ABM, +0.75% a leading provider of facility solutions, announced that Brooks County Schools, headquartered in Quitman, Georgia will implement comprehensive infrastructure improvements through ABM's Energy Performance Contracting Program, with additional operational improvements provided by ABM's custodial services. ABM's customized solution is projected to save Brooks County Schools more than $10.5 million in energy and operating costs over a 15-year period by providing energy-efficiency enhancements within the schools' facilities, while also providing custodial services. ABM began making energy-efficiency improvements within the schools in February 2018, and are expected to complete them in January 2019. ""ABM is very excited to help Brooks County Schools implement an energy performance solution that helps improve the students' learning environment without cutting into their capital budget,"" said Mark Newsome, President of Technical Solutions at ABM. ""We are also able to provide Brooks County Schools a way to outsource custodial services with ABM by incorporating the cost of janitorial equipment into the energy performance contracting program, allowing them to fit the school system's custodial program within their existing budget."" ""At ABM, we're dedicated to keeping schools and universities clean, so staff can focus on doing what they do best -- educating young minds,"" said Mike Morris, President of ABM Education. ""We look forward to providing custodial service excellence throughout the school district."" Brooks County Schools' six school buildings were challenged by an aging infrastructure and reduced funding. With the majority of the school system's capital funds dedicated to paying an existing bond, administrators needed to address issues affecting the learning environment across the school system. In three of the school system's buildings - Brooks County Board of Education J.H. Wells Education Center, Quitman Elementary School and Brooks County Middle School - the HVAC units have outlived their useful life. Brooks County Board of Education J.H. Wells Education Center needs a new roof and throughout the school system, security cameras and a VOIP system are needed. ""ABM is delivering a customized solution to Brooks County Schools to remedy our infrastructure challenges,"" said Vickie Reed, Superintendent of Brooks County School System. ""ABM is providing facility, personnel and financial solutions that no other company has the processes or expertise to achieve."" ABM's Energy Performance Contracting Program will enable the school system to finance the replacement of its aging infrastructure. The program is designed as a financial solution to meet clients' technical facility needs and sustainability goals. The goal is to drive costs out of a client's operating budget, allowing savings to be reallocated to fund mission critical facility needs. Click here for a video on how ABM is providing facility and financial solutions to school districts without upfront costs or tax increases. While working in another school system, Reed worked with ABM to implement two Energy Performance Contracting Programs and to provide custodial services. ""The fact that the superintendent, who has been a client for years, brought ABM into Brooks County Schools to help with facility and financial solutions is a testament to the quality of service we provide,"" Newsome said. ""ABM is able to take a holistic look at Brooks County Schools' needs and provide efficiencies they may not be able to achieve otherwise."" Energy-efficiency enhancements include: Installing 15 new rooftop units at the Brooks County Board of Education J.H. Wells Education Center, and upgrading a number of units at other facilities to high-efficiency HVAC units All school system HVAC units will be controlled by state-of-the-art HVAC control systems to maximize energy and operational efficiency Ventilation systems at each of the school system's buildings will be upgraded, and each building will be sealed The Brooks County Board of Education J.H. Wells Education Center's roof will be replaced and coated, and a sprinkler system will be installed in the building's Pre-Kindergarten and Kindergarten wing Three of the school's cafeterias will undergo freezer monitoring and optimization, or refrigeration management programs to ensure systems are operating efficiently Security cameras, VOIP systems, and new water fountains and hand dryers will be installed across the entire school system For more information on ABM's Energy Performance Contracting Program and other offerings, visit www.abm.com.

These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a more representative understanding of underlying operational results and trends as well as the Company's operational performance. Management also uses Adjusted EBITDA as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. Please refer to the accompanying financial schedules for supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to certain GAAP financial measures. We round amounts in these schedules to millions and calculate all percentages and per-share data from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. As a result, certain amounts may not foot, crossfoot, or recalculate based on reported numbers due to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, all references to years are to our fiscal year, which ends on October 31. First Quarter Summary Broad-based total revenue growth of 19.7% driven predominantly by acquisitive revenue within the Education and Technology & Manufacturing segments. Organic revenue growth of 3.0% led by new wins and business expansions in the Business & Industry and Aviation segments. Lower Technical Solutions revenue due to the timing of backlog. The booking of a Technical Solutions cross-sell in a Georgia school district, exemplifying the Company's focus on cross-selling into its Education customers. Growth of 50.0% in income from continuing operations per diluted share driven primarily by a one-time tax benefit associated with the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and a reduction of the Company's overall corporate tax rate, partially offset by higher restructuring costs related to the 2017 acquisition of GCA Services Group (""GCA""). Lower adjusted income from continuing operations per diluted share reflecting increased interest expense, amortization and higher share count related to the GCA acquisition, which offset higher operating segment contribution and a lower overall corporate tax rate. Net income growth to $27.8 million compared to a loss of $56.8 million in the year ago period, which includes discontinued operations. Higher adjusted EBITDA of $65.1 million, or a margin rate of 4.1%, compared to $48.1 million, or a margin rate of 3.6% last year. First Quarter Results For the first quarter of fiscal 2018, the Company reported revenues of approximately $1.6 billion driven by the acquisition of GCA, and organic growth stemming from new domestic and international janitorial wins, janitorial and parking-related business expansions, and higher Work Order (tag) revenue within the Business & Industry segment. The Aviation segment also experienced strong organic growth stemming from parking, cabin cleaning, and expansion of catering logistics. Organic revenue growth was partially offset by lower revenue within the Technical Solutions segment. Acquisitions provided $253.9 million of incremental revenues during the quarter primarily related to GCA, which is predominantly reflected in the Education and Technology & Manufacturing segments in the amounts of $140.5 million and $58.6 million, respectively. On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations was $28.0 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $16.1 million, or $0.28 per diluted share last year. Income from continuing operations versus last year reflects a significant benefit stemming from The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted in December 2017. Due to this new legislation, the Company recorded a one-time net tax benefit of $21.7 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities which was partially offset by a tax expense associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings. Income from continuing operations for the quarter on both a GAAP and adjusted basis reflects higher amortization expense as a result of the GCA acquisition, which is embedded in each of the Company's reportable segments. Additionally, the Company ended the first quarter of fiscal 2018 with higher interest expense and 66.3 million weighted average shares outstanding on a diluted basis due to the GCA transaction. Income from continuing operations was primarily impacted by incremental revenue contribution in the Education and Technology & Manufacturing segments associated with the Company's GCA acquisition. These results were partially offset by higher corporate-related expenses primarily related to restructuring charges associated with GCA and investments in IT. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2018 was $17.4 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to $21.5 million, or $0.38 per diluted share for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The positive impact from a reduction in the Company's corporate tax rate and increased revenue contribution from GCA were offset by the aforementioned expenses and share count dilution attributable to the GCA acquisition. These results exclude items impacting comparability. A full description of items impacting comparability can be found in the ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" table. Net income for the first quarter of 2018 was $27.8 million, or $0.42 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $56.8 million, or $1.00 per diluted share last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was $65.1 million compared to $48.1 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 4.1% versus 3.6% last year. Mr. Salmirs continued, ""Our new reportable segments reflect an integrated ABM. With leadership in place and business plans taking shape, we are excited about the long-term potential for our Industry Groups. We are seeing early signs of cross-selling and continue to invest in our business development platform for greater efficiency and expansion."" Liquidity & Capital Structure The Company ended the quarter with total debt, including standby letters of credit, of $1.3 billion. Total debt to proforma adjusted EBITDA was approximately 4.0x. In addition, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.175 per common share for a total distribution of $11.5 million. Declaration of Quarterly Cash Dividend The Company also announced that the Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.175 per common share payable on May 7, 2018 to shareholders of record on April 5, 2018. This will be the Company's 208 [th] consecutive quarterly cash dividend. Guidance The Company now expects GAAP income from continuing operations of $1.88 to $1.98 per diluted share compared to its previously issued guidance of $1.33 to $1.43. Excluding items impacting comparability, adjusted income from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of $2.00 to $2.10 per diluted share for the 2018 fiscal year compared to its previously issued guidance range of $1.70 to $1.80. The Company's revised guidance outlook is primarily a result of the impact related to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. With the exception of the 2018 Work Opportunity Tax Credits and anticipated excess tax benefits on stock-based awards, this guidance does not include any potential benefits associated with certain other discrete tax items and other unrecognized tax benefits. Due to the complexity of reflecting the impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the company intends to continue reviewing the required analyses and accounting surrounding this tax impact throughout fiscal 2018. As such, the Company may further refine these estimates. Mr. Salmirs concluded, ""Given the benefit we will see from tax reform this year, we are pleased to have increased our guidance outlook. As previously discussed, we plan to use these tax proceeds to primarily deleverage, which aligns with our capital allocation priorities.""

[(b) ] Represents adjustments to our self-insurance reserve for general liability, workers' compensation and automobile claims related to prior period accident years. Management believes these prior period reserve changes do not illustrate the performance of the Company's normal ongoing operations given the current year's insurance expense is estimated by management in conjunction with the Company's outside actuary to take into consideration past history and current costs and regulatory trends. Once the Company develops its best estimate of insurance expense premiums for the year, the Company fully allocates such costs out to the business leaders to hold them accountable for the current year costs within operations. However, since these prior period reserve changes relate to claims that could date back many years, current management has limited ability to influence the ultimate development of the prior year changes. Accordingly, including the prior period reserve changes in the Company's current operational results would not depict how the business is run as the Company holds its management accountable for the current year's operational performance. The Company believes the exclusion of the self-insurance adjustment from income from continuing operations is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current year profitability. [(c) ] FY17 represents reimbursement of previously expensed legal and other costs incurred in connection with an internal investigation into a foreign entity affiliated with a former joint venture partner. [(d) ] The QTD FY18 period represents restructuring costs related to the GCA acquisition in September 2017; The QTD FY17 amount presents costs for the Company's 2020 Vision Transformation Initiative, net of the reversal of certain share-based compensation costs. [(e) ] The Company's tax impact is calculated using the federal and state statutory rate of 29.8% for QTD FY18, and 41.5% for QTD FY17, respectively. The tax impact of the impairment recovery and loss on sale related to the Company's Government Services business was calculated using a 39.0% tax rate for all periods presented. We calculate tax from the underlying whole-dollar amounts, as a result, certain amounts may not recalculate based on reported numbers due to rounding. [(f) ] FY18 QTD includes a tax benefit of $21.7M related to the enactment of the Tax Act.

This marked the Company's 207th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. ABM Industries' indicated dividend represents a yield of 1.83% compared to the average dividend yield of 1.86% for the Services sector. The Company has raised dividend for forty-nine consecutive years. Dividend Insights ABM Industries has a dividend payout ratio of 39.5%, which denotes that the Company spends approximately $0.40 for dividend distribution out of every $1.00 earned. The dividend payout ratio reflects how much amount a company is returning to shareholders versus how much money it is keeping on hand to reinvest in growth, to pay off debt, and/or to add to its cash reserves. According to analysts' estimates, ABM Industries is forecasted to report earnings of $2.16 per share for the next year, which is more than three times the Company's annualized dividend of $0.70 per share. As of October 31, 2017, ABM Industries' cash and cash equivalents totaled $62.8 million compared to $53.5 million as on December 31, 2016. For three months ended October 31, 2017, the Company's net cash used in operating activities totaled $19.8 million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of $8.4 million in the year-ago period. For the twelve months ended October 31, 2017, ABM Industries' net cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations was $101.7 million versus $110.5 million for the year-ago same period. The Company's strong financial position indicates its ability to absorb any fluctuations in earnings and cash flow and to sustain the dividend distribution for a long period.

We round amounts in these schedules to millions and calculate all percentages and per-share data from the underlying whole-dollar amounts. As a result, certain amounts may not foot, crossfoot, or recalculate based on reported numbers due to rounding. Unless otherwise noted, all references to years are to our fiscal year, which ends on October 31. Fourth Quarter Performance For the fourth quarter of 2017, revenues increased 13.3% to $1.5 billion, reflecting acquisitions of $178.5 million of incremental revenues primarily related to the Company's recent acquisition of GCA Services Group (""GCA""), which was acquired on September 1, 2017. For fiscal 2017, this business will be reported in the new segment ""GCA Services"". The Company reported organic growth of 2.3%, compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. The Company's organic revenue performance, which excludes acquisitions and divestitures, was driven primarily by both new business wins and expansions with existing clients within the Aviation and Business & Industry segments. The Company reported a loss from continuing operations of $2.5 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $9.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share last year. Adjusted income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $23.5 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, compared to $29.2 million, or $0.51 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. These results exclude items impacting comparability, predominantly related to as-expected acquisition costs associated with one-time transaction, synergy, and integration-related expenses following the closing of the Company's strategic acquisition of GCA. Items impacting comparability also include litigation and other settlement costs primarily related to two lawsuits concerning the Aviation segment's Seattle-area operations, a large portion of which the Company expects to be reimbursed in future quarters. As a reminder, income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016 reflects a non-cash, pre-tax impairment charge related to the Company's divested Government business. A full description of items impacting comparability can be found in the ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" table. Operationally, the Company's adjusted income from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of 2017 was impacted by reserves recorded for historical years' multi-employer union benefit obligations primarily impacting the Business & Industry segment, as well as client costs stemming from a previously-announced contract termination which occurred within the Company's Aviation segment during the third quarter of fiscal 2017. Additionally, income from continuing operations per diluted share for the quarter on an adjusted and non-adjusted basis reflects GCA-related share count dilution of approximately 10% and higher amortization expense. Total net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $3.6 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, compared to net income of $7.8 million, or $0.14 per diluted share last year. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $70.8 million compared to $61.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase in adjusted EBITDA was primarily driven by the Company's newly-acquired GCA business, revenue contribution, and higher procurement savings. Partially offsetting these results were the aforementioned client costs associated with the Company's Aviation segment, and an increase in reserves associated with historical multi-employer union benefit obligations. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the quarter was 4.7% versus 4.6% last year. Scott Salmirs, President and Chief Executive Officer of ABM Industries, commented, ""We achieved record revenue growth during the fourth quarter, reflecting our continued delivery of solid organic growth and our transformational acquisition of GCA. These results demonstrate the ongoing execution of our 2020 Vision initiatives. Our organization navigated the complexities of our highly diverse business and continued to accelerate, while beginning to integrate GCA's 40,000 employees and extensive client roster."" Fiscal 2017 Performance The Company reported revenues of approximately $5.5 billion, an increase of 6.0% for fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. This performance was driven by acquisitions of $208.1 million of incremental revenues during the fiscal year, primarily related to GCA. Organic revenues grew by 2.6%, stemming from new business wins, expansions with existing clients including greater Work Order (tag) sales within the Aviation and Business & Industry segments. Organic growth for fiscal 2017 excludes the Company's divested Government Services business, which was sold in May 2017. On a GAAP basis, income from continuing operations grew 25.3% to $78.1 million, or $1.34 per diluted share, compared to income from continuing operations of $62.3 million, or $1.09 per diluted share last year. Adjusted income from continuing operations for 2017 grew 2.8% to $101.9 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, compared to $99.2 million, or $1.74 per diluted share last year. These results exclude items impacting comparability, predominantly related to an impairment recovery related to the Company's Government Services business, a lower self-insurance adjustment, acquisition costs related to the GCA acquisition, and lower restructuring and related expenses. A full description of items impacting comparability can be found in the ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" table. Operationally, the Company's adjusted income from continuing operations was driven by procurement and organizational savings stemming from the Company's 2020 Vision initiative, which were partially offset by client costs stemming from a contract termination within the Company's Aviation segment. Additionally, income from continuing operations per diluted share for the quarter on an adjusted and non-adjusted basis reflects GCA-related share count dilution of approximately 3% and higher amortization expense. Total net income for 2017 was $3.8 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, compared to net income of $57.2 million, or $1.01 per diluted share last year. Adjusted EBITDA for 2017 was $236.7 million compared to $212.2 million in 2016. Adjusted EBITDA margin for 2017 was 4.3% versus 4.1% last year. The increases versus last year are primarily attributable to procurement and organizational savings from the Company's 2020 Vision initiatives, as well as the Company's newly-acquired GCA Services business. Liquidity & Capital Structure The Company ended the quarter with total debt, including standby letters of credit of $1.3 billion. Total debt to proforma adjusted EBITDA was approximately 3.93x. In addition, the Company paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.170 per common share for a total distribution of $11.1 million. Declaration of Quarterly Cash Dividend The Company also announced that the Board of Directors approved a 3.0% increase for the quarterly cash dividend to $0.175 per common share, payable on February 5, 2018 to stockholders of record on January 4, 2018. This marks ABM's 207th consecutive quarterly cash dividend. Guidance For fiscal 2018, the Company expects GAAP income from continuing operations of $1.33 to $1.43 per diluted share, or adjusted income from continuing operations of $1.70 to $1.80 per diluted share. With the exception of the 2018 Work Opportunity Tax Credits and anticipated excess tax benefits on stock-based awards, this guidance does not include any potential benefits associated with certain other discrete tax items and other unrecognized tax benefits. Mr. Salmirs continued, ""Fiscal 2017 was a momentous year for ABM as we operated for the first time under our new vertical, industry group organizational structure. During the year, we exceeded our Phase I expectations, and launched the 'ABM Way' which is the foundation of Phase II of our 2020 Vision strategy. Simultaneously, we identified process and technology tools and added talent to enable long term, profitable growth. The hard work of our organization yielded a substantial amount of progress in a short period of time. During 2018, we will continue to strengthen our organization through innovation and the continuation of the 'ABM Way', while focusing on our integration of GCA."" Beginning with the first quarter of 2018, the Company will change its reportable operating segments based on its recent acquisition of GCA Services Group. The Company expects to announce these new reportable operating segments at its 2018 Investor Day. 2018 Investor Day ABM will host an Investor Day in New York City on Thursday, January 18, 2018 with presentations given by members of executive management.

Cautionary Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 This press release contains both historical and forward-looking statements about ABM Industries Incorporated (""ABM"") and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as ""ABM,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our,"" or the ""Company""). We make forward-looking statements related to future expectations, estimates and projections that are uncertain, and often contain words such as ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""could,"" ""estimate,"" ""expect,"" ""forecast,"" ""intend,"" ""likely,"" ""may,"" ""outlook,"" ""plan,"" ""predict,"" ""should,"" ""target,"" or other similar words or phrases. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to known and unknown risks, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. For us, particular uncertainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those expressed in our forward-looking statements include: (1) we may not realize the growth opportunities and cost synergies that are anticipated from the acquisition of GCA; (2) we have incurred a substantial amount of debt to complete the acquisition of GCA, and to service our debt we will require a significant amount of cash; (3) changes in our businesses, operating structure, financial reporting structure or personnel relating to the implementation of our 2020 Vision, may not have the desired effects on our financial condition and results of operations; (4) our success depends on our ability to gain profitable business despite competitive pressures and on our ability to preserve long-term client relationships; (5) our business success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and senior management; (6) our use of subcontractors or joint venture partners to perform work under customer contracts exposes us to liability and financial risk; (7) our international business involves risks different from those we face in the United States that could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition; (8) unfavorable developments in our class and representative actions and other lawsuits alleging various claims could cause us to incur substantial liabilities; (9) we insure our insurable risks through a combination of insurance and self-insurance and we retain a substantial portion of the risk associated with expected losses under these programs, which exposes us to volatility associated with those risks, including the possibility that changes in estimates of ultimate insurance losses that could result in a material charge against our earnings; (10) our risk management and safety programs may not have the intended effect of reducing our liability for personal injury or property loss; (11) impairment of goodwill and long-lived assets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations; (12) changes in general economic conditions could reduce the demand for facility services and, as a result, reduce our earnings and adversely affect our financial condition; (13) our business may be materially affected by changes to fiscal and tax policies and negative or unexpected tax consequences could adversely affect our results of operations; (14) we could be subject to cyber-security risks, information technology interruptions, and business continuity risks; (15) a significant number of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements which could expose us to potential liabilities in relationship to our participation in multiemployer pension plans, requirements to make contributions to other benefit plans, and the potential for strikes, work slowdowns or similar activity and union-organizing drives; (16) if we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be negatively impacted, which could harm our operating results, investors' perceptions, and the value of our common stock; (17) our business may be negatively impacted by adverse weather conditions; (18) catastrophic events, disasters, and terrorist attacks could disrupt our services; and (19) actions of activist investors could disrupt our business. The list of factors above is illustrative and by no means exhaustive. Additional information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties we face is contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended October 31, 2016 and in other reports we file from time to time with the Securities and Exchange Commission (including all amendments to those reports). We urge readers to consider these risks and uncertainties in evaluating our forward-looking statements. We caution readers not to place undue reliance upon any such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date made. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise, except as required by law. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information To supplement ABM's consolidated financial information, the Company has presented income from continuing operations as adjusted for items impacting comparability, for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016. These adjustments have been made with the intent of providing financial measures that give management and investors a better understanding of the underlying operational results and trends as well as ABM's marketplace performance. In addition, the Company has presented earnings before income from discontinued operations, net of taxes, interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and excluding items impacting comparability (adjusted EBITDA) for the fourth quarter and twelve months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016. Adjusted EBITDA is among the indicators management uses as a basis for planning and forecasting future periods. The presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

and trends of the Company. [(b) ] Represents adjustments to our self-insurance reserve for general liability, workers' compensation and automobile claims related to prior period accident years. Management believes these prior period reserve changes do not illustrate the performance of the Company's normal ongoing operations given the current year's insurance expense is estimated by management in conjunction with the Company's outside actuary to take into consideration past history and current costs and regulatory trends. Once the Company develops its best estimate of insurance expense premiums for the year, the Company fully allocates such costs out to the business leaders to hold them accountable for the current year costs within operations. However, since these prior period reserve changes relate to claims that could date back many years, current management has limited ability to influence the ultimate development of the prior year changes. Accordingly, including the prior period reserve changes in the Company's current operational results would not depict how the business is run as the Company holds its management accountable for the current year's operational performance. The Company believes the exclusion of the self-insurance adjustment from income from continuing operations is useful to investors by enabling them to better assess our operating performance in the context of current year profitability.

We calculate tax from the underlying whole-dollar amounts, as a result, certain amounts may not recalculate based on reported numbers due to rounding.

ABM,"NEW YORK, Nov 09, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- ABM ABM, +0.75% a leading provider of facility solutions, has initiated an Energy Performance Contracting program for Connellsville Area School District in Fayette County, Pennsylvania. ABM's customized solution is projected to save Connellsville Area School District more than $26.4 million in energy and operating costs over a 15-year period, which district officials plan to use to finance educational and technological initiatives across the district. The project launched on July 1, 2017 and is scheduled for completion in October 2018. Energy and operational savings will be achieved by implementing infrastructure upgrades to multiple facilities in the district, including four elementary schools, Connellsville Area High School, Connellsville Area Middle School, and the Connellsville Area Career and Technology Center. The district is using the project to help cut operational costs without sacrificing educational opportunities, as part of a three-year strategic financial recovery plan. ""Connellsville Area School District's turnaround is ambitious and sets the district apart from others,"" said Mark Newsome, President of ABM Technical Solutions. ""The district is well-positioned to enhance its students' educational experiences by working with ABM to realize the savings our Energy Performance Contracting program can provide."" Philip Martell, Superintendent of Connellsville Area School District, said, ""It is the perfect time to partner with ABM. We have operational issues across the board, but for us, the selling point of the project is the educational benefit to our students."" He continued, ""This partnership allows us to upgrade not only the facilities and security in our building, but also the technology. This project gives us the stability to move ahead with an educational component that a lot of public education institutions cannot due to funding cuts."" Earlier this year, the Connellsville Area School District consolidated its eight elementary schools into four, in an effort to align its operational budget with enrollment and improve its students' learning environment. ABM's Energy Performance Contracting program enables the Connellsville Area School District to address the operational issues and aging infrastructure of its buildings without burdening the district's taxpayers. The program enables district officials to retrofit and upgrade most of its buildings systems, while continuing to move toward technology-based educational programming for its students. ""A project like this provides us the ability to make educational upgrades we may not have been able to do otherwise because of a lack of funding,"" Martell said. ""There are a lot of districts that may not be able to take on a project, like putting devices in students hands, right now, but they can do it, too, with the right help. For us, that was the partnership with ABM."" In each of the buildings, ABM will work to improve HVAC systems and maintenance, lighting, water conservation, and energy management systems. ABM's Energy Performance Contracting program is a financial solution that meets clients' technical facility needs and sustainability goals. It drives costs out of clients' operating budgets and allows savings to be reallocated to fund educational and capital expenses. Click here for a video on how ABM is providing facility and financial solutions to school districts without upfront costs or tax increases. Along with upgrading the school district's infrastructure, the solution is expected to produce enough general fund savings to purchase each student a Chromebook laptop computer, upgrade televisions, install SMART Boards in classrooms, and upgrade the wireless internet network throughout each of the district's buildings. ""Ultimately, the goal of our partnership with ABM is to provide educational opportunities for our students and staff and help us meet our buildings' needs to create an environment conducive to learning,"" Martell said. ""ABM's creative solution will help us address our daily operational needs, while redirecting funding toward educational programming.""
