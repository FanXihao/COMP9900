OCIP,"OCI Partners LP said its initial public offering of 17.5 million common units priced at $18 a piece, below its expected range. OCI Partners, which owns and operates an integrated methanol and ammonia production facility located on the Texas Gulf Coast near Beaumont, initially filed plans for an IPO of up to $480 million in common stock in June. It plans to use proceeds to repay debt and for general partnership purposes. The company last week estimated the units to price between $19 and $21 a piece. The limited partnership is the largest merchant methanol producer in the U.S., with an annual methanol production capacity of about 730,000 metric tons and an annual ammonia production capacity of about 265,000 metric tons, according to a regulatory filing. The company is in the early stages of a debottlenecking project that should increase its annual methanol production capacity by 25% and its annual ammonia production capacity by 15%. OCI Partners hopes to use some of the proceeds from this offering to pay a portion of the project's costs. For the year ended Dec. 31, OCI reported a profit of $61.7 million and revenue of $224.6 million. The company's units will begin trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday under the symbol ""OCIP.""

OCIP,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes presented in this report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on the views and beliefs of our management, as well as assumptions and estimates made by our management. Actual results could differ materially from such forward-looking statements as a result of various risk factors, including those that may not be in control of management. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed elsewhere in this report, particularly, but not limited to, those set forth in Item 1A-""Risk Factors"" and under ""Forward-Looking Statements."" OVERVIEW We are a Delaware limited partnership formed in February 2013 to own and operate a recently upgraded, integrated methanol and ammonia production facility that is strategically located on the Texas Gulf Coast near Beaumont. We are currently one of the larger merchant methanol producers in the United States, with an annual methanol production design capacity of approximately 912,500 metric tons and an annual ammonia production design capacity of approximately 331,000 metric tons. Both methanol and ammonia are global commodities that are essential building blocks for numerous end-use products. Methanol is a liquid petrochemical that is used in a variety of industrial and energy-related applications. The primary use of methanol is to make other chemicals, with approximately 42% of global methanol demand being used to produce formaldehyde, acetic acid and a variety of other chemicals that form the foundation of a large number of chemical derivatives. These derivatives are used to produce a wide range of products, including adhesives for the lumber industry, plywood, particle board and laminates, resins to treat paper and plastic products, and also paint and varnish removers, solvents for the textile industry and polyester fibers for clothing and carpeting. Energy-related applications consume approximately 29% of methanol demand. In recent years, there has been a strong demand for methanol in energy applications such as gasoline blending, biodiesel and as a feedstock in the production of DME, MTBE, particularly in China. Methanol blending in gasoline is currently not permitted in the United States. MTO consumes the remaining 29% of global methanol demand as the MTO segment in China has grown by approximately 44% from 2016 to 2017, causing China to become increasingly reliant on imported methanol. Ammonia, produced in anhydrous form (containing no water) from the reaction of nitrogen and hydrogen, constitutes the base feedstock for nearly all of the world's nitrogen chemical production. In the United States, ammonia is primarily used as a feedstock to produce nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea and ammonium sulfate, and is also directly applied to soil as a fertilizer. In addition, ammonia is widely used in industrial applications, particularly in the Texas Gulf Coast market, including in the production of plastics, synthetic fibers, resins and numerous other chemical derivatives. On December 6, 2016, OCIP received a proposal from OCI pursuant to which OCI would acquire the publicly held common units not already directly or indirectly owned by OCI in exchange for OCI shares at an exchange ratio of 0.5200 OCI shares for each common unit. On April 14, 2017, after negotiations with the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner regarding the Proposed Transaction reached an impasse, OCI informed representatives of the conflicts committee that no acceptable definitive agreement regarding the Proposed Transaction could be reached and terminated negotiations with the conflicts committee regarding the Proposed Transaction. On February 20, 2018, we announced that we had priced a proposed $455 million term loan B facility and proposed $40 million revolving credit facility. The proposed New Term Loan is expected to mature in 2025, and is expected to be priced at the LIBOR plus 425 basis points. We intend to use the expected net proceeds of the New Term Loan to repay in full our Term Loan B Credit Facility and to repay in full outstanding intercompany loans from OCI. The commitments in respect of the New Term Loan and New Revolving Credit Facility and the terms and conditions thereof (including the applicable interest rates) remain subject to the execution of definitive documentation with respect to the New Term Loan and New Revolving Credit Facility. The closing of the New Term Loan and New Revolving Credit Facility is expected to occur in March 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions. Assuming our New Term Loan closes with an expected pricing of LIBOR plus 425 basis points, we expect a reduction of approximately $10 million per year of interest and principal payments on our New Term Loan based on the LIBOR as of March 5, 2018. Table of Contents FACTORS AFFECTING COMPARABILITY OF FINANCIAL INFORMATION Table of Contents The methanol industry experienced a wave of global plant closures between 1998-2007 due to high natural gas prices as well as generally weaker demand for chemicals. During this period, numerous U.S. methanol facilities were shut down or relocated to other countries, resulting in the inability of current U.S. production capacity to meet current U.S. methanol demand. However, a long period of low natural gas prices in the United States has made it economical for companies to upgrade existing plants and initiate construction of new methanol and nitrogen projects. For example, Methanex and the Celanese-Mitsui joint venture have brought their new methanol facilities online in the last three years and Natgasoline, in which OCI indirectly owns a 50% interest, is currently in the construction phase on its 1.8 million metric ton methanol facility in Beaumont, Texas, and has stated that it expects to commence operations in the second quarter of 2018. In addition, Yuhuang Chemical and several other developers have announced plans to construct methanol plants in the U.S. Gulf Coast region over the next few years, which, if constructed, would increase overall U.S. production capacity and the availability of methanol supply to our customers from competing sources. However, over the past few years, several methanol projects have been canceled or delayed as a result of higher capital expenditure estimates than originally anticipated, among other reasons. Nevertheless, it is expected that the U.S. will become self-sufficient in the next few years, eventually becoming a net exporter. Table of Contents Natural Gas Prices  Amount spent on Natural Gas Quantity Purchased Average Cost per MMBtu (in millions) (in MMBtu) $/MMBtu Year-ended December 31, 2017 $116.4 37,238,062 $3.13 2016 $97.6 37,921,992 $2.57 2015 $81.7 29,959,223 $2.73  We have connections to one major interstate and three major intrastate natural gas pipelines that provide us access to significantly more natural gas supply than our facility requires and flexibility in sourcing our natural gas feedstock. Our facility is connected to natural gas pipelines owned by Kinder Morgan, Houston Pipe Line Company, Florida Gas Transmission and DCP Midstream Partners, LP. We are currently receiving our natural gas from Kinder Morgan and Houston Pipe Line Company though our direct pipeline connections with those companies, and from Enterprise Products through our direct pipeline connection with Florida Gas Transmission. We believe that we have ready access to an abundant supply of natural gas for the foreseeable future due to our location and connectivity to major natural gas pipelines. Table of Contents We are party to ammonia sales contracts with several customers, including but not limited to Interoceanic Corporation (""IOC"") and Lucite. Our customers have no minimum volume purchase obligations under these contracts, may determine not to purchase any more ammonia from us at any time and may purchase ammonia from other suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, these contracts set our pricing terms to reflect a specified discount to a published monthly benchmark ammonia price (CFR Tampa), and our ammonia is sold on an FOB basis when delivered by barge, pipeline, and our ammonia truck loading facility. For the year ended December 31, 2017, ammonia sales contracts with IOC accounted for approximately 8% of our total revenues. Table of Contents How We Evaluate Our Operations our operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other publicly traded partnerships, without regard to financing methods and capital structure. EBITDA should not be considered an alternative to net income (loss), operating income (loss), net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA may have material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations. In addition, EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation because each company may define EBITDA differently. Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS  For the Year Ended For the Year Ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Metric Tons Revenue Metric Tons Revenue (in thousands) (in thousands) Revenues: Ammonia 318.9 $ 76,546 325.1 $ 83,978 Methanol-Procured 10.9 3,438 - - Methanol-Produced 810.9 263,326 818.7 174,236 Other - 15 - 15 Total 1,140.7 $ 343,325 1,143.8 $ 258,229  Our total revenues were approximately $343 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately $258 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our methanol revenues were approximately $267 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately $174 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, which is a 53% increase. The increase in methanol revenues is due to an increase in the average sales price per metric ton of methanol. Our ammonia revenues were approximately $77 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to approximately $84 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, representing a 9% decrease. The decrease in ammonia revenues is due to a decrease in the average sales price per metric ton of ammonia, and lower ammonia sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016.

OVERVIEW Table of Contents Hurricane Harvey Table of Contents Ammonia. The fertilizer industry is the major end-user of ammonia, with approximately 80% used for the production of various fertilizers or, to a much lesser extent, for direct application into the ground. Ammonia is also used to produce various industrial products including blasting/mining compounds (ammonium nitrate); fibers and plastics (acrylonitrile, caprolactam and other nylon intermediates, isocyanates and other urethane intermediates, amino resins); and NOx emission reducing agents (ammonia, urea) among others. While these non-fertilizer applications only account for approximately 18% of global ammonia demand, this sector plays a much more significant role in demand for imported ammonia, accounting for over 30% of global trade in ammonia. In the United States, there is a meaningful correlation between demand for nitrogen fertilizer products and crop prices. Demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers. Individual farmers make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest, while the specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on many factors, including crop prices, their current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. High crop prices incentivize farmers to increase fertilizer application in order to maximize crop yields. Thus, high crop prices tend to buoy fertilizer demand, resulting in higher demand for ammonia. In addition, the industry typically experiences seasonal fluctuations in demand, because farmers tend to apply nitrogen fertilizer during two short periods, one in the spring and the other in the fall. Natural Gas Prices Table of Contents Key Operational Factors Table of Contents Potential Impact of Final IRS Regulations Regarding Qualifying Income In order to maintain our status as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, 90% or more of our gross income in each tax year must be ""qualifying income"" under Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Internal Revenue Code""). If less than 90% of our gross income is qualifying income in any tax year, then we would be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes for such tax year and all subsequent tax years. Prior to our initial public offering, we requested and received a favorable private letter ruling from the IRS to the effect that the income derived from processing and marketing gasoline, liquefied petroleum gas, methanol and synthesis gas produced through the processing of natural gas would constitute qualifying income.

OCIP,"NEDERLAND, Texas, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- OCI Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership (""we"" or the ""Partnership""), announced its results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. The Partnership owns and operates an integrated methanol and ammonia production facility that is strategically located on the Texas Gulf Coast near Beaumont. Summary of Financial Results for the Three Months Ended December 31, 2017 Revenues increased 48% to $98 million compared to $66 million for the same period in 2016 Net income improved to $13 million from a net loss of $17 million for the same period in 2016 EBITDA increased 138% to $38 million compared to $16 million for the same period in 2016 EBITDA and net income (loss) margins were 39% and 13% respectively, compared to 24% and (26)%, respectively, during the same period in 2016 Summary of Financial Results for the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2017 Revenues increased 33% to $343 million compared to $258 million in 2016 Net income improved to $24 million from a net loss of $51 million in 2016 EBITDA increased 115% to $127 million compared to $59 million in 2016 EBITDA and net income (loss) margins were 37% and 7% respectively, compared to 23% and (20)%, respectively, in 2016 P lacing of New $455M Term Loan B The Partnership previously announced on February 20, 2018 the pricing of a proposed $455 million term loan B facility (the ""Term Loan B Facility"") and proposed $40 million revolving credit facility (the ""Revolving Credit Facility""). The Term Loan B Facility is expected to be priced at LIBOR + 425 bps, mature in 2025, and include a leverage-based stepdown provision. The Revolving Credit Facility priced at LIBOR + 375 bps, with a maturity in 2020. The Partnership intends to use the expected net proceeds of the Term Loan B Facility to repay in full its existing $232 million facility and to repay in full outstanding intercompany loans from OCI N.V. of $200 million. The commitments in respect of the Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility and the terms and conditions thereof (including the applicable interest rates) remain subject to the execution of the definitive documentation. The closing of the Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Credit Facility is expected to occur in March 2018 and is subject to customary closing conditions. Distributions Based on the results of the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership has approved a cash distribution of $0.27 per common unit, or approximately $23.5 million in the aggregate. The cash distribution will be paid on April 6, 2018 to unitholders of record at the close of business on March 23, 2018. The amount of any subsequent quarterly cash distributions will vary depending on our future earnings as well as our cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other contractual obligations, and reserves for future operating or capital needs. Run-Rate Quarterly Distribution Our distribution of $0.27 with respect to the three months ended December 31, 2017 reflects an average realized methanol price of $319 per metric ton, an average realized ammonia price of $246 per metric ton, and an average natural gas price of $3.00 per MMBtu. To assist investors in making the linkage between these prices and potential future distributions, we provide below a sensitivity analysis assuming 95% on stream time with 99% capacity utilization: A $0.50 per MMBtu change in annual average natural gas prices would result in an approximately $0.25 impact on annual distributions per common unit A $10 per metric ton change in annual average methanol prices would result in an approximately $0.10 impact on annual distributions per common unit A $10 per metric ton change in annual average ammonia prices would result in an approximately $0.04 impact on annual distributions per common unit In addition to the impact of commodity prices, our distributions are subject to fluctuations in capacity utilization, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other contractual obligations, reserves for future operating or capital needs and other factors, including overall business, regulatory and financial considerations that may affect the availability of cash to distribute. Please see ""Forward-Looking Statements"" below. We intend to review our run-rate quarterly distribution following the expected closing of the Term Loan B facility to reflect our capital structure and other factors. Statement from President and Chief Executive Officer – Ahmed El-Hoshy ""I am very pleased that we continued our excellent safety track record throughout 2017 with no OSHA recordable or lost time incidents. I would like to thank all our employees for their continued support to maintaining a safe and healthy working environment, which, given the nature of our operations, is of the highest importance to us. ""Our ammonia and methanol production units operated efficiently during the quarter and both experienced three days of downtime, resulting in capacity utilization rates of 102% and 97%, respectively. ""Methanol prices increased compared to the same quarter last year and compared to the third quarter of 2017, benefiting from good demand from both the Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) sector in China and global construction activity, as well as tight supply. Our average realized methanol price was $319 per metric ton in the fourth quarter, an increase of 24% from $257 per metric ton in the same quarter last year, and an increase of 7% from $299 per metric ton in the third quarter of 2017. ""After reaching multi-year low levels in the third quarter of 2017, ammonia prices increased throughout the fourth quarter, driven by firming phosphate and urea end markets and several supply curtailments in key export hubs. Our average realized ammonia price was $246 per metric ton in the fourth quarter, up 24% from $199 per metric ton in the same quarter last year and up 33% from $185 per metric ton in the third quarter of 2017. ""I am very pleased with our operational and financial performance during the quarter. EBITDA improved significantly compared to the same quarter last year, mainly due to comparatively higher sales volumes and higher realized methanol and ammonia prices during the quarter, slightly lower natural gas costs of on average $3.00 per MMBtu and our continued focus on cost management. ""Looking forward to the first quarter of 2018, we expect our business to benefit from a recent increase in methanol and ammonia prices. The US weighted average methanol contract price continued to increase in 2018 from $393 per metric ton on average in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $490 per metric ton on average in the first quarter of 2018. The monthly Tampa CFR ammonia contract price increased from $345 per metric ton in December to $355 per metric ton in January, but has since then decreased to reach $305 per metric ton in March. On average, the Tampa CFR ammonia contract price has been at higher levels in the first quarter of 2018 than in the fourth quarter of 2017. ""We also look forward to closing our recently announced new Term Loan B Facility and Revolving Credit Facility in the coming weeks, which will allow us to markedly reduce our debt service costs and increase maturities.""

EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our unaudited financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess: the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; and our operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other publicly traded partnerships, without regard to financing methods and capital structure. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA may have material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations. In addition, EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation because each company may define EBITDA differently. EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by revenues.

OCIP,"NEDERLAND, Texas, Aug. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- OCI Partners LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the ""Partnership""), announced its results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. The Partnership owns and operates an integrated methanol and ammonia production facility that is strategically located on the Texas Gulf Coast near Beaumont. Summary of Financial Results for the Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 Revenues increased 32% to $74 million compared to $56 million for the same period in 2016 EBITDA increased 140% to $24 million compared to $10 million for the same period in 2016 Net loss of $1 million compared to a net loss of $15 million for the same period in 2016 EBITDA and net loss margins were 32% and (1)% respectively, compared to 18% and (27)%, respectively, during the same period in 2016 Summary of Financial Results for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Revenues increased 33% to $167 million compared to $126 million for the same period in 2016 EBITDA increased 125% to $63 million compared to $28 million for the same period in 2016 Net income of $12 million compared to a net loss of $22 million for the same period in 2016 EBITDA and net income (loss) margins were 38% and 7% respectively, compared to 22% and (17)%, respectively, during the same period in 2016 Unplanned Shutdown As previously announced, on April 27, both the methanol and ammonia plants tripped and upon restart a leak was discovered in one of the waste heat boilers that needed to be repaired. The Partnership decided to take the opportunity to carry out several other repairs, which were previously scheduled for a later date, but management accelerated the timing of these repairs while the plants were down. The ammonia plant was restarted on May 2, but was running at reduced capacity utilization rates until the restart of the methanol plant on May 22. Since the restart of the methanol plant, both plants have been running at average utilization rates above nameplate capacity. Distributions Based on the results of the three months ended June 30, 2017, the Board of Directors of the general partner of the Partnership has approved a cash distribution of $0.12 per common unit or approximately $10.4 million in the aggregate. The cash distribution will be paid on September 8, 2017 to unitholders of record at the close of business on August 18, 2017. The amount of any subsequent quarterly cash distributions will vary depending on our future earnings as well as our cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other contractual obligations, and reserves for future operating or capital needs. Run-Rate Quarterly Distribution Guidance Partnership distributions, including the distribution of $0.12 being declared with respect to the three months ended June 30, 2017, remain largely consistent with our prior run-rate guidance, where the run-rate distribution amount is primarily affected each quarter for changes in average realized prices of methanol, ammonia and natural gas. Our distribution with respect to the three months ended June 30, 2017 reflects an average realized methanol price of $331 per metric ton, an average realized ammonia price of $291 per metric ton, and an average natural gas price of $3.32 per MMBtu. The lost volume resulting from the unplanned shutdown had a negative impact of approximately $0.13 on the distribution for the three months ended June 30, 2017, based on average contribution margins for the second quarter of 2017. To assist investors in making the linkage between these prices and potential future distributions, we provide below a sensitivity analysis assuming full utilization: A $0.50 per MMBtu change in annual natural gas prices results in an approximately $0.23 impact on annual distributions A $10 per metric ton change in annual methanol prices results in an approximately $0.10 impact on annual distributions A $10 per metric ton change in annual ammonia prices results in an approximately $0.04 impact on annual distributions We intend to continue making distributions consistent with our run-rate guidance, but there can be no assurance we will be able to do so. In addition to the impact of commodity prices, our distributions are subject to fluctuations in capacity utilization, working capital, capital expenditures, debt service and other contractual obligations, reserves for future operating or capital needs and other factors, including overall business, regulatory and financial considerations that may affect the availability of cash to distribute. Please see ""Forward-Looking Statements"" below."" Statement from President and Chief Executive Officer – Ahmed El-Hoshy ""During the quarter, as a result of the unplanned shutdown in April and May, our ammonia and methanol production units experienced 6 and 25 days of downtime, resulting in capacity utilization rates of 87% and 72%, respectively. We are pleased that the plants have been running consistently at rates above nameplate capacity since both plants were back up and running. Despite the unplanned shutdown and higher natural gas costs compared to last year, second quarter EBITDA improved compared to the same quarter last year, benefiting from comparatively higher realized prices for methanol during the quarter. After the rapid increase in US weighted average methanol contract prices during the first quarter, prices started to decline towards the end of March and into the second quarter, largely due to the return of supply from various methanol plants following turnarounds, and reduced Methanol-to-Olefins (MTO) operating rates in China. After reaching a high of $491 per metric ton in March, the contract price declined to $377 per metric ton in June. Ammonia prices (Tampa cfr) also improved rapidly during the first quarter and reached $330 per metric ton in May before the June contract price dropped to $265 per metric ton. Our average realized methanol price was $331 per metric ton in the second quarter, an increase of 72% from $192 per metric ton in the same quarter last year and a drop of 6% from $353 per metric ton in the first quarter of 2017. Our average realized ammonia price was $291 per metric ton in the second quarter, down 3% from $301 per metric ton in the same quarter last year, but up 18% from $247 per metric ton in the first quarter of 2017. Finally, our natural gas price averaged $3.32 per MMBtu during the quarter, up from $2.13 per MMBtu during the second quarter of 2016, offsetting some of the benefits of the higher pricing. Looking forward, methanol spot prices have been relatively stable in the past few months. The US weighted average methanol contract price was $367 per metric ton for July and $370 per metric ton for August, only slightly below the $377 per metric ton in June and at levels that generate healthy returns for our operations. The lower prices have resulted in improved economics and increases in Chinese MTO operating rates during the second quarter and into the third.

EBITDA is used as a supplemental financial measure by management and by external users of our unaudited financial statements, such as investors and commercial banks, to assess: the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods, capital structure or historical cost basis; and our operating performance and return on invested capital compared to those of other publicly traded partnerships, without regard to financing methods and capital structure. EBITDA should not be considered as an alternative to net income, operating income, net cash provided by operating activities or any other measure of financial performance or liquidity presented in accordance with GAAP. EBITDA may have material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes items that are necessary elements of our costs and operations. In addition, EBITDA presented by other companies may not be comparable to our presentation because each company may define EBITDA differently. EBITDA margin is defined as EBITDA divided by revenues. EBITDA margin is used as a supplemental financial measure by the Partnership's management in its analysis of our operating performance. The tables below reconcile EBITDA to net income, its most directly comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP, for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 (dollars in thousands).
