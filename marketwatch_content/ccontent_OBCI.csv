OBCI,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Robert Auer, senior portfolio manager for the Auer Growth, says that an investor using a rigid methodology to pick stocks during a turbulent market might expect to find fewer names when market conditions are difficult and frothy. Instead, Auer has found the opposite, noting that his fund, which looks for ""growth at a ridiculous price,"" now has about 220 stocks, up from just 180 names at the start of the year. In a radio interview with Chuck Jaffe, MarketWatch senior columnist, Auer noted that investors looking at stocks from the bottom up should not shy away from good small companies -- at a time when the market seems to favor large-caps -- even if that means going down to Pink Sheets companies to find them. Auer's fund AUERX, +1.59% is just a few months old, but his firm has used its current system on private funds for years, looking for stocks that have at least 25% year-over-year earnings growth and revenue growth of 20%, and then looking for a combined price/earnings ratio -- representing trailing, forward and current P/E -- of 12 or less to make sure he's getting those stocks on the cheap. He said that investors should not let small size scare them away from a stock, pointing instead to the balance sheet. He said that his fund researches more than 9,000 stocks and buys everything which meets the strict criteria, from giant names to the smallest offerings. ""We're focused on the numbers for the company,"" Auer said, ""not the market or the cap size or the sector."" Further proving that willingness to go anywhere, Auer talked about several microcap stocks, putting buy recommendations on Art's-Way Technologies ARTW, +6.25% and Netsol Technologies NTWK, -1.09% a hold recommendation on Ocean Bio-Chem OBCI, -1.94% and avoid/sell recommendations on Biopure BPUR and FreightCar America RAIL, -0.60% In another interview, Gregg Brewer, executive director of research at Value Line, said that nervous investors may want to look at municipal bonds for yield right now, noting that tax-equivalent yields are currently outpacing inflation, something savers are having a hard time finding elsewhere.

Rotech, an Orlando, Fla.-based provider of medical equipment, said it disagrees with the FDA's assertions, but plans to immediately begin to switch patients currently taking to compounded products to drug products that are commercially available. In addition, the company said it won't accept any new prescriptions for the products. Rotech estimated that the process of switching about 30,000 patients to commercially available drug products will take several months to complete. Safeguard Scientifics SFE, +0.00% shares added 11% after the company said it would sell its Mantas unit to i-Flex for $122.6 million. Safeguard expects to report a gain on the transaction of approximately $82 million when it closes. Sonic Corp. SONC, +0.16% gained 9.8% after saying its board approved a modified Dutch auction tender offer to purchase as many as 25.5 million shares for a maximum of $560 million, or $19.50 to $22 a share. U.S. Lec Corp. CLEC shares added 12% after the company said it was buying privately-held Paetec in a stock swap deal valued at $1.3 billion. Separately, U.S. Lec said its quarterly loss narrowed to $7.57 million, or 25 cents a share, from $8.95 million, or 30 cents a share, as revenue rose 12% to $107 million. The company cited strong new customer growth, strong sales into its base of approximately 28,000 business class customers and continued customer loyalty for the narrowing of the loss. It added it's settled its carrier access revenue dispute with Qwest Communications and doesn't expect any more charges above that disclosed its Form 10-K for 2005. Valspar Corp. VAL, +0.00% rose 6% after it said third-quarter net income rose to $52.6 million, or 51 cents a share from $45.7 million, or 44 cents a share in the same period a year ago. The coatings specialist said current earnings include 1 cent a share in expenses related to its manufacturing rationalization plan and 1 cent a share for stock-expense compensation. They also include a favorable tax adjustment of 3 cents a share. Sales for the quarter ended July 28 rose to $797.4 million from $725.4 million a year ago. The Thomson First Call average estimate was for earnings of 49 cents a share on sales of $787.9 million. On Friday, the stock fell 8 cents to $25.09. Weight Watchers International, Inc. WTW, +0.88% shares gained 7.5% after J.P. Morgan upgraded the company to overweight from neutral, citing the 29% pullback in the shares since February. The broker told clients it now believes sentiment has become too negative and that positive factors include an increasing contribution from the group's licensing and .com businesses. In addition, J.P. Morgan said it expects Weight Watchers' more aggressive pricing focus to continue. Whole Foods Market WFMI moved 7.5% higher after J.P. Morgan upgraded the organic foods grocer to neutral from underweight, citing market expectations for earnings per share. In addition, the broker told clients that the retailer's addressable market seems to extend further into the $480 billion traditional food retail market than where Whole Foods currently stands. Decliners Calgon Carbon Corp. CCC, +13.75% fell 27% Monday after the air and water purifier said it was planning to sell $65 million in convertible debt. CV Therapeutics, Inc. CVTX slumped 10% after it said Monday it is offering 7.5 million common shares in a public offering. All of the shares are being offered by CV. Lehman Brothers Inc. and Merrill Lynch & Co. are acting as joint lead managers and joint bookrunners of the public offering. Harvey Electronics Ltd., HRVE tumbled 16% after the Lyndhurst, N.J., retailer, said it expects to report a wider third-quarter loss. Third-quarter sales dropped 16% to $7.6 million while comparable- store sales fell 19%. Natural Health Trends Corp. BHIP, -2.75% dropped 18% after reporting late Friday wider second-quarter losses and a decline in revenue. The company blamed the lower sales on hesitation among its Hong Kong-registered members given the uncertain regulatory environment in China. Ocean Bio-Chem Inc. OBCI, -1.94% shares lost 17% after the company reported a second-quarter net loss of $213,236, or 3 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $316,227, or 6 cents a share, during the year-ago period.

OBCI,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. Overview: We are engaged in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of a broad line of appearance, performance, and maintenance products for the marine, automotive, power sports, recreational vehicle and outdoor power equipment markets, under the Star brite(R) and other trademarks within the United States and Canada. In addition, we produce private label formulations of many of our products for various customers and provide custom blending and packaging services for these and other products. We also manufacture, market and distribute a line of products including disinfectants, sanitizers and deodorizers. We sell our products through national retailers and to national and regional distributors. In addition, we sell products to two companies affiliated with Peter G. Dornau, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; these companies distribute the products outside of the United States and Canada. Transactions with the affiliated companies were made in the ordinary course of business, and management believes that sales to the affiliated companies do not involve more than normal credit risk. We are nearing completion of the Expansion Project, which involves the expansion of Kinpak's manufacturing and warehouse facilities in Montgomery, Alabama. See ""Business - Recent Developments"" in Item 1 of this report for additional information. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted on December 22, 2017, changes United States tax law significantly. The most important change affecting Ocean Bio-Chem, Inc. is the reduction in the United States corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018. Among other things, the reduction in the corporate tax rate resulted in a substantial decrease in our deferred tax liabilities, which is discussed in more detail below under ""Results of Operations - Provision for income taxes."" Our operating results for 2016 were adversely affected by professional fees and expenses related to litigation against a competitor in which we and the competitor each claimed that the other was engaged in false advertising and related violations of law (the ""Advertising Litigation""). Following a trial in which it was determined that neither party was liable to the other, the Advertising Litigation was concluded. Our professional fees and expenses related to the Advertising Litigation were approximately $1,146,000 in 2016. As the Advertising Litigation was concluded in 2016, we had no expenses related to the Advertising Litigation during 2017. Critical accounting estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. We have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and, if subject to different assumptions and conditions, could lead to materially different results. Collectability of trade accounts receivable In the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our unaffiliated customers on terms that range from 30 to 180 days. In an effort to reduce our credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and aging of receivables, as well as our customers' creditworthiness, as determined by our review of their current credit information. We generally do not require collateral on trade accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on expected collectability of the trade accounts receivable, after considering our historical collection experience, the length of time an account is outstanding, the financial position of the customer if known and information provided by credit rating services. The adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $79,000 and $75,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, which was approximately 1.6% and 1.5% of gross accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in increased uncertainty as to their ability to make payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur, we may be required to increase the allowance or incur a bad debt expense. In this regard, we incurred a bad debt expense of approximately $199,000 in 2017, most of which resulted from a customer's bankruptcy. Inventories Our inventories primarily are composed of raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, using the first-in, first-out method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. We maintain a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory to reflect the diminution in value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated net realizable value. The adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. In assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Our slow moving and obsolete inventory reserve was $274,295 and $268,159 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income taxes We account for income taxes under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates, which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. The differences are attributable to differing methods of financial statement and income tax treatment with respect to depreciation and reserves for trade accounts receivable and inventories. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on, among other factors, changes in tax law, future taxable income and settlements with tax authorities. In this regard, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act resulted in a meaningful reduction in our net deferred tax liability as of December 31, 2017, reflecting the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act's reduction of the United States corporate income tax rate. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. We record a valuation allowance when necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the net amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized. We consider available evidence, both positive and negative, and use judgments regarding past and future events, including operating results and available tax planning strategies, in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries are examined by various federal and state tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate such an adjustment. The ultimate outcomes of the examinations of our income tax returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are acquired assets that lack physical substance and that meet specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. Our intangible assets include trademarks, tradenames, patents and royalty rights. We own several trademarks and trade names, including Star brite(R) and Performacide(R). We have determined that these intangible assets have indefinite lives and, therefore, are not amortized. In addition, we own several patents, the most significant of which are the ClO2 Patents, which relate to a device for producing chlorine dioxide that is incorporated in our deodorizer, sanitizer and disinfectant products. We amortize our patents over their remaining life on a straight line basis; amortization expense related to the ClO2 patents was approximately $52,000 ($51,000 for ClO2 patents and $1,000 for other patents) for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. In 2013, we acquired royalty rights relating to sales of products encompassing the ClO2 Patents' technology (we purchased these rights from an unaffiliated entity that previously owned the ClO2 Patents and retained the royalty rights after selling the patents). We are amortizing the royalty rights over their remaining life on a straight line basis; amortization expense relating to the royalty rights was approximately $18,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. See Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. We evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks and trade names) for impairment annually and at other times if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In evaluating our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than the carrying value, we would then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying amounts. In 2017, we performed a qualitative assessment on all of our indefinite lived assets and determined, based on the assessment, that their fair values were more likely than not higher than their carrying values. We assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of intangible assets having finite lives (patents and royalty rights) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events or circumstances may include, for example, the occurrence of an adverse change with respect to a product line that utilizes the intangible assets. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such an event or circumstance has occurred. Any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Results of Operations: The following table provides a summary of our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:  For The Years Ended December 31, Percent Percentage of Net Sales 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Net sales $ 38,933,458 $ 36,205,444 7.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 24,436,780 22,331,761 9.4 % 62.8 % 61.7 % Gross profit 14,496,678 13,873,683 4.5 % 37.2 % 38.3 % Advertising and promotion 3,523,710 3,117,164 13.0 % 9.1 % 8.6 % Selling and administrative 7,297,538 7,660,377 (4.7 )% 18.7 % 21.2 % Operating income 3,675,430 3,096,142 18.7 % 9.4 % 8.6 % Interest income (expense), net 2,065 (17,820 ) (111.6 )% 0.0 % 0.0 % Provision for income taxes (1,073,961 ) (983,151 ) 9.2 % 2.8 % 2.7 % Net income $ 2,603,534 $ 2,095,171 24.3 % 6.7 % 5.8 %  Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by approximately $2,728,000 or 7.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The net sales increase principally is attributable to sales of our marine products to two of our largest customers. In addition, we experienced sales growth generally with respect to a wide range of customers, including mass merchandisers, large home improvement and marine/sports retail chains, and online retailers. Cost of goods sold increased by approximately $2,105,000 or 9.4% in 2017, as compared to 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold is principally a result of increased sales volume, higher raw material costs on our winterizing products and higher manufacturing costs. Gross profit increased by approximately $623,000 or 4.5% during 2017, as compared to 2016. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit decreased to 37.2% in 2017 from 38.3% in 2016. The increase in gross profit in 2017 is primarily attributable to increased sales volume. The decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales during 2017 is principally a result of lower profit margins on sales of our winterizing products due to both lower sales prices and higher raw material costs. Advertising and promotion expense increased by approximately $407,000 or 13.0% during 2017, as compared to 2016. As a percentage of net sales, advertising and promotion expense increased to 9.1% in 2017 compared to 8.6% in 2016. The increase in advertising and promotion expense is primarily a result of increases in customer cooperative advertising allowances provided to select customers and other marketing expenses. Selling and administrative expenses decreased by approximately $363,000 or 4.7%, during 2017, as compared to 2016. The decrease reflects the conclusion of the Advertising Litigation in 2016. In 2016, legal fees and expenses related to the Advertising Litigation were approximately $1,146,000. This decrease was partially offset by increased employee compensation expenses (including salaries, commissions and stock awards); bad debt expense of approximately $199,000, of which approximately $188,000 resulted from a customer's bankruptcy; and increased costs of computer programming and other information technology services. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses decreased to 18.7 % in 2017 from 21.2% in 2016. Interest income, net for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $2,000; for the year ended December 31, 2016, interest expense, net was approximately $18,000. Interest income in 2017 was generated principally by an escrow account in which a portion of the funds relating to an industrial development bond financing were deposited pending our utilization of such funds in connection with the Expansion Project. The interest income was offset principally by interest under an earlier term loan that matured on July 6, 2017; we paid all remaining principal and interest on the maturity date. The term loan also was the source of our primary interest obligation in 2016. Provision for income taxes increased by approximately $91,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, or 29.2% of our pretax income, compared to approximately $983,000 in the year ended December 31, 2016, or 31.9% of our pretax income. The increase in our provision for income taxes, which principally was due to the increase in our operating income, was offset in part by the benefit reflecting the reduction of our U.S. corporate income tax rate from 34% to 21% under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We revalued our net deferred tax liabilities to give effect to the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, which resulted in an approximately $91,000 tax benefit. For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our cash balance was approximately $2,418,000 at December 31, 2017 compared to approximately $4,070,000 at December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:  Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 2,928,277 $ 3,025,585 Net cash used in investing activities (8,023,092 ) (443,892 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities 3,442,826 (978,503 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash 28 (1,160 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash $ (1,651,961 ) $ 1,602,030  Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 decreased by approximately $97,000 or 3.2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The comparative decrease is attributable to changes in working capital (excluding cash) of approximately $1,099,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to changes of approximately $344,000 during the year ended December 31, 2016. These changes were mostly offset by an increase in net income of approximately $508,000 combined with an increase of noncash expenses of approximately $158,000 during the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. Inventories, net were approximately $9,074,000 and $8,601,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $473,000 or 5.5% in 2017. The 2017 increase in inventories reflects anticipated demand in the first quarter of 2018. Net trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2017 aggregated approximately $4,964,000, an increase of approximately $32,000 or 0.7% compared to approximately $4,932,000 in net trade accounts receivable outstanding at December 31, 2016. Receivables due from affiliated companies aggregated approximately $1,584,000 at December 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $394,000, or 33.1% over receivables due from affiliated companies of approximately $1,190,000 at December 31, 2016. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by approximately $7,579,000, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to expenditures related to the Expansion Project and the classification of unused cash proceeds of an industrial development bond financing with respect to the Expansion Project as restricted cash. The classification results from a lease agreement that places limitations on our use of cash we received from the industrial development bond financing. See ""Overview"" above and Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information. Net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was approximately $3,400,000 compared to net cash used of approximately $979,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we received proceeds of $4,500,000 from the industrial development bond financing relating to the Expansion Project and had lower payments on long term debt because a term loan that had been outstanding since 2011 matured on July 6, 2017, at which date we repaid all outstanding principal and interest. These increases to cash were partially offset by payments for debt issuance costs. See Notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information concerning our principal credit facilities, consisting of Kinpak's obligations relating to an industrial development bond financing, the payment of which we have guaranteed and a revolving line of credit. At December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had outstanding balances of approximately $4,463,000 and $260,000, under Kinpak's obligations relating to the industrial development bond financing and a previously outstanding term loan respectively, and no borrowings under our current and previous revolving credit facilities.The loan agreement pertaining to our revolving line of credit, as amended, contains various covenants, including financial covenants requiring a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio (generally, the ratio of (A) EBITDA for the four most recently completed fiscal quarters minus the sum of Company's distributions to its shareholders, taxes paid and unfunded capital expenditures during such period to (B) current maturities of Company long-term debt (as defined) as of the end of the most recent fiscal quarter plus scheduled interest expense incurred over the most recently completed four fiscal quarters) of 1.20 to 1, tested quarterly and a maximum ""debt to cap"" ratio (generally, funded debt divided by the sum of net worth and funded debt) of 0.75 to 1 as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The agreement relating to the revolving line of credit generally defines ""long term debt"" as ""debt instruments with a maturity principal due date of one year or more in length,"" including, among other listed contractual debt instruments, ""revolving lines of credit"" and ""capital leases obligations."" Our guarantee of Kinpak's obligations related to the industrial development bond financing effectively is subject to substantially the same financial covenants. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's fixed charge coverage ratio was approximately 7.30 to 1.00, and at December 31, 2017, the Company's debt to capitalization ratio was approximately 0.15 to 1.00. In addition to the industrial revenue bond financing and the revolving line of credit, we have obtained financing through capital leases for office equipment, totaling approximately $50,000 and $69,000 at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Some of our assets and liabilities are denominated in Canadian dollars and are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations. We do not engage in currency hedging and address currency risk as a pricing issue. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded $1,496 in foreign currency translation adjustments (decreasing shareholders' equity by $1,496). During the past few years, we have introduced a number of new products. At times, new product introductions have required us to increase our overall inventory and have resulted in lower inventory turnover rates. The effects of reduced inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations. We believe that all capital required to fund any inventory increases will continue to be provided by operations and, if necessary, our current revolving line of credit or a renewal or replacement of the facility. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to secure such a renewal or replacement of our revolving line of credit. Many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are petroleum or chemical based and commodity chemicals that are subject to fluctuating prices. The nature of our business does not enable us to pass through the price increases to our national retailer customers and to our distributors as promptly as we experience increases in raw material costs. This may, at times, adversely affect our margins. As noted above, we are in the final stages of the Expansion Project, which entails an approximately 85,000 square feet addition to Kinpak's manufacturing facilities and an expansion of Kinpak's outdoor tank farm to accommodate an additional 500,000 gallons in tank capacity. The addition to the facilities and expansion of the tank farm are completed. The remaining parts of the Expansion Project involve additional upgrades to the warehouse facilities and the installation of new manufacturing equipment. At December 31, 2017, expenditures in connection with the Expansion Project aggregated approximately $5.1 million, and we estimate that the total cost of the Expansion Project will be approximately $6.0 million. The Expansion Project is expected to be completed and placed into service during 2018. The Expansion Project is being financed primarily with the proceeds of the industrial development bond financing, which is described in Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. The Expansion Project also is being funded with cash from operations. We believe that funds provided through operations and other sources of financing will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over at least the next twelve months.

OBCI,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-looking Statements: Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including without limitation, estimated costs of expansion of facilities operated by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Kinpak Inc. (""Kinpak""), anticipated demand in the second quarter of 2017, our projected income tax rate for the full 2017 year, our ability to provide required capital to support inventory levels, the effect of price increases in raw materials that are petroleum or chemical based or commodity chemicals on our margins, our ability to negotiate a suitable loan facility to finance the cost of a project to expand Kinpak's manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities in Montgomery, Alabama, and the sufficiency of funds provided through operations and existing sources of financing to satisfy our cash requirements constitute forward-looking statements. For this purpose, any statements contained in this report that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, words such as ""believe,"" ""may,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" or ""could,"" including the negative or other variations thereof or comparable terminology, are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results to be materially different from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Factors that may affect these results include, but are not limited to, the highly competitive nature of our industry; reliance on certain key customers; changes in consumer demand for marine, recreational vehicle and automotive products; advertising and promotional efforts; unanticipated litigation developments; exposure to market risks relating to changes in interest rates, foreign exchange rates, prices for raw materials that are petroleum or chemical based and other factors addressed in Part I, Item 1A (""Risk Factors"") in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Overview: We are engaged in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of a broad line of appearance, performance, and maintenance products for the marine, automotive, power sports, recreational vehicle and outdoor power equipment markets, under the Star brite(R) and other trademarks within the United States and Canada. In addition, we produce private label formulations of many of our products for various customers and provide custom blending and packaging services for these and other products. We also manufacture, market and distribute a line of products including disinfectants, sanitizers and deodorizers. We sell our products through national retailers and to national and regional distributors. In addition, we sell products to two companies affiliated with Peter G. Dornau, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; these companies distribute the products outside of the United States and Canada. Transactions with the affiliated companies were made in the ordinary course of business. While the terms of the sales to the affiliated companies differed from the terms of sale to other customers, the affiliated companies bear their own warehousing, distribution, advertising, selling and marketing costs, as well as their own freight charges (we pay freight charges in connection with sales to our domestic customers on all but small orders). Moreover, we do not pay sales commissions with respect to products sold to the affiliated companies. As a result, we believe our profit margins with respect to sales of our products to the affiliated companies are similar to the profit margins we realize with respect to sales of the same products to our larger domestic customers. Management believes that the sales to the affiliated companies did not involve more than normal credit risk or present other unfavorable features. We have commenced an expansion of Kinpak's manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities in Montgomery, Alabama. As currently contemplated, the project will entail an approximately 85,000 square feet addition to the facilities and an expansion of Kinpak's outdoor blended tank farm to accommodate an additional 500,000 gallons in tank capacity, thereby doubling the tank farm's current capacity. At March 31, 2017, expenditures in connection with this project aggregated approximately $967,000, and we estimate that the total cost of the project will be approximately $4.7 million. We are currently using internal funds for this project, although we are in negotiations to finance the costs of the entire project. Nevertheless, we cannot assure that such financing will be obtained. See ""Liquidity and Capital Resources,"" below, for a discussion regarding financing of the project. We have commenced an expansion of Kinpak's manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities in Montgomery, Alabama. At March 31, 2017, we have spent in aggregate approximately $967,000, and we estimate that the total cost of the project will be approximately $4.7 million. Our operating results for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were adversely affected by professional fees and expenses related to litigation against a competitor in which we and the competitor each claimed that the other was engaged in false advertising and related violations of law (the ""Advertising Litigation""). Following a trial in which it was determined that neither party was liable to the other, the Advertising Litigation was concluded. Accordingly, we did not have any expenses related to the Advertising Litigation for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Our professional fees and expenses related to the Advertising Litigation for the three months ended March 31, 2016 were approximately $1,085,000. Critical accounting estimates: See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates"" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 for information regarding our critical accounting estimates. Results of Operations: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to the Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 The following table provides a summary of our financial results for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:  For The Three Months Ended March 31, Percent Percentage of Net Sales 2017 2016 Change 2017 2016 Net sales $ 8,391,979 $ 6,750,080 24.3 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 5,257,262 4,368,137 20.4 % 62.6 % 64.7 % Gross profit 3,134,717 2,381,943 31.6 % 37.4 % 35.3 % Advertising and promotion 848,358 715,872 18.5 % 10.1 % 10.6 % Selling and administrative 1,544,023 2,485,863 (37.9 )% 18.4 % 36.8 % Operating income (loss) 742,336 (819,792 ) 190.6 8.8 % 12.1 % Interest (expense), net (1,948 ) (5,884 ) (66.9 )% 0.0 % 0.1 % Income tax (provision) benefit (236,464 ) 284,874 183.0 % 2.8 % 4.2 % Net income (loss) $ 503,924 $ (540,802 ) 193.2 % 6.0 % 8.0 %  Net sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by approximately $1,642,000, or 24.3%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in net sales is principally a result of increases in sales of our marine, automotive and our Outdoor Collection products, reflecting to a significant extent, sales of our marine products to a large national retailer. Cost of goods sold increased by approximately $889,000, or 20.4%, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold is a result of higher sales volume. Gross profit increased by approximately $753,000, or 31.6%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. Gross profit increased due to increased sales volume and because some of our costs are fixed cost we realized increased efficiencies at our manufacturing plant. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit was approximately 37.4% and 35.3% for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Advertising and promotion expenses increased by approximately $132,000, or 18.5%, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. As a percentage of net sales, advertising and promotion expense was approximately 10.1% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to approximately 10.6% for the same period in 2016. The increase is principally a result of increased customer cooperative advertising allowances provided to select customers and charter boat services used for entertainment of Company customers, which is discussed in Note 8 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report. Selling and administrative expensesdecreased by approximately $942,000, or 37.9%, during the three months ending March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease reflects the conclusion of the Advertising Litigation in 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, legal fees and expenses related to the Advertising Litigation were approximately $1,085,000. The decrease in selling and administrative expenses relating to the Advertising Litigation was partially offset by increases in salaries and professional services. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses decreased to 18.4% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to 36.8% for the same period in 2016. Interest expense, net decreased by approximately $4,000 or 66.9%, for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the same period in 2016. The decrease reflects the declining principal balance outstanding on our term loan. Income tax (provision) benefit - Our income tax provision for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was approximately $236,000, or 31.9% of our pretax income, compared to an income tax benefit of approximately $285,000, or 34.5% of pretax income, for the same period in 2016. The 2017 tax rate reflects our projected rate for the full year of 2017, which is consistent with our tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2016. Liquidity and capital resources: Our cash balance was approximately $3,399,000 at March 31, 2017 compared to approximately $4,070,000 at December 31, 2016. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 362,855 $ 137,878 Net cash used in investing activities (904,552 ) (76,494 ) Net cash used in financing activities (116,819 ) (91,266 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash (12,817 ) (2,455 ) Net decrease in cash $ (671,333 ) $ (32,337 )  Net cash provided by operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by approximately $225,000 or 163.2%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The comparative increase in cash provided by operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017 is principally a result of our increase in net income. The Company also had increases of approximately $71,000 in noncash expenses during the 2017 period. These increases were partially offset by net changes in working capital (excluding cash) of approximately $891,000 as compared to the same period in 2016. Net trade accounts receivable at March 31, 2017 aggregated approximately $4,779,000, a decrease of approximately $153,000 or 3.1% compared to approximately $4,932,000 in net trade accounts receivable outstanding at December 31, 2016. Receivables due from affiliated companies aggregated approximately $1,816,000 at March 31, 2017, an increase of approximately $626,000, or 52.6% over receivables due from affiliated companies of approximately $1,190,000 at December 31, 2016. The increase in receivables due from affiliated companies is, in part, due to sales in the first quarter of 2017. Inventories, net were approximately $10,166,000 and $8,601,000 at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $1,565,000 or 18.2% during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The 2017 increase in inventories reflects anticipated demand in the second quarter of 2017. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by approximately $828,000 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase is primarily attributable to the expenditures related to the expansion of Kinpak's manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities in Montgomery, Alabama. See ""Overview"" above for additional information. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased by approximately $26,000, or 28.0%, as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. While net cash used in financing activities for both periods reflect repayments under our term loan, the 2016 period reflects the partially offsetting effect of our receipt of $21,600 as a result of the exercise of stock options. See Notes 6 and 7 to the condensed consolidated financial statements included in this report for information concerning our principal credit facilities, consisting of a revolving line of credit and a term loan. At March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit and outstanding balances of approximately $149,000 and $260,000, respectively, under our term loan. The loan agreement related to our revolving line of credit contains various covenants, including financial covenants requiring a minimum debt coverage ratio (generally, net operating profit plus depreciation, amortization and rent/lease expense divided by current maturities of long-term debt plus interest and rent/lease expense) of 1.75 to 1.00, calculated on a trailing twelve month basis, and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio In addition to the revolving line of credit and term loan, we have obtained financing through capital leases for office equipment, totaling approximately $63,000 and $69,000 at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. Some of our assets and liabilities are in the Canadian dollars and are subject to currency fluctuations relating to the Canadian dollar. We do not engage in currency hedging and address currency risk as a pricing issue. In the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded approximately $2,000 in foreign currency translation adjustments (decreasing shareholders' equity by $2,000). During the past few years, we have introduced a number of new products. At times, new product introductions have required us to increase our overall inventory and have resulted in lower inventory turnover rates. The effects of reduced inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations. We believe that all required capital to maintain such increases will continue to be provided by operations and, if necessary, our current revolving line of credit or a renewal or replacement of the facility. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to secure such a renewal or replacement of our revolving line of credit. Many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are petroleum or chemical based and commodity chemicals that are subject to fluctuating prices. The nature of our business does not enable us to pass through the price increases to our national retailer customers and to our distributors as promptly as we experience increases in raw material costs. This may, at times, adversely affect our margins. See ""Overview"" above for a description of expenditures relating to a project to expand Kinpak's manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities in Montgomery, Alabama. As noted above, we are in negotiations to finance the cost of the entire project. While we believe that we will be able to obtain a suitable loan facility from a lending institution, we cannot assure that our negotiations will be successful. In the event that we are not able to obtain a suitable facility, we anticipate that we will incur borrowings under our revolving line of credit, although that facility expires on August 31, 2017, and we intend to seek an extension of the revolving line of credit from our principal lending bank. If we are unable to borrow sufficient funds to finance the expansion project, we may delay some components of the project. Subject to the matters discussed in the preceding paragraph, we believe that funds provided through operations and our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over at least the next twelve months.

OBCI,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements contained in Item 8 of this report. Overview: We are engaged in the manufacture, marketing and distribution of a broad line of appearance, performance, and maintenance products for the marine, automotive, power sports, recreational vehicle and outdoor power equipment markets, under the Star brite(R) and other trademarks within the United States and Canada. In addition, we produce private label formulations of many of our products for various customers and provide custom blending and packaging services for these and other products. We also manufacture, market and distribute a line of products including disinfectants, sanitizers and deodorizers. We sell our products through national retailers and to national and regional distributors. In addition, we sell products to two companies affiliated with Peter G. Dornau, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; these companies distribute the products outside of the United States and Canada. Transactions with the affiliated companies were made in the ordinary course of business. While the terms of the sales to the affiliated companies differed from the terms of sale to other customers, the affiliated companies bear their own warehousing, distribution, advertising, selling and marketing costs, as well as their own freight charges (the Company pays freight charges in connection with sales to its domestic customers on all but small orders). Moreover, the Company does not pay sales commissions with respect to products sold to the affiliated companies. As a result, the Company believes its profit margins with respect to sales of its products to the affiliated companies are similar to the profit margins it realizes with respect to sales of the same products to its larger domestic customers. Management believes that the sales to the affiliated companies did not involve more than normal credit risk or present other unfavorable features. We have commenced an expansion of Kinpak's manufacturing and warehouse facilities in Montgomery, Alabama. See ""Business - Recent Developments"" in Item 1 of this report. Our operating results for 2016 and 2015 were adversely affected by professional fees and expenses related to litigation against a competitor in which we and the competitor each claimed that the other was engaged in false advertising and related violations of law (the ""Advertising Litigation""). Following a trial in which it was determined that neither party was liable to the other, the Advertising Litigation was concluded. Our professional fees and expenses related to the Advertising Litigation were approximately $1,146,000 in 2016 and $1,174,000 in 2015. Critical accounting estimates: The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions. We have identified the following as critical accounting estimates, which are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties, are the most pervasive and important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and, if subject to different assumptions and conditions, could lead to materially different results. Revenue recognition and collectability of trade accounts receivable Revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of a contract exists, the sales price is fixed and determinable, the title of goods pass to the customer, and collectability of the related receivable is probable. With respect to a customer for whom the Company manages the inventory at the customer's location, revenue is recognized when the products are sold to a third party. In the ordinary course of business, we grant non-interest bearing trade credit to our customers on normal credit terms. In an effort to reduce our credit risk, we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and customers' creditworthiness, as determined by our review of their current credit information. We monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical experience, specific customer collection issues and reviews of agings of trade receivables based on contractual terms. We generally do not require collateral on trade accounts receivable. We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our historical collection experience and expected collectability of the trade accounts receivable, considering the period the trade accounts receivable are outstanding, the financial position of the customer and information provided by credit rating services. The adequacy of this allowance is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately $75,000 and $78,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, which was approximately 1.5% of gross accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 and 2015. If the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate, resulting in increased uncertainty as to their ability to make payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur, we may be required to increase the allowance. Inventories Inventories primarily are composed of raw materials and finished goods and are stated at the lower of cost or market, using the first-in, first-out method. We maintain a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory to reflect the diminution in value resulting from product obsolescence, damage or other issues affecting marketability in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value. The adequacy of this reserve is reviewed each reporting period and adjusted as necessary. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. In assessing historical usage, we also qualitatively assess business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Our slow moving and obsolete inventory reserve was $268,159 and $279,882 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Income taxes Income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized to reflect the future tax consequences attributable to the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using currently enacted tax rates, which we expect will apply to taxable income in the years in which the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases are recovered or settled. The differences are attributable to differing methods of financial statement and income tax treatment with respect to depreciation and reserves for trade accounts receivable and inventories. The likelihood of a material change in our expected realization of deferred tax assets is dependent on, among other factors, changes in tax law, future taxable income and settlements with tax authorities. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may require future adjustments to our tax assets and liabilities, which could be material. In assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets, we evaluate positive and negative evidence and use judgments regarding past and future events, including operating results and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets. Based on this assessment, we determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized, in which case we would apply a valuation allowance, in an amount equal to future tax benefits that may not be realized, to offset our deferred tax assets. We currently do not apply a valuation allowance to our deferred tax assets. However, if facts and circumstances change in the future, a valuation allowance may be required. Significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and in evaluating tax positions. We establish additional provisions for income taxes when, despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable, there remain certain positions that do not meet the minimum probability threshold, which is a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority. In the normal course of business, we and our subsidiaries are examined by various federal and state tax authorities. We regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes. We adjust the income tax provision, the current tax liability and deferred taxes in any period in which we become aware of facts that necessitate such an adjustment. The ultimate outcomes of the examinations of our income tax returns could result in increases or decreases to our recorded tax liabilities, which would affect our financial results. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are acquired assets that lack physical substance and that meet specified criteria for recognition apart from goodwill. Our intangible assets include trademarks, tradenames, patents and royalty rights. We own several trademarks and trade names, including Star brite(R), and Performacide(R). We have determined that these intangible assets have indefinite lives and, therefore, are not amortized. In addition, we own several patents, the most significant of which are the ClO2 Patents, which relate to a device for producing chlorine dioxide that is incorporated in our deodorizer, sanitizer and disinfectant products. We amortize our patents over their remaining life on a straight line basis; amortization expense related to these patents was approximately $51,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. In 2013, we acquired royalty rights relating to sales of products encompassing the ClO2 Patents' technology (we purchased these rights from an unaffiliated entity that previously owned the ClO2 Patents and retained the royalty rights after selling the patents). We are amortizing the royalty rights over their remaining life on a straight line basis; amortization expense relating to the royalty rights was approximately $18,000 for each of the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015. We evaluate our indefinite-lived intangible assets (trademarks and trade names) for impairment annually and at other times if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may have occurred. In evaluating our indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying value. If, after completing the qualitative assessment, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset is greater than its carrying amount, the asset is not impaired. If we conclude it is more likely than not that the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than the carrying value, we would then proceed to a quantitative impairment test, which consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible assets to their carrying amounts. In 2016, we performed a qualitative assessment on all of our indefinite lived assets and determined, based on the assessment, that their fair values were more likely than not higher than their carrying values. We assess the remaining useful life and recoverability of intangible assets having finite lives (patents and royalty rights) whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. Such events may include, for example, the occurrence of an adverse change with respect to a product line that utilizes the intangible assets. Significant judgments in this area involve determining whether such an event has occurred. Any impairment loss, if indicated, equals the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the estimated fair value of the asset. Results of Operations: The following table provides a summary of our financial results for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:  For The Years Ended December 31, Percent Percentage of Net Sales 2016 2015 Change 2016 2015 Net sales $ 36,205,444 $ 33,987,487 6.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold 22,331,761 22,647,516 (1.4 )% 61.7 % 66.6 % Gross profit 13,873,683 11,339,971 22.3 % 38.3 % 33.4 % Advertising and promotion 3,117,164 3,010,758 3.5 % 8.6 % 8.9 % Selling and administrative 7,660,377 7,579,682 1.1 % 21.2 % 22.3 % Operating income 3,096,142 749,531 313.1 % 8.6 % 2.2 % Interest (expense), net (17,820 ) (33,639 ) (47.0 )% 0.0 % 0.1 % Other (expense) --- (12,522 ) N/A 0.0 % 0.0 % Provision for income taxes (983,151 ) (242,676 ) 305.1 % 2.7 % 0.7 % Net income $ 2,095,171 $ 460,694 354.8 % 5.8 % 1.4 %  Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $2,218,000 or 6.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase principally is a result of increased sales of Star brite(R) branded marine products to both retailers and wholesale distributors of our products. In particular, we believe that the increased sales reflect the benefit of the inclusion of our products in more of our large national ""brick and mortar"" retail chain customers' locations, as well as the provision of increased shelf space for our products by these customers. In addition, our sales to online retailers also increased as a result of higher consumer demand. Cost of goods sold decreased by approximately $316,000 or 1.4% in 2016, as compared to 2015. The decrease in cost of goods sold despite the increase in net sales reflects the more favorable product mix resulting from increased sales of Star brite(R) branded marine products. Gross profit increased by approximately $2,534,000 or 22.3% during 2016, as compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, gross profit increased to 38.3% in 2016 from 33.4% in 2015. The increases in gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of net sales is a result of the more favorable product mix discussed above. Advertising and promotion expense increased by approximately $106,000 or 3.5% during 2016, as compared to 2015. As a percentage of net sales, advertising and promotion expense decreased to 8.6% in 2016 compared to 8.9% in 2015. The gross increase in advertising and promotion expense is primarily a result of a $176,000 increase in customer cooperative advertising partially offset by a $66,000 decrease in other marketing expenses. Selling and administrative expenses increased by approximately $81,000 or 1.1%, during 2016, as compared to 2015, reflecting an increase in noncash stock based compensation expense of approximately $131,000. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of approximately $28,000 in legal fees and expenses related to the Advertising Litigation; such fees and expenses were approximately $1,146,000 and $1,174,000 during 2016 and 2015, respectively. The Company expects selling and administrative expenses to decline substantially in 2017 as a result of the conclusion of the Advertising Litigation during 2016. As a percentage of net sales, selling and administrative expenses decreased to 21.2 % in 2016 from 22.3% in 2015. Interest expense, net decreased by approximately $16,000 or 47.0% in 2016, as compared to 2015. The decrease reflects the declining principal outstanding under our term loan. Provision for income taxes - Our provision for income taxes for 2016 was approximately $983,000, or 31.9% of our pretax income, compared to approximately $243,000 in 2015 or 34.5% of pretax income. Our lower tax rate in 2016 is attributable primarily to an increased benefit with respect to a domestic production activities deduction. For additional information, see Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Liquidity and Capital Resources: Our cash balance was approximately $4,070,000 at December 31, 2016 compared to approximately $2,468,000 at December 31, 2015. The following table summarizes our cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015:  Years Ended December 31, 2016 2015 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 3,025,585 $ 812,463 Net cash used in investing activities (443,892 ) (954,663 ) Net cash used in financing activities (978,503 ) (450,598 ) Effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash (1,160 ) (1,516 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash $ 1,602,030 $ (594,314 )  Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $2,213,000 or 272.4%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The comparative increase in cash provided by operating activities during the year ended December 31, 2016 is attributable to an increase in net income of approximately $1,634,000 increased noncash expenses of approximately $61,000, and net favorable changes in working capital (excluding cash) of $517,000 as compared to the same period in 2015. Inventories, net were approximately $8,601,000 and $7,915,000 at December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing an increase of approximately $686,000 or 8.7% in 2016. The 2016 increase in inventories reflects anticipated demand in the first quarter of 2017. Moreover, inventory levels at December 31, 2015 reflect the shipment of a large order a major customer in late December 2016. Net trade accounts receivable at December 31, 2016 aggregated approximately $4,932,000, a decrease of approximately $160,000 or 3.1% compared to approximately $5,092,000 in net trade accounts receivable outstanding at December 31, 2015. Receivables due from affiliated companies aggregated approximately $1,190,000 at December 31, 2016, an increase of approximately $139,000, or 13.2% over receivables due from affiliated companies of approximately $1,051,000 at December 31, 2015. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 decreased by approximately $511,000 or 53.5%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. Our purchases of property, plant and equipment during 2016, principally consisting of manufacturing equipment, was considerably below the level of such purchases in 2015. Net cash used in investing activities during the year ended December 31, 2015 was offset in small part by cash proceeds of $55,000 from the sale of a recreational vehicle we used for advertising and exhibiting our products at trade shows and other events. Net cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 increased by approximately $528,000, or 117.2%, as compared to the year ended December 31, 2015. The increase in the 2016 period is principally due to our payment of a special cash dividend aggregating approximately $541,000, partially offset by approximately $22,000 we received as a result of the exercise of stock options. See Notes 4 and 6 to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for information concerning our principal credit facilities, consisting of a revolving line of credit and a term loan. At December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had no borrowings under our revolving line of credit and outstanding balances of approximately $260,000 and $692,000, respectively, under our term loan. The loan agreement related to our revolving line of credit contains various covenants, including financial covenants requiring a minimum debt coverage ratio (generally, EBITDAR (net operating profit plus depreciation, amortization and lease/rent expense) divided by current maturities of long-term debt plus interest and lease/rent expense) of 1.75 to 1.00, calculated on a trailing twelve month basis, and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio (generally, funded debt divided by the sum of total net worth and funded debt) of 0.75 to 1, calculated quarterly. At December 31, 2016, our debt coverage ratio was approximately 10.60 to 1.00, and our debt to capitalization ratio was approximately 0.02 to 1.00. In addition to our term loan, we have obtained financing through capital leases for office equipment, totaling approximately $69,000 and $88,000 at December 30, 2016 and December 31, 2015, respectively. Some of our assets and liabilities are denominated in Canadian dollars and are subject to currency rate fluctuations. We do not engage in currency hedging and address currency risk as a pricing issue. In the year ended December 31, 2016, we recorded $2,113 in foreign currency translation adjustments (decreasing shareholders' equity by $2,113). During the past few years, we have introduced a number of new products. At times, new product introductions have required us to increase our overall inventory and have resulted in lower inventory turnover rates. The effects of reduced inventory turnover have not been material to our overall operations. We believe that all capital required to fund any inventory increases will continue to be provided by operations and, if necessary, our current revolving line of credit or a renewal or replacement of the facility. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to secure such a renewal or replacement of our revolving line of credit. Many of the raw materials that we use in the manufacturing process are petroleum or chemical based and commodity chemicals that are subject to fluctuating prices. The nature of our business does not enable us to pass through the price increases to our national retailer customers and to our distributors as promptly as we experience increases in raw material costs. This may, at times, adversely affect our margins. As noted above, the Company is proceeding with a project to expand Kinpak's manufacturing, warehouse and distribution facilities in Montgomery, Alabama. As currently contemplated, the project will entail an approximately 85,000 square feet addition to the facilities and an expansion of Kinpak's outdoor blended tank farm to accommodate an additional 500,000 gallons in tank capacity, thereby doubling the tank farm's current capacity. The first phase of the project, involving expansion of the tank farm, was initiated earlier in 2017. We are using internal funds for this phase, although we currently are in negotiations to finance the costs of the entire project. Nevertheless, we cannot assure that such financing will be obtained. We currently estimate that the project cost will be approximately $4.7 million. We believe that funds provided through operations and other sources of financing will be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements over at least the next twelve months. However, in the event that we are not able to obtain additional financing for our expansion project, completion of the project may be delayed. Mar 31, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.
