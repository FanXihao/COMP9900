OBE,"CALGARY, Mar 20, 2018 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- Obsidian Energy: FrontFour is Risking the Company's Progress OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX - OBE, NYSE - OBE.BC) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") comments on FrontFour Capital Group LLC's (""FrontFour"") intention to nominate four candidates to stand for election at the Company's 2018 Annual General Meeting. Jay Thornton, Chairman of the Obsidian Energy Board of Directors (the ""Board""), commented, ""We are disappointed that after several months of attempting to work constructively with FrontFour, including the addition of Gord Ritchie to the Board at their suggestion, FrontFour has chosen to put its interests ahead of other shareholders at a critical time in the Company's history by starting a costly, time consuming, and distracting proxy fight. Obsidian Energy has a refreshed Board with significant shareholder representation that is committed to value creation in both the short and long term. We recognize that status quo is not an option and have been pursuing attractive commercial opportunities to reward investors. FrontFour's unnecessary agenda only adds undue risk to the execution of these outcomes."" Gordon Ritchie, one of the newest members of the Board stated, ""I am in a position to say the strategic points raised by FrontFour have undergone extensive scrutiny by management and the Board. As communicated to FrontFour and all shareholders, we are aggressively looking at all options to increase shareholder value. This is a challenging investment environment for all Canadian E&P, but I am confident when I say Obsidian Energy is on the right track and David French and his group are the right team to execute."" Obsidian Energy will have more to say on FrontFour's agenda in due course. In the meantime, the Board and management team remain focused on executing our strategic plan to deliver strong results on behalf of all shareholders. Shareholders do not need to take any action at this time regarding voting at the Annual General Meeting. Obsidian Energy shares are listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange under the symbol ""OBE"" and the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""OBE.BC"".

OBE,"CALGARY, Mar 12, 2018 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- Obsidian Energy Receives Continued Listing Standard Notification from the New York Stock Exchange Regarding the Price of its Common Shares OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX/NYSE - OBE) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") announces that it received notification on March 12, 2018 from the New York Stock Exchange (the ""NYSE"") that Obsidian Energy is no longer in compliance with one of the NYSE's continued listing standards because the average closing price of Obsidian Energy's common shares was less than US$1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading day period. As of March 8, 2018, the average closing price of Obsidian Energy's common shares over the preceding consecutive 30 trading day period was US$0.99 per share. The issuance of the notification is not discretionary and is sent automatically when a listed company's share price falls below the NYSE's minimum price listing standard. As described in our press release dated March 7, 2018, Obsidian Energy will propose a consolidation of the Company's outstanding common shares at the upcoming Annual General Meeting. Obsidian Energy believes that a share consolidation will reduce its outstanding equity float to a level more suitable to the current size of the Company and appeal to a broader universe of investors. The proposed consolidation also seeks to remedy our non-compliance with the NYSE's minimum share price listing standard. Under the NYSE's rules, Obsidian Energy can avoid delisting if, within six months from the date of the NYSE notification, its common shares have a closing price on the last trading day of any calendar month and a concurrent 30 trading day average closing price of at least US$1.00 per share. Therefore, the price condition following the proposed consolidation is cured if the common share price promptly exceeds US$1.00 and remains above that level for at least the following 30 trading days. If at the expiration of the applicable cure period Obsidian Energy has not regained compliance, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. Non-compliance with the NYSE's price listing standard does not affect Obsidian Energy's business operations or its reporting requirements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), nor does it breach or cause an event of default under any of Obsidian Energy's agreements with its lenders. Obsidian Energy continues to be in compliance with the terms of all of those agreements. In addition, non-compliance with the NYSE price listing standard does not affect the continued listing and trading of Obsidian Energy's common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange (the ""TSX""). Obsidian Energy intends to notify the NYSE within 10 business days from the date of the notification that it intends to cure this price deficiency and return to compliance with the NYSE's price listing standard prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period. Obsidian Energy's common shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the applicable cure period, subject to compliance with the NYSE's other continued listing standards, under the symbol ""OBE"", but the NYSE will assign a "".BC"" indicator to the symbol to denote that Obsidian Energy is below the NYSE's price listing standard. This indicator will be removed at such time as Obsidian Energy is deemed compliant with the NYSE's price listing standard.

OBE,"CALGARY, Mar 7, 2018 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- Obsidian Energy Announces Year End 2017 Financial and Operational Results and Proposed Common Share Consolidation OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX/NYSE - OBE) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") is pleased to announce its financial and operational results for the year ended December 31, 2017. All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. Obsidian Energy's Management Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A"") dated March 6, 2018 and audited financial statements for year end 2017 can be found on our website at www.obsidianenergy.com. The documents will also be filed on SEDAR and EDGAR in due course. ""We are pleased to report an excellent fourth quarter and full year results,"" commented David French, President & CEO. ""2017 was a breakthrough year for the Company. Notwithstanding a challenging external environment, we consistently delivered on our operational objectives, beat our production guidance, and underpinned the shallow decline cash flows of the business. We grew our A&D adjusted production base in 2017 by approximately 10 percent, kick-starting a disciplined growth story, even while spending less capital and maintaining our focus on balance sheet strength. We continue to deliver strong results across our field operations, specifically within our Cardium acreage. Off the back of these results, we have found ways to put additional dollars to work in the highly economic Willesden Green fairway. The success of our 2017 program sets us up well for 2018 and beyond. We see many reasons to be excited for the future of Obsidian Energy."" Delivered Year over Year Production Growth of 10 Percent and Full Year 2017 Production above Guidance Full year 2017 production was 31,723 boe per day, above the high end of our guidance range of 30,500 - 31,500 boe per day. Ongoing waterflood and our shallow base decline, combined with solid execution of our second half development program drove the outperformance. Fourth quarter 2017 production was 31,447 boe per day, 10 percent higher than the previous year, adjusted for A&D. Relative to the third quarter, we grew total production and liquids production by four percent. This marks another quarter of consistent production delivery and advances our operational momentum into the first quarter of 2018. Total 2017 Capital Expenditures Beat Guidance, Including Cardium Drilling Acceleration Full year 2017 capital was $157 million, including decommissioning expenditures, below our guidance of $160 million. Fourth quarter capital was $44 million, including decommissioning expenditures, highlighted by our first foray into the Deep Basin and bringing on seven Cardium producing wells. We also executed a December start-up of five of our 2018 Cardium wells, while delaying some minor Cardium injector capital into 2018. Operating Expenses were Comfortably Within Guidance Range Full year and fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses were $13.40 per boe and $12.50 per boe, respectively, net of carried expenses. Growing production volumes offset higher maintenance and turnaround activity, driving a full year number that was comfortably within our guidance range of $13.00 - $13.50 per boe. As expected, our Peace River operating cost carry was fully utilized in December. The Company is well positioned for continuous operating cost improvement driven by a dedicated push for efficiency and our recent disposition of high cost legacy assets. As a result, we expect our cost basis, excluding any carry impact, to decrease year over year. Five Percent Higher Funds Flow from Operations versus 2016, Despite 42 Percent Less Production Full year Funds Flow from Operations was $192 million, up from $182 million in 2016. Despite meaningful disposition activity in 2016 that reduced production by 42 percent, the increase in FFO was supported by higher crude oil prices and more than $100 million less of gross operating expenses. Fourth quarter Funds Flow from Operations was $52 million, up from $40 million in the third quarter. Higher benchmark commodity prices, robust field realizations and strong production volumes drove the cash flow performance. Our light oil realizations were in line with benchmark expectations, while heavy oil and natural gas realizations were higher than benchmark pricing. Heavy oil realized pricing increased by 26 percent relative to the third quarter, compared to a 15 percent increase in Canadian Dollar heavy oil benchmark pricing. Our rail transportation and alternative price basis sales points reinforced the strong realized pricing in the quarter. A portion of our natural gas volumes are sold relative to a US Midwest market at Ventura. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Obsidian Energy had the benefit of selling approximately 30 mmcf per day into this market. The premium we received at Ventura contributed nearly $5 million additional to Funds Flow from Operations and was mainly due to a short term price spike, where our gas realizations averaged approximately $5.00 per mcf above AECO pricing in December. While a portion of our pricing arrangement ended in 2017, we retain 15 mmcf per day of Ventura marketing commitments through the third quarter of 2020. Demonstrating Cardium Drilling Consistency; Well Results Command Additional Investment Following on our recent four well pad in Willesden Green, initial rates from our two 2018 locations are exceeding expectations. The two well pad came on stream February 20 and has averaged approximately 900 boe per day through March 4, implying an average of 450 boe per day per well (88 percent liquids) over that timeframe. These strong initial results demonstrate the regular success we have had optimizing wellbore placement in the bioturbated interval and proven completion design. We plan to add three wells to our 2018 Willesden Green Cardium program. We expect one of those wells to come on stream in the second quarter, and the next two wells to come on stream early in the fourth quarter. We will fund these wells by reducing our Alberta Viking, Deep Basin and standalone waterflood capital outlays by a total of $9 million. Second Half Optionality Remains to Increase Returns and Enhance 2019 Outlook We have the operational flexibility to adjust our capital program as Alberta commodity prices allow. We will continue to be prudent with respect to balance sheet management, and will not call on debt to fund additional development. As next quarter's pricing plays out and we get further certainty on our full year cash flow profile, we will fine tune our capital program for the second half of the year.

Full year Funds Flow from Operations was $192 million, a five percent increase relative to 2016. -- Average liquids sales prices in the fourth quarter were $56.10 per boe and average natural gas sales prices were $2.51 per mcf. Strong realized pricing in the quarter is a result of our value adding marketing activities, specifically on heavy oil and natural gas. -- Fourth quarter operating costs were $12.50 per boe, net of carried expenses. As expected, operating costs were consistent with the third quarter and around $2 per boe below first half 2017, which had higher maintenance and turnaround activity. -- Invested $37 million of development capital expenditures across our key development areas and $7 million of decommission expenditures in the fourth quarter.

In Willesden Green, we brought on our four well pad late in December but due to extreme cold weather and third party pipeline curtailment, all four wells were not running at the same time until January 3, 2018. We brought on the final two wells of our three well Mannville program, our first foray into the Deep Basin. These three wells contributed approximately 1,300 boe per day to the quarter (net to OBE) with strong liquids yields averaging 55 bbl/mmcf (135 bbl/d per well). The second half 2017 Peace River program is currently producing approximately 2,100 boe per day gross production (1,200 boe per day net working interest). All 12 wells were on production by mid-December 2017. Per well results are consistent with expectations and reconfirm the upside we see within the heart of our acreage. Our second half 2017 Alberta Viking program is fully optimized and all 10 wells were on production early in the fourth quarter. The wells displayed initial rates above expectations, and the total program reached a peak rate of approximately 1,900 boe per day in the quarter. The wells averaged approximately 1,200 boe per day over the quarter. Operational Update Our four well pad in Willesden Green Cardium was on-stream as of January 3, 2018. IP30 for the wells averaged nearly 650 boe per day (87 percent liquids). The pad is currently producing approximately 1,200 boe per day. We expect injection support to mitigate decline rates and meaningfully enhance the ultimate recovery from the wells. Our two well pad in Willesden Green, approximately 20 kilometers east, was on stream February 20, 2018. The pad has averaged approximately 900 boe per day since the wells came on production, implying an average of 450 boe per day per well over that timeframe. We have elected to add three additional Willesden Green Cardium wells to our 2018 development plans, within close proximity to our recent program. The wells will be funded from other areas of our development program. We have drilled six and completed four wells in Pembina, which are accompanied by six low cost injector conversions for waterflood support. We expect these wells to be on production early in the second quarter. We recently finished drilling a two-mile Mannville (Falher) well which is expected to be on stream at the end of March. Initial pressure metrics and production tests look encouraging, and we expect the well to be highly economic due to our owned infrastructure processing advantage and high liquids content. We plan to drill another Deep Basin opportunity in the second half of 2018. Total 2018 capital expectations for Peace River are down slightly, and we shifted to a four well program from five wells. We believe four wells with varying lateral legs and lengths can deliver the same production wedge as originally anticipated. We are currently on the third of four wells and preliminary drilling and production test results are consistent with expectations.

Obsidian believes that a share consolidation will reduce its outstanding equity float to a level more suitable to the current size of the Company, appeal to a broader universe of investors and reinforce compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's minimum share price listing requirement. The proposed 3:1 ratio balances improved marketability for the shares, reduced transaction costs for lot trading and sufficient liquidity going forward. Shareholders will be asked to pass a special resolution that will authorize the Board of Directors to direct the Company to amend our articles, in order to consolidate (or reverse split) the Company's issued common shares into a lesser number of issued common shares on the basis of three (3) old common shares for one (1) new common share. The Board of Directors will retain the discretion to revoke the share consolidation resolution and elect not to proceed with the filing of the articles of amendment and the implementation of the share consolidation. A share consolidation will be subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. Further information regarding the potential share consolidation and timing of the Annual and General Meeting will be included in the Company's Management Information Circular to be disseminated later this spring.

Additional Reader Advisories Oil and Gas Information Advisory Barrels of oil equivalent (""boe"") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency conversion ratio of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis is misleading as an indication of value. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures including Funds Flow from Operations, Funds Flow from Operations per share-basic, Funds Flow from Operations per share-diluted, netback and net debt included in this press release do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore are considered non-GAAP measures; accordingly, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. Funds flow from Operations is cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital, decommissioning expenditures and office lease settlements which also excludes the effects of financing related transactions from foreign exchange contracts and debt repayments/ pre-payments and is representative of cash related to continuing operations. Funds Flow from Operations is used to assess the Company's ability to fund its planned capital programs. See ""Calculation of Funds Flow from Operations"" below for a reconciliation of Funds Flow from Operations to its nearest measure prescribed by IFRS. Netback is the per unit of production amount of revenue less royalties, operating expenses, transportation and realized risk management gains and losses, and is used in capital allocation decisions and to economically rank projects. See ""Financial and Operational Highlights"" above for a calculation of the Company's netbacks. Net debt includes long-term debt and includes the effects of working capital and all cash held on hand.

OBE,"CALGARY, Feb. 22, 2018 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX/NYSE - OBE) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") is pleased to announce that Jay W. Thornton has been appointed as Chairman of the Obsidian Energy Board of Directors (the ""Board""), effectively immediately. Mr. George Brookman, who has been the Acting Chair since August 8, 2017, will remain as a director on the Board. ""On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mr. George Brookman for his leadership as Acting Chair over the last several months,"" commented Mr. Thornton. ""George stepped in after the tragic passing of our previous Chairman, Rick George, and guided the Company with energy and thoughtful diligence. I look forward to continuing to steward our base strategy while exploring all opportunities to unlock shareholder value from our significant asset base."" Mr. Thornton has served on the Board since June 26, 2013 and has over 27 years of oil and gas experience, holding various operating and corporate executive positions with Shell Canada and Suncor Energy Inc. He is currently a director of North American Energy Partners Inc. and Tervita Corporation, and was previously a director with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). He is a graduate of McMaster University with an Honours degree in Economics. He also completed the Institute of Corporate Directors (ICD) Education Program. 2017 Year-End Reserves Summary The Company is pleased to present the results of its year-end 2017 independent reserves evaluation, prepared by Sproule Associates Limited (""Sproule""). ""Our year-end 2017 reserves highlight the revitalized operational delivery of the business,"" commented David French, President & CEO. ""2017 was the first time in five years we replaced produced reserves, and grew both our proved (""1P"") and proved plus probable (""2P"") volumes. It is gratifying to see the recognition of our field results by our reserve evaluator. Our updated book reflects the low decline nature of our Cardium waterflood business, and a conservative future development profile with plenty of upside. Continued recognition of the waterflood potential in our portfolio grew our 2P liquids weighting by six percent, and we hold a robust 2P reserve life index of 12 years. Adding reserves at just over $13 per boe through 2017 demonstrates a powerful engine to reward investors. We look forward to putting our capital to work."" The financial and operating information in this press release is based on estimates and is unaudited. Some of the terms below do not have standardized meanings. Further detail can be found in the ""Oil and Gas Advisory"" section contained in this release. This evaluation was prepared in accordance with definitions, standards, and procedures set out in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (""COGEH"") and National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (""NI 51-101""). Additional reserve information as required under NI 51-101 will be included in our Annual Information Form which will be filed on SEDAR, EDGAR, and posted to our website, on or about March 7, 2018. All numbers are shown prior to the impact of 2018 disposition activity unless otherwise noted. Replaced Over 100 Percent of Produced Reserves for the First Time in Five Years Increased conviction in inventory quality, high confidence in undeveloped book additions and efficient development activity drove strong reserve replacement across the business. We replaced 126 percent of 2017 production on a 2P reserves basis, 131 percent on a 1P reserves basis and 121 percent on a proved developed producing (""PDP"") reserves basis. Integrated Waterflood is Paying Dividends by Lowering Cardium Operated Development Costs Cardium operated development costs were $14.12 per boe, down 24 percent from year-end 2016 and 47 percent from year-end 2015. Reserve volumes associated with waterflood recovery, over and above primary development, now sit at 8.4 mmboe. The amount of future development capital (""FDC"") associated with this waterflood specific volume is approximately $94 million. As we continue to demonstrate decline performance in our base wells, we expect waterflood reserve volumes to increase without the need for additional future development capital. Total Corporate operated development costs for 2017 were $13.27 per boe. 2P finding and development (""F&D"") costs, including changes in future development capital, were $1.72 per boe. These costs reflect updates to our undeveloped book to account for low cost integrated waterflood development. Commercial Trades Increased Liquids Weighting by Six Percent Through the disposition of natural gas weighted production in the first quarter of 2017 and gas oil ratio suppression across our waterflood acreage, our 2P liquids weighting increased by six percent, to 67 percent total liquids. Including our 2018 legacy asset disposition, our 2P liquids weighting increased to 69 percent. The liquids weighting in our reserve book exceeds our 2018 forecasted weighting, representing the light oil growth potential of the business through increased focus on integrated waterflood development in the Cardium. Low Decline Rate Supports Seven Year PDP Reserve Life Our reserve book assumes an average decline rate of 16 percent in the next three years, demonstrating the sustainable production and cash flow inherent in our Cardium waterflood business. Based on Q4 2017 production and year-end 2017 reserves adjusted for disposition activity, PDP, 1P and 2P reserve life index (""RLI"") is 7 years, 8 years and 12 years, respectively. Formal Recognition of Deep Basin Potential and Upside to Undeveloped Book Sproule has formally recognized the potential of our Deep Basin position, with five undeveloped locations across the Mannville and Rock Creek formations. Our total undeveloped reserve book remains conservative and highly achievable, with approximately 200 total locations booked, including approximately 130 in the Cardium. Net Asset Value (""NAV"") Demonstrates Highly Confident and Fundable Upside in the Business Despite $55 million of negative pricing impacts, 2P net present value (""NPV"") 10 percent grew to $1.71 billion, relative to year-end 2016 A&D adjusted NPV10 of $1.67 billion. Our 2P NPV per share, adjusted for debt, equates to approximately $2.60 per share. Our PDP NPV per share, adjusted for debt, equates to approximately $1.50 per share. 2017 Year-End Reserves Tables In 2017, we engaged Sproule, an independent, qualified engineering firm, to evaluate one hundred percent of our 1P and 2P reserves. Sproule conducted an independent reserves evaluation of Obsidian Energy's reserves effective December 31, 2017. This evaluation was prepared in accordance with definitions, standards, and procedures set out in COGEH and NI 51-101. The Sproule reserves evaluation was based on Sproule's December 31, 2017 forecast prices and costs. Reserves included below are Company gross reserves which are the Company's total working interest reserves before the deduction of any royalties and excluding any royalty interests payable to the Company. The numbers in the tables below may not add due to rounding.

Oil and Gas Advisory This press release contains a number of oil and gas metrics, including ""FDC"", ""F&D costs"", ""Operated Development Costs"", ""NAV"", and ""RLI"" which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the Company's performance; however, such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the Company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods. FDC is the sum of all booked capital. F&D costs are the sum of exploration and development costs incurred in the period, plus the change in estimated FDC for the reserves category, all divided by the change in reserves during the period. F&D costs exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Operated Development Costs are the sum of drill, complete, equip, and tie-in costs to bring operated wells spud in the period on production, divided by the reserves added from these wells. NPV per share, adjusted for debt, is synonymous for NAV, and is based on the present value of future net revenues discounted at 10% before tax, adjusted for unaudited net debt as at December 31, 2017. The NPV per share is divided by the number of Obsidian Energy shares outstanding as at December 31, 2017. Reserves life index is calculated as total Company gross reserves divided by unaudited fourth quarter 2017 production. Under NI 51-101, proved reserves estimates are defined as having a high degree of certainty to be recoverable with a targeted 90 percent probability in aggregate that actual reserves recovered over time will equal or exceed proved reserve estimates. For proved plus probable reserves under NI 51-101, the targeted probability is an equal (50 percent) likelihood that the actual reserves to be recovered will be greater or less than the proved plus probable reserve estimate. The reserve estimates set forth below are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.

Forward Looking Statements Certain statements contained in this press release constitute forward-looking statements or information (collectively ""forward-looking statements""). Forward-looking statements are typically identified by words such as ""anticipate"", ""continue"", ""estimate"", ""expect"", ""forecast"", ""budget"", ""may"", ""will"", ""project"", ""could"", ""plan"", ""intend"", ""should"", ""believe"", ""outlook"", ""objective"", ""aim"", ""potential"", ""target"" and similar words suggesting future events or future performance. In addition, statements relating to ""reserves"" or ""resources"" are deemed to be forward-looking statements as they involve the implied assessment, based on certain estimates and assumptions, that the reserves and resources described exist in the quantities predicted or estimated and can be profitably produced in the future. In particular, this document contains forward-looking statements pertaining to, without limitation, the following: that our updated reserve book reflects the low decline nature of our Cardium waterflood business, and a conservative future development profile with plenty of upside; that we hold a robust 2P reserve life index; that our reserve additions at certain costs through 2017 demonstrate a powerful engine to reward investors and that we look forward to putting our capital to work; that additional reserve information, as required under NI 51-101, will be included in our Annual Information Form which will be filed on SEDAR, EDGAR and our website on or about March 7, 2018; our expectations for FDC and as we continue to demonstrate decline performance in our base wells, and that we expect waterflood reserves volumes to increase without the need for additional development capital; that our liquids weighting of our reserve book exceeds our forecast which demonstrates the light oil growth potential of the business through increased focus on integrated waterflood development in the Cardium; the average decline rate for the next three years in our reserve book which demonstrate the sustainable production and cash flow inherent in our Cardium waterflood business; our expected RLIs; and that our total undeveloped reserve book remains conservative and highly achievable. With respect to forward-looking statements contained in this document, we have made assumptions regarding, among other things that we do not dispose of any material producing properties; our ability to execute our long-term plan as described herein and in our other disclosure documents and the impact that the successful execution of such plan will have on our Company and our shareholders; that the current commodity price and foreign exchange environment will continue or improve; future capital expenditure levels; future crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas prices and differentials between light, medium and heavy oil prices and Canadian, WTI and world oil and natural gas prices; future crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas production levels; future exchange rates and interest rates; future debt levels; our ability to execute our capital programs as planned without significant adverse impacts from various factors beyond our control, including weather, infrastructure access and delays in obtaining regulatory approvals and third party consents; our ability to obtain equipment in a timely manner to carry out development activities and the costs thereof; our ability to market our oil and natural gas successfully to current and new customers; our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms, including our ability to renew or replace our syndicated bank facility and our ability to finance the repayment of our senior notes on maturity; and our ability to add production and reserves through our development and exploitation activities. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking statements contained in this document, and the assumptions on which such forward-looking statements are made, are reasonable, there can be no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct. Readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward-looking statements included in this document, as there can be no assurance that the plans, intentions or expectations upon which the forward-looking statements are based will occur. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve numerous assumptions, known and unknown risks and uncertainties that contribute to the possibility that the forward-looking statements contained herein will not be correct, which may cause our actual performance and financial results in future periods to differ materially from any estimates or projections of future performance or results expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include, among other things: the possibility that we will not be able to continue to successfully execute our long-term plan in part or in full, and the possibility that some or all of the benefits that we anticipate will accrue to our Company and our securityholders as a result of the successful execution of such plans do not materialize; the possibility that we are unable to execute some or all of our ongoing asset disposition program on favourable terms or at all; general economic and political conditions in Canada, the U.S. and globally, and in particular, the effect that those conditions have on commodity prices and our access to capital; industry conditions, including fluctuations in the price of crude oil, natural gas liquids and natural gas, price differentials for crude oil and natural gas produced in Canada as compared to other markets, and transportation restrictions, including pipeline and railway capacity constraints; fluctuations in foreign exchange or interest rates; unanticipated operating events or environmental events that can reduce production or cause production to be shut-in or delayed (including extreme cold during winter months, wild fires and flooding); and the other factors described under ""Risk Factors"" in our Annual Information Form and described in our public filings, available in Canada at www.sedar.com and in the United States at www.sec.gov. Readers are cautioned that this list of risk factors should not be construed as exhaustive. The forward-looking statements contained in this document speak only as of the date of this document. Except as expressly required by applicable securities laws, we do not undertake any obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.

OBE,"CALGARY, Jan. 31, 2018 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX/NYSE - OBE) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") is pleased to announce that we closed an agreement to dispose of a significant portion of our non-core legacy assets, in exchange for the assumption of abandonment and reclamation liabilities. David French, President & CEO commented, ""This transaction is another important step forward for Obsidian Energy. It demonstrates the continued refocusing of the business only on assets where we can deliver distinctive performance. Our team has been working many months to close this deal, and when coupled with the solid momentum of our 2017 production results, we are off to a running start for 2018. Moving these legacy assets out of the portfolio reduces our cost structure and provides even greater financial flexibility for our second half capital program and beyond."" Legacy Asset Transaction Streamlines Operations and Improves Corporate Metrics This legacy asset transaction demonstrates our commitment to maximizing value on behalf of all shareholders. It reduces our discounted decommissioning liabilities by approximately $25 million, improves 2018 netbacks by approximately $1.50/boe and increases our corporate liquids weighting to approximately 65 percent. The transaction is accretive to Funds Flow from Operations due to significant operating cost savings and high natural gas weighted production. Key 2017 metrics associated with the assets are as follows((1)):  Production 2,200 boe/d ---------- ----------- Liquids Weighting 25% ----------------- --- Operating Cost $25/boe -------------- ------- Field Netback (loss) ($4)/boe ------------------- -------- Wellbores(2) 650 ----------- --- Decommissioning Liability(3) $25MM --------------------------- -----   (1) 2017 figures are preliminary (2) Includes producing, non-producing and suspended wells (3) Inflated, discounted future reclamation and abandonment costs that are expected to be incurred over the life of the properties  The transaction is subject to standard regulatory approvals such as license transfers. 2018 Guidance Update We are revising our full year production and operating cost guidance to reflect the impact of the disposition, assuming a January 31, 2018 closing date:  2018 Annual Guidance -------------------- Production 29,000 to 30,000 boe per day Production Growth Rate (1) 5% Operating Costs $13.00 - $13.50 per boe General & Administrative $2.00 - $2.50 per boe ------------------------ --------------------   (1) Relative to full year 2017 production, adjusted for all 2017 & 2018 A&D, of 28,000 boe per day  Non-GAAP Measures Fund Flow from Operations, included in this press release, does not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore is considered non-GAAP measures; accordingly, it may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. Funds Flow from Operations is cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital, decommissioning expenditures and office lease settlements which also excludes the effects of financing related transactions from foreign exchange contracts and debt repayments/pre-payments and is representative of cash related to continuing operations. Funds Flow from Operations is used to assess the Company's ability to fund its planned capital programs.

OBE,"CALGARY, Jan. 17, 2018 (Canada NewsWire via COMTEX) -- OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX/NYSE - OBE) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") confirms it is aware of a statement by FrontFour Capital Group LLC (""FrontFour"") regarding their views on the direction of the Company. Obsidian Energy's corporate strategy is well defined and has the unanimous support of the Board of Directors (the""Board""). We have been organically growing the Company through the combination of sustaining a low decline production base and leveraging significant development optionality. The Company delivered strong results throughout the past year, and provided an operational update earlier this week that confirms the business plan is working. Those operational successes, along with our highly capital efficient 2018 plans, are a product of robust capital planning and a project review process with both Management and the Board. A change of course would hinder Obsidian Energy's progress and ability to deliver on the value maximizing efforts already underway. As part of our active and ongoing communications with all stakeholders, Obsidian Energy's Board and Management appreciate constructive shareholder input and take all views seriously. We received a letter from FrontFour in early October, which contained ideas we had already been pursuing for several months. In addition, we received a second letter from FrontFour in mid-December threatening ""more aggressive public action"", unless we agreed to the addition of a mutually agreed upon Director to the Board. In the interest of avoiding a costly and distracting proxy fight and as part of the Board's ongoing renewal process, our Board expressed a willingness to work with FrontFour regarding their views on Board composition. FrontFour had previously introduced the idea of Mr. Gordon Ritchie as a Board member, a suggestion our Board unanimously embraced due to the experience and credibility of Mr. Ritchie. Mr. Ritchie was appointed to the Board in December. Concurrently, the Board interviewed candidates proposed by FrontFour and mutually agreed to the addition of one of those individuals. The appointment was accompanied with the same standstill agreement executed by our latest Board addition, Mr. Edward (Ed) H. Kernaghan. Despite extensive negotiations, FrontFour was unwilling to execute the agreement. As a result, we were unable to add the mutually agreed upon candidate to the Board. One of the primary roles of our Board is to represent the interests of all shareholders. As indicated by our recent appointment of Mr. Kernaghan, our largest shareholder, we are supportive of ownership representation on the Board. Obsidian Energy's Board is now comprised of nine highly qualified and experienced directors, eight of whom are independent, including the Acting Chair. As part of our ongoing Board and governance process, the Governance Committee will nominate directors in advance of the Annual General Meeting that it believes will serve in the best interests of all shareholders. We look forward to continuing to deliver strong results on behalf of shareholders.

Jay Thornton, Chairman of the Obsidian Energy Board of Directors (the ""Board""), commented, ""We are disappointed that after several months of attempting to work constructively with FrontFour, including the addition of Gord Ritchie to the Board at their suggestion, FrontFour has chosen to put its interests ahead of other shareholders at a critical time in the Company's history by starting a costly, time consuming, and distracting proxy fight. Obsidian Energy has a refreshed Board with significant shareholder representation that is committed to value creation in both the short and long term. We recognize that status quo is not an option and have been pursuing attractive commercial opportunities to reward investors. FrontFour's unnecessary agenda only adds undue risk to the execution of these outcomes."" Gordon Ritchie, one of the newest members of the Board stated, ""I am in a position to say the strategic points raised by FrontFour have undergone extensive scrutiny by management and the Board. As communicated to FrontFour and all shareholders, we are aggressively looking at all options to increase shareholder value. This is a challenging investment environment for all Canadian E&P, but I am confident when I say Obsidian Energy is on the right track and David French and his group are the right team to execute."" Obsidian Energy will have more to say on FrontFour's agenda in due course. In the meantime, the Board and management team remain focused on executing our strategic plan to deliver strong results on behalf of all shareholders.

OBE,"GREENWICH, Conn., March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FrontFour Capital Group LLC together with its affiliates, a significant shareholder of Obsidian Energy Ltd. (""Obsidian"" or the ""Company"") (tsx/nyse:OBE), today issued an open letter to the Company's stockholders.  The full text of the letter follows:                                                                                                                        March 20, 2018 Dear Fellow Shareholders, As previously disclosed, FrontFour Capital Group LLC (together with its affiliates, ""FrontFour"" or ""we"") and its principals are significant long-term shareholders of Obsidian, collectively beneficially owning over 31 million shares, representing approximately 6.2% of Obsidian's outstanding shares.  Since issuing our first public letter to shareholders on January 17, 2018, Obsidian's shareholders have expressed a common theme of frustration with Obsidian's inconsistent and unsound strategic plan, flawed hedging strategy and poor leadership team. Accordingly, we are announcing our intention to nominate four highly qualified directors for election at Obsidian's 2018 annual general meeting. We intend to formally nominate our highly qualified candidates once the meeting has been called.  In the weeks to come, FrontFour will release its detailed value creation strategy at Obsidian, initially centered on streamlining the Company's organizational profile via: the disposition of the Company's remaining non-core legacy gas-weighted production; and the divestiture of Obsidian's operations in the Alberta Viking and Peace River. Obsidian has the ability to aggressively shift the drilling program to the higher return Cardium, where the Company has a deep and enviable inventory.  Given the size and resources of Obsidian it is very important to bring focus to the portfolio.  While the Alberta Viking and Peace River are both attractive assets, for Obsidian they are non-core and should be monetized.    Given that multiple parties have expressed interest to FrontFour in such assets, should they become available, we strongly believe this is an executable course of action. We believe the monetization of the Alberta Viking, Peace River and the remaining non-core legacy assets would result in: the ability to significantly reduce Obsidian's corporate general & administrative expense which is bloated, even when adjusting for their off-market legacy office lease expense; the removal of the negative drag on funds flow from operations (""FFO"") from the legacy gas-weighted production, thereby improving Obsidian's performance metrics, while also reducing asset retirement obligations; and allowing the Company to continue to delineate its acreage in the Mannville should condensate pricing remain strong. In turn, FrontFour's value creation strategy would focus on re-deploying the proceeds from the divestitures of the Alberta Viking and Peace River in the following manner: pay down enough debt to keep Obsidian's leverage ratio constant on a forward 12-month basis at strip; immediately expedite the Company's primary drilling program within the Cardium, specifically within the bioturbated zone within Willesden Green, with a focus on aggressively growing the Company's light oil-weighted production and by extension drive reserve and FFO growth and which would further deleverage the Company while displaying the true potential of its asset base; and initiate a share buyback program designed to take advantage of the significant discount at which the Company's shares currently trade relative to their intrinsic value, while also increasing shareholders' ownership exposure to the Company's dominant position in the Cardium which is highly coveted by potential strategic acquirers. On March 12, 2018, Obsidian announced a proposed 1:3 reverse stock split to be voted on at its 2018 annual general meeting.  This proposal is in response to a notification from the New York Stock Exchange (""NYSE"") that the Company was no longer in compliance with one of the NYSE's continued listing standards because the average closing price of Obsidian was less than US$1.00 per share over a consecutive 30 trading day period. FrontFour will be voting against the reverse stock split proposal. The historic track record of subsequent stock price performance by companies that execute reverse stock splits from perceived positions of weakness is very poor.  Furthermore, the proposal by management and the board of directors (the ""Board"") signals to us that they themselves may lack confidence in their operating and strategic plan to catalyze the stock price sustainably above US$1.00. In contrast, it is our strong belief that our plan would result in a value proposition for investors that would be valued significantly higher by the public equity markets and would quickly result in Obsidian being back in compliance with NYSE listing standards.  We believe our nominees' strong collective technical and operational expertise within the energy industry, coupled with significant financial and strategic experience across numerous complex situations, will bring a fresh perspective to the Board and will help drive the necessary decisions needed to close the significant value gap between Obsidian's current stock price relative to its intrinsic value. Biographies of FrontFour's Nominees: Steven P. Evans Mr. Evans had a 31-year career with Chevron / Texaco until his retirement in 2012.

Mr. Goldfarb is a founding partner and managing member of Southport Midstream Partners LLC, a private-equity backed investment vehicle focused on energy infrastructure projects in North America; Mr. Goldfarb also serves as Chief Restructuring Officer and Acting Chief Executive Officer of Cline Mining Corporation; Mr. Goldfarb previously served as Chief Executive Officer of Xinergy Ltd., having previously served as its Vice Chairman and lead independent director since its IPO in December 2009 through November 2013; Mr. Goldfarb previously was an attorney at Icahn Associates Corp. and Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP; and Mr. Goldfarb has served on the Boards of Sevcon, Inc., Midway Gold Corporation, The Pep Boys – Manny, Moe & Jack, Huntingdon Capital Corp., Fisher Communications, Inc., CKE Restaurants, Inc., and James River Coal Company. Stephen E. Loukas Mr. Loukas has nearly 20 years of experience as an investor, investment banker, and financial restructuring consultant with significant experience across a broad-based number of industries. Mr. Loukas has been a Managing Member and Portfolio Manager of FrontFour Capital Group LLC since February 2009 where he helps oversee the firm's investment portfolio; Previously, Mr. Loukas held roles including Director at Credit Suisse Securities where he was a Portfolio Manager and Head of Investment Research of the Multi-Product Event Proprietary Trading Group and at Pirate Capital where he was a senior investment analyst; Mr. Loukas has also worked within the Corporate Finance & Distribution Group of Scotia Capital where he focused on the structuring and syndication of leveraged loans and high yield debt; Mr. Loukas started his career at financial restructuring firm Zolfo Cooper where he assisted corporate clients in the development and implementation of operational and financial restructuring plans; and Mr. Loukas has previously served as a director of Xinergy Ltd. As stated in our January 17th letter to Obsidian's shareholders, we worked tirelessly to come to an amicable agreement with Obsidian's Board on the addition to the Board of one mutually agreed upon independent nominee proposed by FrontFour, as part of an effort to work constructively with the Company to maximize shareholder value.  In response, Obsidian's Board issued a defensive and inaccurate press release stating that it had negotiated in good faith, but that FrontFour had refused to sign the same agreement executed by Edward (Ed) H. Kerneghan in connection with his appointment to the Board.  The time has come for FrontFourtoset the record straight. Some of the settlement terms proposed by Obsidian at various times were as follows: Obsidian refused to be transparent as to the composition of the Board slate for the 2018 annual general meeting and insisted upon retaining the ability to replace undisclosed incumbent directors with new (and also undisclosed) director candidates at the meeting – an outcome which had the potential to more than offset the positive board influence that FrontFour is looking to effectuate through its Board nominees; Nevertheless, Obsidian wanted FrontFour to agree to vote in accordance with all of management's future recommendations on all matters of business through January 1, 2019; and FrontFour was initially denied a standard replacement right in the event that their mutually agreed upon director became unable to serve in the future, and was then asked to agree to only have the right to recommend a replacement that would be considered (and potentially rejected) at the Board's sole discretion. These and other terms proposed by Obsidian were off-market in the context of a settlement agreement of this nature. Neither FrontFour nor any sophisticated institutional shareholder would, consistent with their fiduciary obligations to their investors, effectively hand over blank proxies to Obsidian's management and existing Board.However, most importantly, we believe agreeing to these terms would have further entrenched this Board and resulted in an extension of the value destructive status quo at Obsidian. We are committed, long-term investors with a strong track record of alignment and value creation in situations where we have sought change.  We believe that significant upside exists in Obsidian's shares from current levels.  The current Board has had ample time and opportunity to identify and unlock that value, but has failed.  The time for change at Obsidian has come. Sincerely, Zachary R. George Portfolio Manager David A. Lorber Portfolio Manager Stephen E.

The issuance of the notification is not discretionary and is sent automatically when a listed company's share price falls below the NYSE's minimum price listing standard. As described in our press release dated March 7, 2018, Obsidian Energy will propose a consolidation of the Company's outstanding common shares at the upcoming Annual General Meeting. Obsidian Energy believes that a share consolidation will reduce its outstanding equity float to a level more suitable to the current size of the Company and appeal to a broader universe of investors. The proposed consolidation also seeks to remedy our non-compliance with the NYSE's minimum share price listing standard. Under the NYSE's rules, Obsidian Energy can avoid delisting if, within six months from the date of the NYSE notification, its common shares have a closing price on the last trading day of any calendar month and a concurrent 30 trading day average closing price of at least US$1.00 per share. Therefore, the price condition following the proposed consolidation is cured if the common share price promptly exceeds US$1.00 and remains above that level for at least the following 30 trading days. If at the expiration of the applicable cure period Obsidian Energy has not regained compliance, the NYSE will commence suspension and delisting procedures. Non-compliance with the NYSE's price listing standard does not affect Obsidian Energy's business operations or its reporting requirements to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), nor does it breach or cause an event of default under any of Obsidian Energy's agreements with its lenders. Obsidian Energy continues to be in compliance with the terms of all of those agreements. In addition, non-compliance with the NYSE price listing standard does not affect the continued listing and trading of Obsidian Energy's common shares on the Toronto Stock Exchange ()TSX""). Obsidian Energy intends to notify the NYSE within 10 business days from the date of the notification that it intends to cure this price deficiency and return to compliance with the NYSE's price listing standard prior to the expiration of the applicable cure period. Obsidian Energy's common shares will continue to be listed and traded on the NYSE during the applicable cure period, subject to compliance with the NYSE's other continued listing standards, under the symbol ""OBE"", but the NYSE will assign a "".BC"" indicator to the symbol to denote that Obsidian Energy is below the NYSE's price listing standard. This indicator will be removed at such time as Obsidian Energy is deemed compliant with the NYSE's price listing standard.

OBE,"CALGARY, March 7, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX/NYSE – OBE) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") is pleased to announce its financial and operational results for the year ended December 31, 2017. All figures are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise stated. Obsidian Energy's Management Discussion and Analysis (""MD&A"") dated March 6, 2018 and audited financial statements for year end 2017 can be found on our website at www.obsidianenergy.com. The documents will also be filed on SEDAR and EDGAR in due course. ""We are pleased to report an excellent fourth quarter and full year results,"" commented David French, President & CEO. ""2017 was a breakthrough year for the Company. Notwithstanding a challenging external environment, we consistently delivered on our operational objectives, beat our production guidance, and underpinned the shallow decline cash flows of the business. We grew our A&D adjusted production base in 2017 by approximately 10 percent, kick-starting a disciplined growth story, even while spending less capital and maintaining our focus on balance sheet strength. We continue to deliver strong results across our field operations, specifically within our Cardium acreage. Off the back of these results, we have found ways to put additional dollars to work in the highly economic Willesden Green fairway. The success of our 2017 program sets us up well for 2018 and beyond. We see many reasons to be excited for the future of Obsidian Energy."" Delivered Year over Year Production Growth of 10 Percent and Full Year 2017 Production above Guidance Full year 2017 production was 31,723 boe per day, above the high end of our guidance range of 30,500 – 31,500 boe per day. Ongoing waterflood and our shallow base decline, combined with solid execution of our second half development program drove the outperformance. Fourth quarter 2017 production was 31,447 boe per day, 10 percent higher than the previous year, adjusted for A&D. Relative to the third quarter, we grew total production and liquids production by four percent. This marks another quarter of consistent production delivery and advances our operational momentum into the first quarter of 2018. Total 2017 Capital Expenditures Beat Guidance, Including Cardium Drilling Acceleration Full year 2017 capital was $157 million, including decommissioning expenditures, below our guidance of $160 million. Fourth quarter capital was $44 million, including decommissioning expenditures, highlighted by our first foray into the Deep Basin and bringing on seven Cardium producing wells. We also executed a December start-up of five of our 2018 Cardium wells, while delaying some minor Cardium injector capital into 2018. Operating Expenses were Comfortably Within Guidance Range Full year and fourth quarter 2017 operating expenses were $13.40 per boe and $12.50 per boe, respectively, net of carried expenses. Growing production volumes offset higher maintenance and turnaround activity, driving a full year number that was comfortably within our guidance range of $13.00 - $13.50 per boe. As expected, our Peace River operating cost carry was fully utilized in December. The Company is well positioned for continuous operating cost improvement driven by a dedicated push for efficiency and our recent disposition of high cost legacy assets. As a result, we expect our cost basis, excluding any carry impact, to decrease year over year. Five Percent Higher Funds Flow from Operations versus 2016, Despite 42 Percent Less Production Full year Funds Flow from Operations was $192 million, up from $182 million in 2016. Despite meaningful disposition activity in 2016 that reduced production by 42 percent, the increase in FFO was supported by higher crude oil prices and more than $100 million less of gross operating expenses. Fourth quarter Funds Flow from Operations was $52 million, up from $40 million in the third quarter. Higher benchmark commodity prices, robust field realizations and strong production volumes drove the cash flow performance. Our light oil realizations were in line with benchmark expectations, while heavy oil and natural gas realizations were higher than benchmark pricing. Heavy oil realized pricing increased by 26 percent relative to the third quarter, compared to a 15 percent increase in Canadian Dollar heavy oil benchmark pricing. Our rail transportation and alternative price basis sales points reinforced the strong realized pricing in the quarter. A portion of our natural gas volumes are sold relative to a US Midwest market at Ventura. In the fourth quarter of 2017, Obsidian Energy had the benefit of selling approximately 30 mmcf per day into this market. The premium we received at Ventura contributed nearly $5 million additional to Funds Flow from Operations and was mainly due to a short term price spike, where our gas realizations averaged approximately $5.00 per mcf above AECO pricing in December. While a portion of our pricing arrangement ended in 2017, we retain 15 mmcf per day of Ventura marketing commitments through the third quarter of 2020. Demonstrating Cardium Drilling Consistency; Well Results Command Additional Investment Following on our recent four well pad in Willesden Green, initial rates from our two 2018 locations are exceeding expectations. The two well pad came on stream February 20 and has averaged approximately 900 boe per day through March 4, implying an average of 450 boe per day per well (88 percent liquids) over that timeframe. These strong initial results demonstrate the regular success we have had optimizing wellbore placement in the bioturbated interval and proven completion design. We plan to add three wells to our 2018 Willesden Green Cardium program. We expect one of those wells to come on stream in the second quarter, and the next two wells to come on stream early in the fourth quarter. We will fund these wells by reducing our Alberta Viking, Deep Basin and standalone waterflood capital outlays by a total of $9 million. Second Half Optionality Remains to Increase Returns and Enhance 2019 Outlook We have the operational flexibility to adjust our capital program as Alberta commodity prices allow. We will continue to be prudent with respect to balance sheet management, and will not call on debt to fund additional development. As next quarter's pricing plays out and we get further certainty on our full year cash flow profile, we will fine tune our capital program for the second half of the year.

(3) Please refer to the ""Oil and Gas Information Advisory"" section below for information regarding the term ""boe"".  (4) Includes the benefit of carried operating expenses from its partner under the Peace River Oil Partnership of $6 million or $1.89 per boe (2016 – $5 million or $1.30 per boe) for the three months ended and $21 million or $1.78 per boe (2016 – $15 million or $0.75 per boe) for the year ended on a combined basis. Funds Flow from Operations for the fourth quarter was $52 million, reflecting stronger realized pricing primarily due to an increase in US$ WTI and Ventura pricing. Full year Funds Flow from Operations was $192 million, a five percent increase relative to 2016. Average liquids sales prices in the fourth quarter were $56.10 per boe and average natural gas sales prices were $2.51 per mcf. Strong realized pricing in the quarter is a result of our value adding marketing activities, specifically on heavy oil and natural gas. Fourth quarter operating costs were $12.50 per boe, net of carried expenses. As expected, operating costs were consistent with the third quarter and around $2 per boe below first half 2017, which had higher maintenance and turnaround activity. Invested $37 million of development capital expenditures across our key development areas and $7 million of decommission expenditures in the fourth quarter. Full year development capital and decommission expenditures were $141 million and $16 million, respectively. Total Net Debt was $383 million at December 31, 2017, $119 million lower than the prior year. Net debt includes $253 million drawn on our revolving credit facility and $106 million of Senior Notes.

In Willesden Green, we brought on our four well pad late in December but due to extreme cold weather and third party pipeline curtailment, all four wells were not running at the same time until January 3, 2018. We brought on the final two wells of our three well Mannville program, our first foray into the Deep Basin.  These three wells contributed approximately 1,300 boe per day to the quarter (net to OBE) with strong liquids yields averaging 55 bbl/mmcf (135 bbl/d per well). The second half 2017 Peace River program is currently producing approximately 2,100 boe per day gross production (1,200 boe per day net working interest). All 12 wells were on production by mid-December 2017. Per well results are consistent with expectations and reconfirm the upside we see within the heart of our acreage. Our second half 2017 Alberta Viking program is fully optimized and all 10 wells were on production early in the fourth quarter. The wells displayed initial rates above expectations, and the total program reached a peak rate of approximately 1,900 boe per day in the quarter. The wells averaged approximately 1,200 boe per day over the quarter. Operational Update Our four well pad in Willesden Green Cardium was on-stream as of January 3, 2018. IP30 for the wells averaged nearly 650 boe per day (87 percent liquids). The pad is currently producing approximately 1,200 boe per day. We expect injection support to mitigate decline rates and meaningfully enhance the ultimate recovery from the wells. Our two well pad in Willesden Green, approximately 20 kilometers east, was on stream February 20, 2018. The pad has averaged approximately 900 boe per day since the wells came on production, implying an average of 450 boe per day per well over that timeframe. We have elected to add three additional Willesden Green Cardium wells to our 2018 development plans, within close proximity to our recent program. The wells will be funded from other areas of our development program. We have drilled six and completed four wells in Pembina, which are accompanied by six low cost injector conversions for waterflood support. We expect these wells to be on production early in the second quarter. We recently finished drilling a two-mile Mannville (Falher) well which is expected to be on stream at the end of March. Initial pressure metrics and production tests look encouraging, and we expect the well to be highly economic due to our owned infrastructure processing advantage and high liquids content. We plan to drill another Deep Basin opportunity in the second half of 2018. Total 2018 capital expectations for Peace River are down slightly, and we shifted to a four well program from five wells. We believe four wells with varying lateral legs and lengths can deliver the same production wedge as originally anticipated. We are currently on the third of four wells and preliminary drilling and production test results are consistent with expectations. Our second half Alberta Viking program is highly economic, targeting structural lows to maximize light oil productivity. The program will be drilled in the third quarter. Updated Hedging Position We continued our active hedging program and extended our hedge book into 2019. Currently, the Company has the following crude oil hedges in place:  Q1 2018 Q2 2018 Q3 2018 Q4 2018 Q1 2019 Q2 2019 Q3 2019 WTI $USD $50.82 $50.00 $50.05 $49.78 $50.02 $56.53 $57.00  bbl/day 7,000 7,000 8,000 8,000 3,000 2,000 1,000 WTI $CAD $71.03 $71.03 $71.04 $71.04 $67.88 $68.58 -  bbl/day 5,000 5,000 4,000 4,000 6,000 4,000 - Total         bbl/day 12,000 12,000 12,000 12,000 9,000 6,000 1,000 Additionally, the Company has the following foreign exchange contracts in place for 2018: Foreign exchange swaps on revenues at an average of 1.268 on notional US$9 million per month Foreign exchange collar on revenues at an average of 1.210 – 1.272 on notional US$2 million per month Foreign exchange swaps on May 2018 debt maturities at an average of 1.233 on US$15 million Currently, the Company has the following natural gas hedges in place:  Q1 2018   Q2 2018 Q3 2018   Q4 2018 AECO $CAD $2.83 $2.72 $2.67 $2.67    mcf/day 28,400 22,700 17,100 15,200  Ventura $USD (1) $2.79 $2.79 $2.79 $2.79    mcf/day 7,500 7,500 7,500 7,500  Total         mcf/day 35,900 30,200 24,600 22,700 (1) Until the third quarter of 2020, the Company has an agreement in place to sell 15 mmcf per day at the Ventura index price less the cost of transportation from AECO. Ventura pricing in the fourth quarter averaged approximately $4.00 per mcf.  Recent transportation deductions for the Company to bring product to the Ventura market have been approximately $0.55 per mcf.   2018 Guidance Summary Our total 2018 guidance remains unchanged: 2018 Annual Guidance Production 29,000 to 30,000 boe per day Production Growth Rate (1) 5% Operating Costs $13.00 - $13.50 per boe General & Administrative $2.00 - $2.50 per boe (1) Relative to full year 2017 production, adjusted for all 2017 & 2018 A&D, of 28,000 boe per day   Our Total Capital Expenditure Guidance remains the same, but accounts for the reallocation as noted below: Capital Category # of Operated Wells Net Capital Cardium 11 Producers $51 million Deep Basin 2 Producers $7 million Peace River 4 Producers $8 million Alberta Viking 4 Producers $6 million Existing Wellbore Optimization >50 Projects $14 million Total Development 21 Producers $86 million Regulatory Directive 84 Requirements  $14 million Infrastructure & Corporate Capital  $25 million Total E&D Capital Expenditures  $125 million Decommissioning Expenditures  $10 million Total Capital Expenditures  $135 million Proposed Share Consolidation Obsidian Energy will propose a consolidation of the Company's outstanding common shares at the upcoming Annual and General Meeting. Obsidian believes that a share consolidation will reduce its outstanding equity float to a level more suitable to the current size of the Company, appeal to a broader universe of investors and reinforce compliance with the New York Stock Exchange's minimum share price listing requirement. The proposed 3:1 ratio balances improved marketability for the shares, reduced transaction costs for lot trading and sufficient liquidity going forward. Shareholders will be asked to pass a special resolution that will authorize the Board of Directors to direct the Company to amend our articles, in order to consolidate (or reverse split) the Company's issued common shares into a lesser number of issued common shares on the basis of three (3) old common shares for one (1) new common share. The Board of Directors will retain the discretion to revoke the share consolidation resolution and elect not to proceed with the filing of the articles of amendment and the implementation of the share consolidation. A share consolidation will be subject to approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange. Further information regarding the potential share consolidation and timing of the Annual and General Meeting will be included in the Company's Management Information Circular to be disseminated later this spring.

Additional Reader Advisories Oil and Gas Information Advisory Barrels of oil equivalent (""boe"") may be misleading, particularly if used in isolation. A boe conversion ratio of six thousand cubic feet of natural gas to one barrel of crude oil is based on an energy equivalency conversion method primarily applicable at the burner tip and does not represent a value equivalency at the wellhead. Given that the value ratio based on the current price of crude oil as compared to natural gas is significantly different from the energy equivalency conversion ratio of 6:1, utilizing a conversion on a 6:1 basis is misleading as an indication of value. Non-GAAP Measures Certain financial measures including Funds Flow from Operations, Funds Flow from Operations per share-basic, Funds Flow from Operations per share-diluted, netback and net debt included in this press release do not have a standardized meaning prescribed by IFRS and therefore are considered non-GAAP measures; accordingly, they may not be comparable to similar measures provided by other issuers. Funds flow from Operations is cash flow from operating activities before changes in non-cash working capital, decommissioning expenditures and office lease settlements which also excludes the effects of financing related transactions from foreign exchange contracts and debt repayments/ pre-payments and is representative of cash related to continuing operations. Funds Flow from Operations is used to assess the Company's ability to fund its planned capital programs. See ""Calculation of Funds Flow from Operations"" below for a reconciliation of Funds Flow from Operations to its nearest measure prescribed by IFRS. Netback is the per unit of production amount of revenue less royalties, operating expenses, transportation and realized risk management gains and losses, and is used in capital allocation decisions and to economically rank projects. See ""Financial and Operational Highlights"" above for a calculation of the Company's netbacks. Net debt includes long-term debt and includes the effects of working capital and all cash held on hand.

OBE,"CALGARY, Feb. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX/NYSE – OBE) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") is pleased to announce that Jay W. Thornton has been appointed as Chairman of the Obsidian Energy Board of Directors (the ""Board""), effectively immediately. Mr. George Brookman, who has been the Acting Chair since August 8, 2017, will remain as a director on the Board. ""On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mr. George Brookman for his leadership as Acting Chair over the last several months,"" commented Mr. Thornton. ""George stepped in after the tragic passing of our previous Chairman, Rick George, and guided the Company with energy and thoughtful diligence. I look forward to continuing to steward our base strategy while exploring all opportunities to unlock shareholder value from our significant asset base."" Mr. Thornton has served on the Board since June 26, 2013 and has over 27 years of oil and gas experience, holding various operating and corporate executive positions with Shell Canada and Suncor Energy Inc. He is currently a director of North American Energy Partners Inc. and Tervita Corporation, and was previously a director with the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). He is a graduate of McMaster University with an Honours degree in Economics. He also completed the Institute of Corporate Directors (ICD) Education Program. 2017 Year-End Reserves Summary The Company is pleased to present the results of its year-end 2017 independent reserves evaluation, prepared by Sproule Associates Limited (""Sproule""). ""Our year-end 2017 reserves highlight the revitalized operational delivery of the business,"" commented David French, President & CEO. ""2017 was the first time in five years we replaced produced reserves, and grew both our proved (""1P"") and proved plus probable ()2P"") volumes. It is gratifying to see the recognition of our field results by our reserve evaluator. Our updated book reflects the low decline nature of our Cardium waterflood business, and a conservative future development profile with plenty of upside. Continued recognition of the waterflood potential in our portfolio grew our 2P liquids weighting by six percent, and we hold a robust 2P reserve life index of 12 years. Adding reserves at just over $13 per boe through 2017 demonstrates a powerful engine to reward investors. We look forward to putting our capital to work."" The financial and operating information in this press release is based on estimates and is unaudited. Some of the terms below do not have standardized meanings. Further detail can be found in the ""Oil and Gas Advisory"" section contained in this release. This evaluation was prepared in accordance with definitions, standards, and procedures set out in the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (""COGEH"") and National Instrument 51-101 Standards of Disclosure for Oil and Gas Activities (""NI 51-101""). Additional reserve information as required under NI 51-101 will be included in our Annual Information Form which will be filed on SEDAR, EDGAR, and posted to our website, on or about March 7, 2018. All numbers are shown prior to the impact of 2018 disposition activity unless otherwise noted. Replaced Over 100 Percent of Produced Reserves for the First Time in Five Years Increased conviction in inventory quality, high confidence in undeveloped book additions and efficient development activity drove strong reserve replacement across the business. We replaced 126 percent of 2017 production on a 2P reserves basis, 131 percent on a 1P reserves basis and 121 percent on a proved developed producing (""PDP"") reserves basis. Integrated Waterflood is Paying Dividends by Lowering Cardium Operated Development Costs Cardium operated development costs were $14.12 per boe, down 24 percent from year-end 2016 and 47 percent from year-end 2015. Reserve volumes associated with waterflood recovery, over and above primary development, now sit at 8.4 mmboe. The amount of future development capital (""FDC"") associated with this waterflood specific volume is approximately $94 million. As we continue to demonstrate decline performance in our base wells, we expect waterflood reserve volumes to increase without the need for additional future development capital. Total Corporate operated development costs for 2017 were $13.27 per boe. 2P finding and development (""F&D"") costs, including changes in future development capital, were $1.72 per boe. These costs reflect updates to our undeveloped book to account for low cost integrated waterflood development. Commercial Trades Increased Liquids Weighting by Six Percent Through the disposition of natural gas weighted production in the first quarter of 2017 and gas oil ratio suppression across our waterflood acreage, our 2P liquids weighting increased by six percent, to 67 percent total liquids. Including our 2018 legacy asset disposition, our 2P liquids weighting increased to 69 percent. The liquids weighting in our reserve book exceeds our 2018 forecasted weighting, representing the light oil growth potential of the business through increased focus on integrated waterflood development in the Cardium. Low Decline Rate Supports Seven Year PDP Reserve Life Our reserve book assumes an average decline rate of 16 percent in the next three years, demonstrating the sustainable production and cash flow inherent in our Cardium waterflood business. Based on Q4 2017 production and year-end 2017 reserves adjusted for disposition activity, PDP, 1P and 2P reserve life index (""RLI"") is 7 years, 8 years and 12 years, respectively. Formal Recognition of Deep Basin Potential and Upside to Undeveloped Book Sproule has formally recognized the potential of our Deep Basin position, with five undeveloped locations across the Mannville and Rock Creek formations. Our total undeveloped reserve book remains conservative and highly achievable, with approximately 200 total locations booked, including approximately 130 in the Cardium. Net Asset Value (""NAV"") Demonstrates Highly Confident and Fundable Upside in the Business Despite $55 million of negative pricing impacts, 2P net present value (""NPV"") 10 percent grew to $1.71 billion, relative to year-end 2016 A&D adjusted NPV10 of $1.67 billion. Our 2P NPV per share, adjusted for debt, equates to approximately $2.60 per share. Our PDP NPV per share, adjusted for debt, equates to approximately $1.50 per share. 2017 Year-End Reserves Tables In 2017, we engaged Sproule, an independent, qualified engineering firm, to evaluate one hundred percent of our 1P and 2P reserves. Sproule conducted an independent reserves evaluation of Obsidian Energy's reserves effective December 31, 2017. This evaluation was prepared in accordance with definitions, standards, and procedures set out in COGEH and NI 51-101. The Sproule reserves evaluation was based on Sproule's December 31, 2017 forecast prices and costs. Reserves included below are Company gross reserves which are the Company's total working interest reserves before the deduction of any royalties and excluding any royalty interests payable to the Company. The numbers in the tables below may not add due to rounding.

Oil and Gas Advisory This press release contains a number of oil and gas metrics, including ""FDC"", ""F&D costs"", ""Operated Development Costs"", ""NAV"", and ""RLI"" which do not have standardized meanings or standard methods of calculation and therefore such measures may not be comparable to similar measures used by other companies. Such metrics have been included herein to provide readers with additional measures to evaluate the Company's performance; however, such measures are not reliable indicators of the future performance of the Company and future performance may not compare to the performance in previous periods. FDC is the sum of all booked capital. F&D costs are the sum of exploration and development costs incurred in the period, plus the change in estimated FDC for the reserves category, all divided by the change in reserves during the period. F&D costs exclude the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. Operated Development Costs are the sum of drill, complete, equip, and tie-in costs to bring operated wells spud in the period on production, divided by the reserves added from these wells.  NPV per share, adjusted for debt, is synonymous for NAV, and is based on the present value of future net revenues discounted at 10% before tax, adjusted for unaudited net debt as at December 31, 2017. The NPV per share is divided by the number of Obsidian Energy shares outstanding as at December 31, 2017. Reserves life index is calculated as total Company gross reserves divided by unaudited fourth quarter 2017 production. Under NI 51-101, proved reserves estimates are defined as having a high degree of certainty to be recoverable with a targeted 90 percent probability in aggregate that actual reserves recovered over time will equal or exceed proved reserve estimates. For proved plus probable reserves under NI 51-101, the targeted probability is an equal (50 percent) likelihood that the actual reserves to be recovered will be greater or less than the proved plus probable reserve estimate. The reserve estimates set forth below are estimates only and there is no guarantee that the estimated reserves will be recovered. Actual reserves may be greater than or less than the estimates provided herein.

OBE,"CALGARY, Jan. 31, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX/NYSE – OBE) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") is pleased to announce that we closed an agreement to dispose of a significant portion of our non-core legacy assets, in exchange for the assumption of abandonment and reclamation liabilities. David French, President & CEO commented, ""This transaction is another important step forward for Obsidian Energy. It demonstrates the continued refocusing of the business only on assets where we can deliver distinctive performance. Our team has been working many months to close this deal, and when coupled with the solid momentum of our 2017 production results, we are off to a running start for 2018. Moving these legacy assets out of the portfolio reduces our cost structure and provides even greater financial flexibility for our second half capital program and beyond."" Legacy Asset Transaction Streamlines Operations and Improves Corporate Metrics This legacy asset transaction demonstrates our commitment to maximizing value on behalf of all shareholders.

OBE,"CALGARY, Jan. 17, 2018 /PRNewswire/ - OBSIDIAN ENERGY LTD. (TSX/NYSE – OBE) (""Obsidian Energy"", the ""Company"", ""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") confirms it is aware of a statement by FrontFour Capital Group LLC (""FrontFour"") regarding their views on the direction of the Company. Obsidian Energy's corporate strategy is well defined and has the unanimous support of the Board of Directors (the""Board""). We have been organically growing the Company through the combination of sustaining a low decline production base and leveraging significant development optionality. The Company delivered strong results throughout the past year, and provided an operational update earlier this week that confirms the business plan is working. Those operational successes, along with our highly capital efficient 2018 plans, are a product of robust capital planning and a project review process with both Management and the Board. A change of course would hinder Obsidian Energy's progress and ability to deliver on the value maximizing efforts already underway. As part of our active and ongoing communications with all stakeholders, Obsidian Energy's Board and Management appreciate constructive shareholder input and take all views seriously. We received a letter from FrontFour in early October, which contained ideas we had already been pursuing for several months. In addition, we received a second letter from FrontFour in mid-December threatening ""more aggressive public action"", unless we agreed to the addition of a mutually agreed upon Director to the Board. In the interest of avoiding a costly and distracting proxy fight and as part of the Board's ongoing renewal process, our Board expressed a willingness to work with FrontFour regarding their views on Board composition. FrontFour had previously introduced the idea of Mr. Gordon Ritchie as a Board member, a suggestion our Board unanimously embraced due to the experience and credibility of Mr. Ritchie. Mr. Ritchie was appointed to the Board in December. Concurrently, the Board interviewed candidates proposed by FrontFour and mutually agreed to the addition of one of those individuals. The appointment was accompanied with the same standstill agreement executed by our latest Board addition, Mr. Edward (Ed) H. Kernaghan. Despite extensive negotiations, FrontFour was unwilling to execute the agreement. As a result, we were unable to add the mutually agreed upon candidate to the Board. One of the primary roles of our Board is to represent the interests of all shareholders. As indicated by our recent appointment of Mr. Kernaghan, our largest shareholder, we are supportive of ownership representation on the Board. Obsidian Energy's Board is now comprised of nine highly qualified and experienced directors, eight of whom are independent, including the Acting Chair. As part of our ongoing Board and governance process, the Governance Committee will nominate directors in advance of the Annual General Meeting that it believes will serve in the best interests of all shareholders. We look forward to continuing to deliver strong results on behalf of shareholders.
