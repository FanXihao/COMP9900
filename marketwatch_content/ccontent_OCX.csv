OCX,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The matters addressed in this Item 2 that are not historical information constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including statements about any of the following: any projections of earnings, revenue, cash, effective tax rate, use of net operating losses, or any other financial items; the plans, strategies and objectives of management for future operations or prospects for achieving such plans, and any statements of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing. Any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be deemed to be forward-looking statements. Without limiting the foregoing, the words ""believes,"" ""anticipates,"" ""plans,"" ""expects,"" ""seeks,"" ""estimates,"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. While OncoCyte may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if the OncoCyte estimates change and readers should not rely on those forward-looking statements as representing OncoCyte views as of any date subsequent to the date of the filing of this Quarterly Report. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forward-looking statements are reasonable, such statements are inherently subject to risks and OncoCyte can give no assurances that its expectations will prove to be correct. Actual results could differ materially from those described in this report because of numerous factors, many of which are beyond the control of OncoCyte. A number of important factors could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements, including those detailed under the heading ""Risk Factors"" in Part I, Item 1A of OncoCyte Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. The following discussion should be read in conjunction with OncoCyte's interim condensed financial statements and the related notes provided under ""Item 1- Financial Statements"" above. Critical Accounting Policies This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses and analyzes data in our unaudited condensed interim financial statements, which we have prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of these estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. Actual conditions may differ from our assumptions and actual results may differ from our estimates. An accounting policy is deemed critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made, if different estimates reasonably could have been used, or if changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur, that could materially impact the financial statements. Management believes that there have been no significant changes during the three months ended March 31, 2017 to the items that we disclosed as our critical accounting policies and estimates in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Results of Operations Comparison of three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 The following tables show our operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 (in thousands). Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 $ Increase % Increase Research and development expenses $1,834 $1,689 $145 8.6% General and administrative expenses 2,043 1,015 1,028 101.3% Sales and marketing expenses 655 228 427 187.3%  Research and development expenses The following table shows the approximate amounts and percentages of our total research and development expenses allocated to our primary research and development projects during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively (in thousands).  Amount(1) Percent Program 2017 2016 2017 2016 General $728 $413 39.7% 24.4% Lung cancer confirmatory diagnostic 644 805 35.1% 47.7% Bladder cancer confirmatory diagnostic 21 191 1.1% 11.3% Breast cancer confirmatory diagnostic 115 240 6.3% 14.2% Diagnostics laboratory 240 35 13.1% 2.1% Prosigna and other 86 5 4.7% 0.3% Total $1,834 $1,689 100% 100%  (1) Amounts also include certain general research and development expenses, such as laboratory supplies, laboratory expenses, rent allocated, and insurance allocated to research and development expenses, incurred directly by BioTime on behalf of OncoCyte and allocated to OncoCyte under the Shared Facilities Agreement. The increases in research and development expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 are primarily attributable to increases of $205,000 in salaries and payroll related expenses, $168,000 in stock based compensation expenses, $94,000 in laboratory expenses, $88,000 in research and development expenses allocated to us by BioTime, $73,000 in clinical trial expenses and $55,000 in depreciation expense due to additional equipment financed or purchased. These increases were offset by decreases of $404,000 in outside services expenses and $121,000 in consulting services primarily due to the increased headcount and decreased reliance upon services from consultants and other third parties, consistent with the increases in payroll and related expenses. We expect to continue to incur a significant amount of research and development expenses during the foreseeable future. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased in comparison to the comparable period in 2016. The increase is attributable to $1.1 million in shareholder noncash expense for the issuance of certain warrants, $84,000 in insurance expenses and $65,000 in legal expenses, offset by decreases of $99,000 in general and administrative expenses allocated to us by BioTime, $84,000 in consulting expenses, and $79,000 in transfer agent, stock listing and SEC filing expenses. Sales and marketing expenses Sales and marketing expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased in comparison to the comparable period in 2016 as we prepare for the commercial launch of our lung cancer diagnostic test. The increase was attributable to $194,000 in consulting expenses, $152,000 in salaries and payroll related expenses and $50,000 in marketing expenses. Income taxes Due to our losses incurred for all periods presented, we did not record any provision or benefit for income taxes for any period presented. A valuation allowance will be provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. OncoCyte established a full valuation allowance for all periods presented due to the uncertainty of realizing future tax benefits from its net operating loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2017, we had $11.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and held BioTime common shares as available-for-sale securities valued at $1.6 million. Since inception, we have financed our operations through the sale of our common stock and warrants to our shareholders, including BioTime, loans from BioTime and other BioTime affiliates, warrant exercises, a bank loan, and sales of BioTime common shares that we hold as available-for-sale securities. We have incurred operating losses and negative cash flows since inception, and had an accumulated deficit of $40.0 million as March 31, 2017. We plan to continue to invest significant resources in research and development in the field of molecular cancer diagnostics. We expect to continue to incur operating losses and negative cash flows. If results of our research and development efforts, including the results of CLIA and validity studies of our lung cancer test, are successful to the point where we believe that a commercial product can be launched successfully, then additional capital will be required to continue to develop a sales and marketing team and to launch our first diagnostic test. OncoCyte will also need to raise additional capital in subsequent years to develop and launch additional diagnostic tests, for working capital, and for other expenses until such time as it is able to generate sufficient revenues from the commercialization of its diagnostic tests to finance its operations. The unavailability or inadequacy of financing or revenues to meet future capital needs could force us to modify, curtail, delay, or suspend some or all aspects of our planned operations. Sales of additional equity securities could result in the dilution of the interests of our shareholders. We cannot assure that adequate financing will be available on favorable terms, if at all. We believe we have sufficient cash, cash equivalents, available for sale securities and working capital to carry out our current operations through at least twelve months from the issuance date of the financial statements included elsewhere in this report, but we will need to raise additional capital if we determine to commercialize our lung cancer test during that time frame. Cash used in operations During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, our total research and development expenses were $1.8 million and $1.7 million, respectively, our general and administrative expenses were $2.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively, and our sales and marketing expenses were $655,000 and $228,000, respectively. Net loss for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 amounted to $4.7 million and $2.9 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities during these periods amounted to $3.3 million and $2.2 million, respectively. The amount by which our net loss exceeded net cash used in our operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2107 is primarily due to the following noncash items: a $1.1 million noncash charge related to warrants issued to certain investors as an inducement to exercise previously issued warrants, stock-based compensation of $350,000, $159,000 loss on sales of BioTime shares held as available-for-sale securities, and $128,000 in depreciation and amortization expenses. Changes in working capital amounted to an approximate $310,000 of additional use of cash. Cash provided by or used in investing activities During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, there was $16,000 and $15,000, respectively, in cash payments for purchases of machinery and equipment as we principally utilized capital lease financing to acquire equipment. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we sold 141,844 shares of BioTime stock we hold as available-for-sale securities with net proceeds to us of $502,000, which we used to pay down amounts owed to BioTime and affiliates. Under the provisions of the Loan Agreement discussed in Note 5 to our financial statements, we can only use the proceeds from sale of BioTime shares to pay amounts owed to BioTime and affiliates. Cash provided by financing activities During the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we received $16,000 and $42,000, respectively, in cash from the exercise of stock options. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, certain investors exercised 625,000 warrants at an exercise price of $3.25 per warrant for total exercise proceeds to us of $2.0 million, and we borrowed $2.0 million from the Bank. We used $47,000 to pay down capital lease obligations during the first quarter of 2017. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we did not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined in Item 303(a)(4)(ii) of SEC Regulation S-K.

OCX,"ALAMEDA, Calif., Mar 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OncoCyte Corporation (nyse american:OCX), a developer of novel, non-invasive liquid biopsy tests for the early detection of cancer, today provided an update on the development and commercial launch timeline of DetermaVu(TM), its liquid biopsy lung cancer diagnostic test. As reported in November 2017, during the process of running initial samples for the Clinical Validation Study inconsistent analytic results were observed by OncoCyte's technical team. OncoCyte determined that this was caused by a variance in the lots of consumables used in the sample-processing system that analyzes blood samples for markers that may indicate whether lung nodules found in patients are benign or suspicious. OncoCyte has been actively engaged with NanoString to more completely understand the issues that have delayed the DetermaVu(TM) validation study. The work with NanoString is ongoing. The work to date continues to support OncoCyte's conclusion that the previous studies of DetermaVu(TM) were not impacted by this consumables issue and the positive results reported previously have not changed. In addition to assessing the NanoString platform's commercial applicability, OncoCyte is actively evaluating alternative assay platforms for use with its molecular biology diagnostic testing. OncoCyte is announcing the encouraging initial results of its initial clinical sample feasibility study on the Illumina Sequencing platform. The Illumina platform is a market-leading platform for molecular biology testing in the clinical Laboratory Developed Test (LDT) space. While further testing is needed, OncoCyte's initial results indicate that the Illumina platform could provide consistent and robust support for the further clinical development studies that are necessary for the commercialization of DetermaVu(TM). Lyndal Hesterberg, OncoCyte's Senior Vice President of Research and Development, stated, ""The initial feasibility results on an established clinical platform may provide OncoCyte with an alternative path to clinical validation and commercial launch of the DetermaVu(TM) product in 2018. We will be pursuing the next steps to further assess the Illumina platform, along with other commercially established clinical molecular testing platforms, and we are encouraged by the results of this initial feasibility study."" OncoCyte has also identified ways that potentially may enhance the lung cancer signal identified by DetermaVu(TM) and has incorporated this approach into a revised algorithm. This revised algorithm was tested on about 60 clinical samples and resulted in accuracy (as measured by Area Under the Curve (AUC) data) equivalent or superior to previously reported results, although the error bar or potential range of results from this small sample set is wide and the results must be confirmed in a larger sample set. Because of these developments, OncoCyte is extending its evaluation of the commercial molecular diagnostic platforms by doing a follow-on study utilizing a larger set of clinical samples. The Company expects to complete the process during the second quarter of 2018. After concluding this process, data will be available to determine which platform delivers the most accurate, consistent and robust test results while maintaining a reasonable cost of goods. The Company then intends to complete product development on the selected platform by carrying out an R&D Validation Study followed by an Analytical Validation Study. If these studies are successfully completed, OncoCyte intends to conduct a Clinical Validation Study. Clinical validation is the final step prior to commercial launch, which is still anticipated during 2018. OncoCyte has collected all the samples necessary for carrying out all these studies. ""The results from our recent evaluation of commercially available molecular testing platforms support our continued confidence in DetermaVu(TM) as a confirmatory test for the diagnosis of early stage lung cancer,"" commented William Annett, President and Chief Executive Officer. About DetermaVu(TM) DetermaVu(TM) is OncoCyte's confirmatory, non-invasive, liquid biopsy test intended to facilitate clinical decision making in lung cancer diagnosis. DetermaVu(TM) is being developed as an intermediate step to confirm the absence of cancer between imaging modalities (LDCTs) detecting suspicious lung nodules and downstream invasive procedures that determine if the nodules are malignant. DetermaVu(TM) is a trademark of OncoCyte Corporation.

OCX,"ALAMEDA, Calif., Dec 01, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OncoCyte Corporation (nyse american:OCX), a developer of novel, non-invasive liquid biopsy tests for the early detection of cancer, will present data from its most recent breast cancer diagnostic study during a poster session at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) on December 7, 2017. The SABCS will take place at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas, from December 5-9, 2017. The data to be presented are from the Company's NICE-BC (Non-Invasive Confirmatory dEtection (of) Breast Cancer follow-on study. The data confirm the findings from OncoCyte's previous breast cancer study, which were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December 2016. In the earlier study, the 15-marker model resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 76%. Given this level of accuracy, and subject to successful completion of further R&D and clinical studies, OncoCyte's novel panel of serum protein biomarkers may become the foundation of a highly accurate, non-invasive breast cancer diagnostic test. The AUC of a test is a measure that combines sensitivity and specificity to express its total accuracy, with 1.0 being perfect accuracy and 0.50 being a random result. Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of test performance, with sensitivity measuring the percentage of malignant lumps or masses that are identified correctly by the test and specificity measuring the percentage of benign lumps or masses correctly identified. ""We look forward to reporting data from our breast cancer diagnostic development program at this prestigious conference,"" said William Annett, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The data from our breast cancer studies are compelling and we look forward to continuing to advance the development program in 2018. We believe our test would address a significant unmet need by reducing the number of unnecessary invasive breast biopsies and lowering the financial burden to the healthcare system."" The data from the NICE-BC study will be presented at SABCS 2017 by Philip McQuary, Ph.D., Director, Product Development, at OncoCyte.       Abstract Title: Assessment of an immune response panel of serum protein biomarkers for the non-invasive detection of breast cancer   Poster Session: 2 (P2-02-03)   Session Title: Detection/Diagnosis: Circulating Markers   Session Date: December 7, 2017   Session Time: 7:00 am CT - 9:00 am CT     The current standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis - annual or biannual mammogram screenings - does not meet the needs of large populations of women for whom mammography alone is not sufficient. These populations include women with dense breast tissue, genetic mutations (BRCA), a family history of breast cancer, or those who have suspicious mammogram screening results (BIRADs 3 or 4). The Company's non-invasive liquid biopsy breast cancer diagnostic is intended to be a confirmatory, post-mammogram test that would address the needs of some of these populations, thereby reducing the number of patients subjected to invasive procedures. According to published reports, there are about 39 million mammograms performed annually in the U.S., resulting in 1.6 million breast biopsies per year. Of these, only 260,000 (16%) result in a cancer diagnosis. The large number of suspicious findings in diagnostic mammograms leads to a significant amount of unnecessary invasive follow-up procedures. The financial burden to the healthcare system imposed by the follow-up testing of false-positive mammograms and breast cancer over-diagnosis is estimated to be $4 billion a year. About Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among US women. Current screening guidelines set forth by the American Cancer Society recommend screening mammography for the early detection of breast cancer in women at average risk. Specifically, guidelines call for annual mammography for asymptomatic women age 45 to 54 and once every two years for women age 55 and older. Suspicious screening mammograms are generally followed up with a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes by an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Image) or an ultrasound. Ultimately, suspicious findings unresolved by imaging typically result in the recommendation of a breast biopsy.

OCX,"ALAMEDA, Calif., Nov 14, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OncoCyte Corporation (nyse american:OCX), a developer of novel, non-invasive tests for the early detection of cancer, today reported financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, and provided an update on the Clinical Validation Study of DetermaVu(TM), the Company's liquid biopsy lung cancer diagnostic test. ""We continued to make important progress during the third quarter, including the successful completion of the Analytical Validation Study of DetermaVu(TM) and certification of our CLIA laboratory,"" said William Annett, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""The consistent and significantly positive data that we have demonstrated and the numerous presentations highlighting the results are raising awareness of the potential benefits of DetermaVu(TM) in the early diagnosis of lung cancer."" Recent Developments Successfully completed the Analytical Validation and CLIA Lab Validation studies of OncoCyte's liquid biopsy lung cancer diagnostic test, confirming data that was reported in May at the American Thoracic Society 2017 International Conference (ATS), which demonstrated sensitivity of 95%, specificity of 73%, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.92, Received Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments (CLIA) certification of registration from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), Dr. Anil Vachani, an Associate Professor of Medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania and the Philadelphia Veteran's Administration Medical Center, reported data on DetermaVu(TM) at the CHEST Annual Meeting 2017 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, and Data from the Company's most recent breast cancer diagnostic study has been selected for presentation in a poster session at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), being held from December 5-9, 2017. Clinical Validation Study Update and Commercial Launch Plans The Clinical Validation Study for DetermaVu(TM) is the final development step prior to commercial launch. This step involves assaying approximately 300 blinded prospectively collected samples to assess the performance of the full diagnostic system against clinically confirmed diagnoses. During the process of running initial samples for the Clinical Validation Study, inconsistent analytic results were observed by OncoCyte's technical team. OncoCyte believes this was caused by a variance in a recently received lot of consumables used in the processing system that analyzes blood samples for the genetic markers that indicate whether lung nodules found in patients are benign or suspicious. To address this issue, OncoCyte has ordered and is waiting to receive new lots of consumables from the supplier. Once the new consumables are received, OncoCyte will conduct internal quality control procedures to ensure that they meet OncoCyte's requirements. Upon confirming that the new consumables will allow the analytic devices to generate data with the consistency and precision required for DetermaVu(TM), OncoCyte will initiate the Clinical Validation Study. Due to the time required for these steps, OncoCyte now anticipates that completion of the Clinical Validation Study necessary for the commercial launch of DetermaVu(TM) will be delayed into 2018, depending on the successful rectification of the causes of the inconsistent analytic results. OncoCyte has only observed this issue in the recent lot of consumables. Earlier studies were conducted using different lots of consumables where this issue was not observed. Consequently, the previous studies were not impacted by this issue and the positive results reported to date have not changed. Mr. Annett commented, ""We remain confident in the positive results reported to date and believe that the clinical use of DetermaVu(TM) can make an important contribution to the management of lung cancer nodules and help to improve therapeutic outcomes for lung cancer patients."" Breast Cancer Diagnostic Update Data from the Company's most recent breast cancer diagnostic study has been selected for presentation in a poster session at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS), which is being held from December 5-9, 2017. The data to be presented are from the Company's NICE-BC (Non-Invasive Confirmatory dEtection (of) Breast Cancer follow-on study. Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results For the quarter ended September 30, 2017, OncoCyte incurred a net loss of $6.9 million, or ($0.22) per share, compared to a net loss of $2.6 million, or ($0.10) per share, in the third quarter of 2016. Operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017, were $6.8 million, as reported, and were $3.2 million, on an as adjusted basis. Research and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, were $1.8 million compared to $1.4 million for the same period in 2016. The increase in research and development expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017, of $0.4 million compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016, is primarily attributable to increases in salaries and compensation related expenses, development expenses primarily for our lung cancer test and stock-based compensation expenses. General and administrative expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased by $3.2 million in comparison to the comparable period in 2016. The increase is mainly attributable to $3.0 million in shareholder noncash expense for the issuance of warrants to certain investors to exercise warrants, $0.1 million in recruiting and hiring expenses and $0.1 million in stock based compensation expenses. At September 30, 2017, OncoCyte had cash and cash equivalents of $11.0 million and available-for-sale securities valued at $1.0 million. Nine Month 2017 Financial Results The net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, was $15.4 million, or ($0.52) per share, compared to $8.1 million, or ($0.31) per share, in the first nine months of 2016. Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, were $15.0 million, as reported, and were $9.3 million on an as adjusted basis. Research and development expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, were $5.7 million compared with $4.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in research and development expenses of $1.4 million is primarily attributable to increases in salaries and payroll related expenses, clinical trial expenses for OncoCyte's lung cancer test, DetermaVu(TM), stock based compensation expenses, charges to OncoCyte by BioTime for shared services expenses, which includes facilities, insurance and other indirect expense, and services and development expenses primarily for DetermaVu(TM). The increases were offset by a decrease in outside services expenses and consulting fees. General and administrative expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased by $4.3 million in comparison to the comparable period in 2016. The increase is mainly attributable to $4.1 million in noncash expense for the issuance of warrants to certain investors who exercised warrants, and $0.2 million in insurance expense.

OCX,"ALAMEDA, Calif., Sep 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OncoCyte Corporation (nyse american:OCX), a developer of novel, non-invasive, blood-based liquid biopsy tests to assist in the early detection of cancer, announced today that its CLIA laboratory has successfully completed a rigorous validation study of DetermaVu(TM), OncoCyte's diagnostic test for lung cancer. In this study, OncoCyte assayed approximately 120 samples previously tested in its 299-patient study presented at the American Thoracic Society conference in May 2017, with the goal of demonstrating that OncoCyte's new clinical laboratory provides the same results on clinical samples as those obtained in its R&D lab. The results met all performance criteria, demonstrating the accuracy and robustness of the assay as performed in the Company's CLIA laboratory. The CLIA lab validation study included specific protocols to confirm the accuracy, reproducibility, and precision/repeatability of DetermaVu(TM). ""The laboratory staff and procedures in place in the clinical laboratory have been confirmed to provide accurate, reliable, consistent and reproducible results,"" said William Seltzer, PhD, FACMG, VP of Clinical Services and the Laboratory Director for OncoCyte. ""The results were consistent with the positive data reported at the American Thoracic Society 2017 International Conference, and have enabled us to initiate our Clinical Validation Study, the final step prior to the commercial launch of DetermaVu(TM)."" The Clinical Validation Study has now begun and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2017. In this study, approximately 300 new blinded blood samples, which have been prospectively collected will be assayed in the CLIA lab using DetermaVu(TM). The performance of the test will be assessed against the clinical diagnosis of the patients from whom the samples were collected. If the Clinical Validation Study is successful and the results meet commercial requirements, OncoCyte will commence the commercial launch of DetermaVu(TM). ""Successful completion of the CLIA Lab Validation Study is another important step toward launching DetermaVu(TM),"" said William Annett, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We plan to complete the ongoing Clinical Validation Study in the fourth quarter."" OncoCyte believes that widespread utilization of DetermaVu(TM) could result in a substantial reduction in the number of unnecessary, expensive lung biopsies performed annually in the U.S., with a corresponding reduction in the surgical risk to patients undergoing biopsy procedures. Broad use of DetermaVu(TM) would result in a fundamental advancement in the diagnosis of suspicious lung nodules by allowing physicians to determine more accurately which patients need biopsies and which patients only need follow-up imaging. The Company estimates that approximately 1.4 million patients annually in the U.S. could benefit from the DetermaVu(TM) test. Depending on market penetration and reimbursable pricing, this could translate into a market opportunity of up to $4.7 billion annually. About OncoCyte Corporation OncoCyte is focused on the development and commercialization of novel, non-invasive blood and urine (""liquid biopsy"") diagnostic tests for the early detection of cancer to improve health outcomes through earlier diagnoses, to reduce the cost of care through the avoidance of more costly diagnostic procedures, including invasive biopsy and cystoscopic procedures, and to improve the quality of life for cancer patients. While current biopsy tests use invasive surgical procedures to provide tissue samples in order to determine if a tumor is benign or malignant, OncoCyte is developing a next generation of diagnostic tests that will be based on liquid biopsies using blood or urine samples. OncoCyte's pipeline products are intended to be confirmatory diagnostics for detecting lung, breast and bladder cancer. OncoCyte's diagnostic tests are being developed using proprietary sets of genetic and protein markers that differentially express in specific types of cancer.

OCX,"ALAMEDA, Calif., Sep 25, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- BioTime, Inc. (nyse american:BTX), a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing products addressing degenerative diseases, announced today that its Board of Directors has approved a distribution of some or all of the shares of AgeX Therapeutics, Inc. owned by BioTime to BioTime’s shareholders. The Board also authorized management to work with investment banks and other financial institutions to finalize and implement the strategy for taking AgeX public, which may include a tax-free distribution. “Asterias BioTherapeutics and OncoCyte Corporation, two companies founded by BioTime, were successfully transitioned into independent, publicly-traded companies that created significant value for BioTime and its shareholders,” said Alfred Kingsley, BioTime’s Chairman of the Board. “We believe the formation and independent funding of AgeX, and a subsequent distribution to BioTime shareholders, will similarly unlock the significant value of the previously embedded BioTime assets related to the treatment of aging and age-related diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, heart disease, stroke and cancer.” AgeX Therapeutics focuses on technologies relating to cellular immortality and the regenerative biology of aging. Aging and age-related diseases have recently garnered significant investor interest, as evidenced by the formation of companies such as Calico, Human Longevity Inc., Unity Biotechnology, and Samumed, as well as others. These companies have attracted major financial supporters, many of whose investments were made at multibillion-dollar market valuations. AgeX’s initial investors similarly include institutions and accomplished business leaders, whose support creates a foundation for the company’s potential future success. AgeX closed its initial $10 million equity financing in August of 2017 with a post-money valuation of approximately $68 million. BioTime currently owns approximately 85% of the outstanding shares of AgeX, with a post-money valuation of approximately $58 million, or 50 cents per BioTime share. The equity financing is expected to fund AgeX’s general operations and product development well into 2019, while saving BioTime more than $5 million annually on these programs and associated operational expenses. Building on the recent success of the formation, funding and launch of AgeX, BioTime’s management and Board are now exploring all options for making AgeX a publicly-traded company, including a potential tax-free distribution of all AgeX shares to BioTime shareholders. Once BioTime’s management completes its discussions with investment banks and other financial firms, and its analysis of remaining tax, legal, commercial and regulatory issues, BioTime will announce further details of the resulting plan. About AgeX Therapeutics AgeX Therapeutics, Inc., a subsidiary of BioTime, Inc. (nyse american:BTX), is a biotechnology company applying technology relating to cellular immortality and regenerative biology to aging and age-related diseases. The company has three initial areas of product development: pluripotent stem cell-derived brown adipocytes (AGEX-BAT1); vascular progenitors (AGEX-VASC1); and induced Tissue Regeneration (iTR). Initial planned indications for these products are Type 2 diabetes, cardiac ischemia, and cancer, respectively. More information on AgeX can be found on the company’s website at www.agexinc.com. About BioTime, Inc. BioTime is a late stage clinical biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing products addressing degenerative diseases.

OCX,"ALAMEDA, Calif., Sep 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OncoCyte Corporation (nyse american:OCX), a developer of novel, non-invasive blood-based liquid biopsy tests to assist in the early detection of cancer, announced today positive final results from the Analytical Validation Study of its liquid biopsy lung cancer diagnostic test, DetermaVU(TM). The data were presented by Philip McQuary Ph.D., Director of Product Development, OncoCyte Corporation, at the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), in Chicago. The accuracy results of the Analytical Validation Study reported today demonstrate sensitivity of 94.4%, specificity of 67.5% and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93, which means that 93 percent of the samples tested during the Analytical Validation were correctly diagnosed. These data are consistent with the data reported in May at the American Thoracic Society 2017 International Conference. Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of test performance, with sensitivity measuring the percentage of malignant nodules that are identified correctly by the test and specificity measuring the percentage of benign nodules correctly identified. The AUC of a test is a measure of overall global accuracy that combines sensitivity and specificity, with 1.0 being perfect accuracy and 0.50 being a random result. The score of 0.93 reported at the recent IASLC meeting means that 93 percent of the samples were correctly identified. The next step in the process leading to commercial launch of DetermaVu is a CLIA Validation study, which is now underway and expected to be completed in the third quarter of this year. If the CLIA Validation study is successful, the final step will be a Clinical Validation study, which is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of this year. If the Clinical Validation study is successful, OncoCyte plans to launch DetermaVu. OncoCyte believes that at launch DetermaVu will be the only commercially available liquid biopsy lung cancer product in what the Company estimates is an up to $4.7 billion annual market opportunity in the U.S. ""The new data seen in the Analytical Validation Study provide further evidence of the reliability of the DetermaVu assay system in identifying cancerous nodules,"" stated Lyndal Hesterberg, Ph.D., Senior Vice President, Research and Development. ""These data give support our belief that physicians will be able to use DetermaVu with confidence in their clinical practice to help patients make more informed treatment decisions."" William Annett, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented, ""We are excited that the results reported at the IASLC conference confirm the positive data reported in May at the American Thoracic Society meeting. If our upcoming Clinical Validation study is successful, we intend to commercialize DetermaVu in the fourth quarter of 2017."" Analytical Validation The studies required for Analytical Validation have been established in the CLSI (Clinical Lab Standards Institute) Guidelines. These guidelines cover the testing for such matters as limits of quantitation, precision, reproducibility, and interfering substances. OncoCyte has completed all of these studies successfully. The new Analytical Validation data support expectations that the test's performance will continue to be robust. The completion of the study establishes the performance characteristics of OncoCyte's lung cancer diagnostic test and, if the Clinical Validation studies are successful, will allow for industrial-scale operations under real world conditions. OncoCyte believes that DetermaVu could result in a substantial reduction in the number of unnecessary, expensive lung biopsies performed annually in the U.S., thereby representing a fundamental advancement in the more accurate diagnosis of suspicious lung nodules by allowing physicians to determine which patients need biopsies versus those who may only need follow-up imaging. The Company estimates that approximately 1.4 million patients annually in the U.S. could benefit from the test. Depending on market penetration and reimbursable pricing, this could translate into a market opportunity of up to $4.7 billion annually. Clinical Validation Stage Underway The final stage of development following the now completed Analytical Validation Study is Clinical Validation. This stage consists of two distinct sets of studies that will be carried out in OncoCyte's new CLIA approved clinical laboratory. The first step is CLIA Lab Validation. In this study, OncoCyte will assay approximately 120 samples previously tested in the 299-patient study presented at the ATS meeting, with the goal of demonstrating that OncoCyte's new clinical laboratory provides the same results on clinical samples as those obtained in OncoCyte's R&D lab. This study is underway. Upon successful completion of the CLIA Lab Validation study, the second step will be two CLIA Lab Clinical Validation studies. In these studies, OncoCyte will perform assays on blinded prospectively collected samples to assess the performance of the full diagnostic system against clinically confirmed diagnoses. OncoCyte will perform Clinical Validation on two sets of samples. The first study will consist of approximately 300 samples. If the results of the study are consistent with results to date, OncoCyte will launch DetermaVu. The second study will be conducted post-launch on approximately 200 additional samples to provide additional data to increase the likelihood that physicians will adopt the test and that insurance companies and Medicare will provide reimbursement coverage for the test.

OCX,"ALAMEDA, Calif., Sep 11, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OncoCyte Corporation (nyse american:OCX), a developer of novel, non-invasive liquid biopsy tests for the early detection of cancer, today announced that data from its most recent breast cancer diagnostic study has been selected for presentation in a poster session at the 2017 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS). The SABCS will take place at the Henry B. Gonzalez Convention Center in San Antonio, Texas, from December 5-9, 2017. The data to be presented are from the Company's NICE-BC (Non-Invasive Confirmatory dEtection (of) Breast Cancer follow-on study. The data confirm the findings from OncoCyte's previous breast cancer study, which were presented at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (SABCS) in December 2016. In the earlier study, the 15-marker model resulted in an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.92 with a sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 76%. Given this level of accuracy, and subject to successful completion of further R&D and clinical studies, OncoCyte's novel panel of serum protein biomarkers may become the foundation of a highly accurate, non-invasive breast cancer diagnostic test. The AUC of a test is a measure that combines sensitivity and specificity to express its total accuracy, with 1.0 being perfect accuracy and 0.50 being a random result. Sensitivity and specificity are statistical measures of test performance, with sensitivity measuring the percentage of malignant lumps or masses that are identified correctly by the test and specificity measuring the percentage of benign lumps or masses correctly identified. ""The presentation of data from our ongoing breast cancer diagnostic studies is another important step in the development of our non-invasive breast cancer diagnostic test,"" said William Annett, President and Chief Executive Officer. ""There is a significant unmet need for a confirmatory breast cancer test that would reduce the number of unnecessary invasive biopsies and lower the financial burden to the healthcare system. We look forward to continued development of this important program."" The data from the NICE-BC study will be presented at SABCS 2017 by Philip McQuary, Ph.D., Director of Product Development at OncoCyte. Abstract Title: Assessment of an immune response panel of serum protein biomarkers for the non-invasive detection of breast cancer Poster Session: 4 Session Title: Detection/Diagnosis: Circulating Markers Session Date: December 7, 2017 Session Time: 7:00 am CT - 9:00 am CT The current standard of care for breast cancer diagnosis - annual or biannual mammogram screenings - does not meet the needs of large populations of women for whom mammography alone is not sufficient. These populations include women with dense breast tissue, genetic mutations (BRCA), a family history of breast cancer, or those who have suspicious mammogram screening results (BIRADs 3 or 4). The Company's non-invasive liquid biopsy breast cancer diagnostic is intended to be a confirmatory, post-mammogram test that would address the needs of some of these populations, thereby reducing the number of patients subjected to invasive procedures. According to published reports, there are about 39 million mammograms performed annually in the U.S., resulting in 1.6 million breast biopsies per year. Of these, only 260,000 (16%) result in a cancer diagnosis. The large number of suspicious findings in diagnostic mammograms leads to a significant amount of unnecessary invasive follow-up procedures. The financial burden to the healthcare system imposed by the follow-up testing of false-positive mammograms and breast cancer over-diagnosis is estimated to be $4 billion a year. About Breast Cancer Breast cancer is the second most common cancer among US women. Current screening guidelines set forth by the American Cancer Society recommend screening mammography for the early detection of breast cancer in women at average risk. Specifically, guidelines call for annual mammography for asymptomatic women age 45 to 54 and once every two years for women age 55 and older. Suspicious screening mammograms are generally followed up with a diagnostic mammogram and sometimes by an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Image) or an ultrasound. Ultimately, suspicious findings unresolved by imaging typically result in the recommendation of a breast biopsy. About OncoCyte Corporation OncoCyte is focused on the development and commercialization of novel, non-invasive blood and urine (""liquid biopsy"") diagnostic tests for the early detection of cancer to improve health outcomes through earlier diagnoses, to reduce the cost of care through the avoidance of more costly diagnostic procedures, including invasive biopsy and cystoscopic procedures, and to improve the quality of life for cancer patients. While current biopsy tests use invasive surgical procedures to provide tissue samples in order to determine if a tumor is benign or malignant, OncoCyte is developing a next generation of diagnostic tests that will be based on liquid biopsies using blood or urine samples. OncoCyte's pipeline products are intended to be confirmatory diagnostics for detecting lung, breast and bladder cancer. OncoCyte's diagnostic tests are being developed using proprietary sets of genetic and protein markers that differentially express in specific types of cancer.

OCX,"ALAMEDA, Calif., Sep 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OncoCyte Corporation (nyse american:OCX), a developer of novel, non-invasive tests for the early detection of cancer, today announced that its clinical laboratory facility located in Alameda, California, has received Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendments (CLIA) certification of registration from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). In addition, OncoCyte's laboratory has passed inspection by the California Department of Public Health and is now fully licensed and operational. OncoCyte plans to use its CLIA-certified laboratory to commercialize proprietary cancer diagnostic tests. The Company expects to launch its first assay, DetermaVu(TM), a confirmatory lung cancer diagnostic, in the fourth quarter of 2017, assuming successful completion of CLIA Validation and Clinical Validation studies. OncoCyte estimates that a $4.7 billion annual market could develop in the U.S. for confirmatory lung cancer liquid biopsy tests, depending on market penetration and reimbursable pricing. ""Having our CLIA laboratory become operational marks the beginning of our commercial activities in the U.S., a key driver of our long-term success. The receipt of CLIA certification is a testament to the dedication and proficiency of our operations team in Alameda and I am grateful for the team members' tireless efforts in achieving this important milestone,"" said Bill Annett, President and CEO. ""The demand for molecular diagnostic testing for cancer is growing rapidly and CLIA certification of our laboratory positions OncoCyte to enter this exciting emerging field."" Mr. Annett continued, ""We believe DetermaVu(TM) will aid physicians in the early diagnosis of lung cancer and in a majority of cases eliminate the need for expensive, invasive lung biopsies. We expect that a reduction in the number of lung biopsies performed annually, coupled with improvements in treatment at an early stage of disease, could lead to a significant reduction in the cost burden to the healthcare system while improving the survival rate of lung cancer patients."" About CLIA Under CLIA, a laboratory is defined as any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment of, or assessment of health of human beings. CLIA requires that the Company holds a certificate applicable to the complexity of the categories of testing performed and that compliance with certain standards. CLIA further regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they comply with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality and proficiency testing requirements intended to ensure that the clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable and timely. CLIA certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to be reimbursed for services provided to state and federal health care program beneficiaries.
