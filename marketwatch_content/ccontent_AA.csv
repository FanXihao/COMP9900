AA,"U.S. stocks closed sharply higher Thursday, with major indexes climbing 1% in a broad rally that had nearly every sector participate in the gains and post strong weekly advances. Even so, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index broke a lengthy string of quarterly gains, and also closed down for the month of March. See: Which markets are closed on Good Friday? What are the main benchmarks doing? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% rose 309 points, or 1.2%, to 24,143. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% rose 37 points to 2,642, a gain of 1.4%. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64% rose 114 points, or 1.6%, to 7,063. The day was the latest example of pronounced market moves. For the week, the Dow rose 2.7%, while the S&P added 2.1% and the Nasdaq was up 1%. For the month of March, all three saw steep declines, with the Dow off 3.5%, the S&P 500 off 2.7% and the Nasdaq off 2.9% in its biggest monthly drop since January 2016. In the first quarter, during which time the Dow and S&P fell into correction territory, the Dow fell 2.3% and the S&P lost 1.2%. Both ended nine-quarter streaks of gains; for the Dow, that represented its longest such streak since 1997. Read: The Dow’s streak of quarterly gains has ended at nine The Nasdaq gained 2.3% in the first quarter, its seventh-straight quarterly gain. What’s driving markets? The day’s gains were broad-based, with 10 of the 11 primary S&P 500 sectors closing higher on the day. The biggest gainer was tech, up 2.2%. Investor confidence in tech stocks has been shaken in recent sessions, as big-name companies grappled with a variety of troubles. Facebook Inc. FB, +4.42%  is dealing with a backlash over how it has managed user data, while Tesla Inc. TSLA, +3.24% faces an investigation of a fatal crash of one of the company’s electric cars in California last week. However, those issues showed some signs of easing in the final trading day of the quarter, with some of the market’s biggest trading favorites resuming their uptrend. “Window dressing,” or portfolio managers adding some of the quarter’s top-performing names to improve the appearance of their fund, was seen as a contributing factor behind the rebound in tech, although quantifying the impact is difficult.

Also: Tech stocks face a ‘dumpster fire’—but here’s how that could be bullish Beyond tech, markets were also supported by a 2.2% rise in energy stocks. Materials, industrials, and financials also saw gains of at least 1% on the day. What are strategists saying? “This is the last day of the quarter, so there’s some standard window dressing going on. Beyond that, I don’t think markets look expensive at these levels, especially if rates don’t go up in a quick fashion,” said Charlie Smith, chief investment officer at Pittsburgh-based Fort Pitt Capital Group. Steven Wieting, global chief investment strategist at Citi Private Bank, suggested the recent selloff in technology stocks had been overdone. “It is our view that IT firms that maintain technological leadership are exactly the firms that outperform over the longer run. The current valuation and fundamental backdrop [of the tech sector] is very different from 1999” in the dot-com era, he wrote. “Shares that sell off in a sector rotation from tech could prove strong, long-term investment opportunities.” Check out: Fed mistakes could spark ‘unusually fast’ bear market, ‘lost decade’ for stocks Which stocks are in focus?

AA,"President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs on aluminum and steel imports is a near-term credit positive for steel producers, but it will hurt steel-consuming manufacturers and their workers, who greatly outnumber steelworkers, Moody’s Investors Service said Friday. There are about 140,000 steelworkers in the U.S., according to the American Iron & Steel Institute, and about 6.5 million workers in steel-consuming manufacturers, Moody’s analysts wrote in reports published Friday. “Workers in these consuming sectors will likely be hurt by higher steel prices,” they said. “Domestic manufacturers could also eventually switch to importing whole components of finished products that are made from steel to reduce their product costs, which would lead to reduced domestic steel demand in the long term.” Trump said Thursday he would impose a 25% tariff on steel imports and a 10% tariff on aluminum. The news sent stocks tumbling, as investors braced for the possibility of a trade war. The tariffs are likely to boost prices of both metals in the U.S., weighing on all those manufacturers that need them as raw materials. Read now: Here’s why the Dow is taking the Trump tariffs so hard Also: Trump’s tariffs mean higher prices — and maybe even beer in plastic bags Raw-material prices have already been rising in response to growing demand. Diversified industrial companies are currently enjoying rising sales and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) growth, thanks to the strong global economy, which has helped companies exposed to commodities dig their way out of a prolonged trough. That will help offset any impact from rising input costs, said Moody’s. However, “protectionist trade policies, including tariffs on raw-material imports, could exacerbate these inflationary pressures, running the risk of tighter margins and possible supply-chain disruptions in the manufacturing sector,” said the agency. See: What history teaches us about who wins in trade wars Also: Trump goes rogue, finally becoming the president he said he’d be How we got here: A history of U.S. steel wars before Trump The industries most at risk are equipment makers and component suppliers in the aerospace and transportation and automotive sectors. These include aluminum parts makers that are suppliers to the aerospace and car sectors, as well as steel parts makers selling to sectors such as railroads, trucking, energy and construction. Companies that supply parts to those sectors include Visteon Corp. VC, +2.18% , Delphi Technologies PLC DLPH, +1.04% , Cummins Inc. CMI, +1.52% , Honeywell Inc. HON, +0.87% , United Technologies Co. UTX, +1.10% , Johnson Controls Inc. JCI, +2.77% , Lear Corp. LEA, +3.01% , Dana Holding Corp., BorgWarner Inc. BWA, +3.25% , Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co. GT, +0.83% and Alcoa Corp. AA, +1.22%  . The bigger components makers often have provisions in their supply contracts that allow them to pass through rising raw-material costs, but smaller companies operating in highly competitive and fragmented markets will likely struggle. “Although contractual mechanisms will help many manufacturers, we nonetheless expect that even well-protected companies will have to contend with a lag between the time that input costs rise and customer prices can be reset,” said Moody’s. “During this brief period, margins will tighten, particularly where last-in-first-out (LIFO) inventory reporting is employed.“ Cash flow will shrink as companies increase working capital for more expensive inventory. Companies will have to raise prices, making it harder to compete in export markets, and possibly encouraging some companies to move part of their business overseas — at the cost of American jobs. “A possible workaround would be to increase foreign manufacturing and ship from the foreign location. This would require additional investment and time, but for those companies that had already considered expanding their foreign manufacturing base, the tariffs may make the decisions easier,” said the analysts.

AA,"Back when economists such as Paul Krugman and Mark Zandi feared that Donald Trump’s election would make markets sell-off en route to a recession, they typically argued that tax cuts would goose the economy early in Trump’s term, but protectionist trade policies would spoil the party in the end. Now we may get to see if they were right. President Trump, in his own haphazard way, announced Thursday that he plans to slap 25% tariffs on imported steel and 10% duties on aluminum. Trump’s announcement — which the White House scheduled, then suggested would be about something else, then finally went ahead with — comes amid a hairy few months on trade policy. U.S., Canadian and Mexican negotiators are working on a recast version of the North American Free Trade Agreement — just as Mexico’s president cancelled a state visit to Washington. Meanwhile, the administration is blocking mergers with Chinese companies in semiconductors and even money transfers, using a law designed to protect national security secrets to stall Chinese investment in U.S. assets that don’t involve bailing out Jared Kushner’s white-elephant Manhattan office tower. What should we make of this? First, the tariff announcement matters much more if it’s followed up by other moves on NAFTA, and China more generally, because steel and aluminum are only a small part of U.S. exports. Second, suppressing trade is hardly a magic bullet for metals companies such as Alcoa AA, +1.22% Nucor NUE, +2.98%  , and Steel Dynamics STLD, +3.56% In 2015 and 2016, when China’s ability to import products wobbled amid fears of a financial panic, U.S. stocks of exporters went down, including metals firms. Third, this is a lot like Trump’s efforts to prop up the coal industry being slaughtered by cheap natural gas and the downward surge of prices for renewable power. Primary metals manufacturing employs just 375,000 Americans (out of 154 million), and unemployment in that industry is a low 3.1%. As with the 51,800-job coal industry, the threat that cheap, allegedly dumped metals pose to employment is minor and the solution won’t work. ‘The worst possible nightmare for the economy.’ Economist Bernard Baumohl “It’s the worst possible nightmare for the economy,” said Economic Outlook Group chief economist Bernard Baumohl, with perhaps a touch of hyperbole. More expensive steel in the U.S raises costs for companies making cars, homes, office buildings and more — and could push inflation up above 3% by 2019 or 2020, he argues. “More workers in the U.S. make products that are made from steel, than make steel itself.” Zandi confirms that Trump is sticking to his 2016 script — a bit more slowly than he promised, and with moves that aren’t (yet) as big or grandiose as cancelling NAFTA or inviting a trade war with China. And still he thinks it will end badly. “It has taken him a year to get going, but directionally it is doing what he said he would do, and the economic impact of all this is also sticking to the script,’’ Zandi said in an e-mail. “Economic growth and stock market are getting a temporary boost, and inflation and interest rates are picking up. And if the script continues to hold, and odds are good that it will, a very weak economy or even recession will follow, probably in 2020.” How we got here: A history of U.S. steel wars before Trump How weak? For now, we can only guess. But here’s one way to think about it. In 2016 — when Trump himself was braying that the economy was only growing 1% (which was wrong) and that too-loose trade was the top reason — a trade shock hit the U.S. economy. Exporters were getting slammed; for example, Deere DE, +2.53%  , Caterpillar CAT, +1.53%  and even Alcoa were losing business to a rising U.S. dollar DXY, -0.15%  as well as customers in export markets who now had to worry about financial conditions as much as business conditions. The subsequent slowdown in exports took 0.4 percentage points off 2016 growth, Zandi says. That’s a decent starting point for thinking about the impact of Trump’s sanctions — and it could get worse if Trump follows up with NAFTA meddling and other shenanigans, messing with supply chains in the much larger automobile- and auto parts industries. “A trade deficit doesn’t subtract from growth — only a growing trade deficit subtracts from growth, and our trade deficit is about where it was over a decade ago,” Zandi said. “It could be disastrous if it our trading partners decide to respond in kind or worse.” A significant brake on economic growth, with more to come. Some reasons for an adverse impact include higher interest rates and inflation as less foreign capital moves to the U.S., said Richard Moody, chief economist at Regions Financial. Another is the 25,000 to 50,000 jobs Baumohl expects to see lost at companies that use steel and aluminum as inputs, and more pressure on the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, he adds. So Trump’s move doesn’t look like a recession-causer. But it does look like a significant brake on economic growth, with more to come. Fortunately for the country, Donald the Dullard is too dumb to understand he’s shooting his re-election chances in the foot in ways that will show up in 2019 and 2020.

AA,"Shares of steel and aluminum companies were taken for a wild ride Thursday, as on-again, off-again then on-again tariff-announcement hopes ended rather well, despite the negative effect on the broader market. Shares of steel and aluminum makers rose in early morning trade as investors anticipated an announcement from President Donald Trump regarding tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. Then a mid-morning report by CNBC that the Trump wouldn’t announce any tariffs caused sharp pullbacks in the shares, before they all started rallying again after Trump actually announced the tariff plans. Trumps said the U.S. would set tariffs of 25% for steel imports and 10% for aluminum imports.

U.S. Steel Corp.’s stock X, +4.92%  rallied as much as 8.4% in morning trade, then sold off to be up just 0.6% after the CNBC report, then shot up as much as 9.5% after the actual announcement. It has pared gains since, as fears that the tariffs would jack up raw materials prices and spark a trade war sent the broader stock market tumbling, but still closed up 5.8%. AK Steel Holding Corp. shares AKS, +5.84%  were up 11.6%, then up just 1.2%, then back up to 13.2%, before closing up 9.5%. Among aluminum makers, Alcoa Corp.’s stock AA, +1.22%  went from a 2.9% gain to a 0.5% loss, then back to a 2.9% gain before settling up 0.2%. Shares of Century Aluminum Co.

It closed up 4.0%. • Shares of Commercial Metals Co. CMC, +2.76%  rallied as much as 3.7%, then pared gains to be up just 1.1%, before rallying to a 6.2% gain before closing up 5.0%. Barclays analysts said that despite the fanfare, investors were expecting a little too much from the tariffs, as steel and aluminum imports account for only about 2% of total goods imported. “We expect the direct economic effects of anti-trade policies in these industries to be limited, given their small share in total goods imports,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients. Meanwhile, the broader market’s roller coaster ride didn’t end up as much fun for broader-market investors. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  climbed as much as 156.15 points in morning trade, then plunged as much as 586.64 points, before bouncing slightly to close down 420.22 points. See Market Snapshot. “Meanwhile, any inflationary impulse from higher tariffs depends on whether firms view the increase as permanent and if the current state of the business cycle would contribute to a high pass-through rate from tariffs to final goods,” Barclays analysts wrote. “However, we believe any pass-through to final goods prices is likely to be less than full and come with a lag.” How Trump could spark a global trade war over steel Still, shares of companies that use steel and aluminum to make their products took a hit with the rest of the market.

AA,"When it seems everyone is piling into an asset class, veteran investors typically believe it signals the end of a bull market or the end of an economic growth cycle. But Jim Brilliant, the manager of the highly rated CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund, believes the recent narrowing of the gap between high-yield bonds and Treasurys isn’t an ominous sign. Instead, he believes the improving word economy signals continued strength for bond prices and a change in the stock market, with money shifting from higher-growth stocks into slower-growth value stocks in the energy, materials and industrials sectors as commodity prices strengthen. This chart shows the gap, or spread, between the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. High Yield Index and 10-year U.S. Treasury notes: As you can see, the spread has narrowed quite a bit, to only 3.06 percentage points, on Jan. 13. Within the past two years, the spread between riskier junk-bond yields and safer 10-year Treasury yields has been over 6 percentage points at times. Spread compression and the warning “We are in an environment where high-yield spreads have compressed to where they were in 2007,” Brilliant said during a phone interview. That can be very alarming for those who recall all the market turmoil in 2008-2009 and the Great Recession following the credit crisis. But the chart shows the gap between government and junk bond yields was even narrower at one point in 2014. The gap, or spread, then widened in 2015 and 2016 because of the crash in energy prices and the pressure that put on those companies earnings. “Every energy bond got creamed,” Brilliant said, which made investors fear that other bonds, aside from those with very high credit ratings, would be similarly crushed. “In the meantime, there were opportunities in the materials and energy markets. I was buying bonds yielding eight or nine percent,” Brilliant said. CM Fund Advisors Jim Brilliant, manager of the CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund. Many of those bonds have matured or have been sold by the fund, although Brilliant said he still holding many of them. Despite that happy scenario for Brilliant, the narrow spread could indicate investors are complacent about bond prices, and many analysts are worried that bond prices are heading for a major tumble. Last year, the Federal Reserve raised its target range for the federal funds rate three times to the current range of 1.25% to 1.50%. While that was happening, the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00% actually declined from 2.45% at the beginning of 2017 to 2.40% at the end of the year, as investors didn’t fear inflation. Brilliant expects the Fed to follow up with three quarter-point increases this year, which would bring the target range to 2.00% to 2.25%. But he also expects the Fed to be “mindful not to invert the yield curve,” a relatively rare situation when short-term yields are higher than those for longer maturities. The yield on 10-year Treasury notes has risen since the end of the year and is now hovering around 2.55%. But considering that it declined in 2017 as short-term rates were rising, an inverted yield curve is a real possibility, which according to Brilliant is “generally a precursor to a recession.” The silver lining and good news for value stock investors But Brilliant believes things are different this time around, despite the traditional warning sign, because “now we have synchronized world economic growth,” based on the strengthening of purchasing manger indices. And with the addition of major income-tax rate cuts in the U.S., Brilliant expects “a significant economic recovery is coming worldwide,” Brilliant said,. The long period of historically low interest rates, combined with slow growth, was very good for high-growth companies’ stocks, Brilliant said. But now he sees the increased demand for oil and other commodities feeding greater interest in the long-neglected energy, materials and industrials sectors. This higher level of trust keeps bond prices high and yields low, while also setting the stage for strong performance of value stocks as the companies’ earnings improve. With no sign that the U.S. may be headed into a recession for at least two years, Brilliant believes warnings springing from the narrow spread between high-yield bonds and Treasurys are overblown. The fund CM Advisors manages $1.4 billion, mainly in individual accounts, from its headquarters in Austin, Texas. The CM Advisors Fixed income Fund CMFIX, -0.54%  is a short-term bond fund with $68.3 million in total assets. Brilliant has previously called the fund’s relatively small size an advantage because some of the discounted bonds it buys are only available in relatively small quantities and greatly improve the fund’s overall performance. The fund has a five-star ranking from Morningstar. Here’s how it has performed against its Morningstar category and Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index, through Jan. 16: Total return - one year Average annual return - 3 years Average return - 5 years Average return - 10 years CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund 1.94% 2.42% 1.80% 3.80% Morningstar Short-Term Bond category 1.48% 1.34% 1.11% 2.22% Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 2.52% 1.69% 2.05% 3.83% Source: Morningstar While the fund has greatly outperformed its category, it has underperformed the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index. However, it is less volatile than the index. The fund’s average effective years to maturity three years, while the average maturity for the index is 8.4 years, according to FactSet. The fund’s Sharpe ratio (its average return over the risk-free rate) for five years has been 1.04%, while that of the index has been 0.64%, according to Morningstar. Despite the index’s longer maturity, Brilliant believes comparing it to the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Aggregate Bond Index is fair, because the fund can be managed at longer maturities. Cash and U.S. government obligations made up 47.6% of the fund as of Sept. 30. Among the top 10 holdings of the fund were bonds issued by Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.10%  with a 1.55% coupon due on Aug. 8, 2021; AT&T Inc. T, +0.25% 2.02% due Feb. 14, 2023; Murphy Oil Corp.

AA,"U.S. stock benchmarks finished lower Thursday, pressured by worries over the possibility of a partial government shutdown, as investors sorted through a fresh batch of quarterly earnings results. The Dow, however, managed to retain a foothold above 26,000 while the S&P 500 tied the longest stretch in history without a 5% pullback at 394 sessions. What are the main benchmarks doing? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% fell 97.48 points, or 0.4%, to 26,017.81. The blue-chip average hit an intraday record just after the open at 26,153.42 before retreating and was, at one point, down 168 points to 25,947.32. Boeing Co. BA, +2.46% which has been the biggest contributor to the Dow’s recent rally, led losses, accounting for nearly 70 points of the average’s decline. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  was off 4.53 points, or 0.2%, to 2,798.03, led by declines in energy, real estate, and utilities. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64% shed 2.23 points to 7,296.05. All three major indexes closed at all-time highs on Wednesday, driven by optimism over the economy and corporate results. Leading the pack, the Dow rallied more than 330 points to close at 26,115.65, the first finish ever above 26,000. The S&P 500 rose 0.9% to 2,802.56. The Nasdaq Composite Index rose 1% to 7,298.28. What’s driving markets? Lawmakers are working to carve out a deal to avoid a looming shutdown for Saturday. Democrats and Republicans looked to be making little headway though, with immigration a major sticking point. Republican leaders are scheduled to bring forward a short-term spending bill to keep the government running through mid-February, The Wall Street Journal reported. The move for equity gauges also come as the 10-year benchmark yield TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00%  climbed above 2.6%, a level not seen in months, which could influence appetite for assets perceived as risky like stocks. Higher government-bond yields can raise the appeal of those assets when compared against stocks. Bond prices and yields move inversely. Read: Government shutdowns haven’t always been so bad for Wall Street stocks Which stocks were key movers? Shares of aluminum producer Alcoa Corp. AA, +1.22%  slumped 7% after quarterly results missed Wall Street forecasts. Morgan Stanley MS, +1.98%  rose 0.9% after earnings topped estimates. Wyndham Worldwide Corp. WYN, +1.45%  said it would pay $1.95 billion in cash to buy La Quinta Holdings Inc.’s  LQ, +0.85%  hotel franchise and management business. La Quinta shares were up 3.8%. Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.11%  edged up 0.% as it said it had identified 20 finalists for its second headquarters. What are strategists saying? “I wouldn’t be surprised if markets made a small retreat, or at least took a breather given the threat of a shutdown this weekend. Avoid a shutdown and much of the enthusiasm for equities will be driven by corporate results which have, so far, been supportive of this rally,” said Lee Wild, head of equity strategy at Interactive Investor, in emailed comments. Lee added that the modest moves lower for the Dow are fairly insignificant given the strength of Wednesday’s rally. “Historically, in an environment of slowly rising yields the market has done very well,” said Randy Frederick, vice president for trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial Research, “Yields may be rising because, as the market continues to perform astoundingly, there might be concerns that the [Federal Reserve] is going to raise rates even more than expected, and there’s even some talk that that might be necessary,” he said. The market is expecting between three or four interest-rate hikes of a quarter-percentage point in 2018, according to CME Group data. Economic data First-time weekly jobless claims fell to a 45-year low, dropping by 41,000 to 220,000. Meanwhile, construction on new houses fell 8.2% in December to a 1.19 million annual rate, with economists polled by MarketWatch forecasting housing starts to total 1.28 million. Permits for future construction were basically flat at 1.30 million. Still, permits, housing starts and the number of new homes completed all hit the highest levels since 2007. A gauge of Philadelphia-area manufacturing fell to five-month low of 22.2 in January, the Philadelphia Fed said Thursday. How did other assets do?

AA,"Shares of Alcoa Corp. AA, +1.22% tumbled 6.5% in premarket trade Thursday, after the alumina and aluminum producer missed fourth-quarter profit and revenue expectations, but some analysts raised their price targets, citing rising aluminum prices and the potential for a return of capital to shareholders. The stock closed Wednesday at the highest level since September 2008; the company reported results after the closing bell. J.P. Morgan analyst Michael Gambardella kept his rating at overweight, but boosted his price target to $68 from $55. He said as long as alumina and aluminum prices hold, he believes Alcoa will start looking to return cash to shareholders and further reduce its debt and pension obligations. ""We also think [Alcoa's] stock could benefit from its potentially being added to the S&P 500 in the next few months,"" Gambardella said. Cowen analyst Novid Rassouli lifted his stock price target to $59 from $51, while keeping his rating at market perform.

AA,"The markets are a pretty strange brew right now, with investors not even sure where to look first, with so many different assets swirling around. Is hesitation starting to build over this stock market’s gains? After a two-day run-up for stock futures, Wall Street only let everyone down by the end of Tuesday’s session, the first of the week. That may lead to some sideways glances at some gains early on this morning. “Fool me twice ...” Then there’s the dollar basket-case, bond volatility and finally, the “Great-Scott-what-is-happening-here?” selloff for cryptocurrencies, which may be getting a second wind this morning: Our call of the day suggests investors try not to engage in too much schadenfreude where bitcoin and its ilk are concerned, because there’s a lesson here for stock traders. “Remember the bitcoin optimism and certainty when it rose to $19,000 a couple of weeks ago? The price action at that time felt like it could never go down. Much like today’s certainty regarding equity prices,” writes Kevin Muir, blogging at Macro Tourist. Muir says the S&P 500 has most definitely hit the “just-get-me-in stage” of the rally. When the short-term top finally comes, investors should be ready because it likely won’t “correct by going sideways for a couple of weeks,” he adds, citing one of Wall Street veteran Bob Farrell’s investment rules. And when a correction does come, “it might be more violent than most expect,” Muir says, in separate comments — but note that he’s not making a secular shift or calling for a new bear market. Fear? It’s overblown, says this fund manager. Read: This is a blunt reminder about the randomness of investment performance Weighing in a bit more on that relationship between cryptocurrencies and stocks is Joel Kruger, currency strategist at LMAX Exchange. He says one of the “inherent dangers” with the global central bank response to the financial crisis is that it “necessitated the implementation of an aggressive and unprecedented policy, encouraging excessive and reckless investment. “ And the euphoria driving up cryptocurrencies and meltup of global stocks are both direct products of an ongoing, near-decade long monetary-policy experiment, he suggests in emailed comments. “What’s fascinating, and perhaps ironic, is that crypto has benefited from central bank accommodation, despite being born out of a distrust and rejection of this very institution,” Kruger says.

Boone Pickens doesn’t like cryptocurrencies The chart Larry Tentarelli, of the Trend Trading Signals blog, has had his eye on mining stocks. He said he just took a long position — expecting a gain — in the VanEck Vectors Junior Gold Miners ETF GDXJ, +1.48%  . Here’s the weekly chart he’s watching right now: Trend Trading Signals “It has registered 4 weekly closes over the 40-week (200-day moving average), has been up 4 weeks in a row and is close to a cross of the 10-week and 40-week moving averages, but this has not happened just yet,” he says in emailed comments. Moving averages are used to help gauge where prices are going. “The last time the 10-week crossed over the 40-week moving average was February of 2016, as the ETF tripled in value from $16 to just over $49,” notes Tentarelli. He adds that a weekly close below $32.70 for the ETF would negate that trade.

AA,"Saudi authorities on Saturday carried out a new wave of arrests, targeting royals and cabinet ministers in a crackdown against alleged corruption that comes as the Saudi leadership is seeking to consolidate power during a period of political transition. Billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, a prominent member of Saudi Arabia’s royal family and one of the world’s wealthiest men, was among at least 10 princes and more than two dozen current and former ministers detained by Saudi authorities on Saturday night, according to people familiar with the matter. Al-Waleed is a top investor in Apple Inc. AA, +1.22%   and Twitter Inc. TWTR, +1.97%   He faces charges of money laundering, according to a person familiar with the matter. The targeting of senior princes like Al-Waleed and of sitting cabinet ministers represents an escalation of a campaign of arrests launched by the Saudi leadership in recent months. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—elevated to heir apparent after his predecessor was deposed this summer—is consolidating power before his octogenarian father, King Salman, is expected to abdicate either later this year or early next year, people familiar with the matter said. A-Waleed has long been one of Saudi Arabia’s most prominent business voices, but he hadn’t been seen as a major player in domestic politics. His father, Talal bin Abdulaziz al Saud, however, has previously opposed Prince Mohammed’s rise to power. Representatives of the Saudi government and a spokeswoman for Al-Waleed didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.

AA,"China is attempting to go green, and the country’s environmentally-friendly reforms could mean a way for investors to start seeing green in their holdings. Morgan Stanley’s sustainability team, which focuses on the intersection of investing and environmental movements, found reason for optimism that China, which is notorious for the pollution generated by its massive growth in recent decades, had finally turned a corner towards cleaner living. “Ambitious [electric vehicle] targets, supportive renewable energy regulation and widespread environmental inspections all point to a new degree of commitment by the Chinese government to reform the country’s environmental footprint,” the investment bank wrote in a research report. “Whilst there has been hope of such a strategy before, our analysts’ trips to the region over the past few months give us confidence that this time change is really happening.” How to invest and do good There are four primary areas where this thesis is playing out, Morgan Stanley wrote, naming 80 stocks “that offer exposure to the China Environmental Reform theme.” More than half of those stocks are rated as overweight by its analysts, a bullish rating. The four areas involve the materials sector, power generation companies, the automobile industry, and environmental solution companies, which provide services like water and waste treatment. China has taken aggressive moves to improve its environment and combat global warming. According to KraneShares, which sponsors an exchange-traded fund decided to the China environmental theme, the country is “the world leader in total renewable energy capacity, at 28% of total global capacity.” In addition, the country is looking to spend $360 billion on renewable energy by 2020, and have half of its commercial buildings certified as “green.” “Meeting these standards would create as much new renewable energy capacity as the entire US electricity system, and China would represent half of the world’s green building floor space,” KraneShares wrote. The KraneShares MSCI China Environment Index ETF KGRN, +0.99%  was launched earlier this month and “is comprised of securities that derive at least 50% of their revenues from environmentally beneficial products and services,” according to the fund’s website. The ETF is up 1.8% over the course of the week, compared with the 1.8% drop of the iShares MSCI China ETF MCHI, +1.80%  , which tracks a broad index of Chinese stocks. The Morgan Stanley report doesn’t mention that ETF. Morgan Stanley’s list of 80 stocks that could benefit from China’s reforms include a number of American companies, among them Agilent Technologies Inc. A, +0.75% Alcoa Corp. AA, +1.22% CF Industries Holdings Inc. CF, +3.40%  , DowDuPont Inc. DWDP, +2.08%  , and Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. TMO, +0.26%  , among many others. Tesla Inc. TSLA, +3.24%  was also among the companies, with Morgan Stanley highlighting the potential of electric vehicle sales in the world’s second-largest economy. “The Chinese government is supportive of the development of electric vehicles. As part of efforts to lead in the development of electric vehicles, the Chinese government is targeting 2 million new electric vehicles (NEV) on the road and annual sales of 5 million NEVs by 2020,” Morgan Stanley wrote. It added that its team of auto industry analysts expect electric vehicles would reach 30% of total Chinese automobiles by 2030, compared with 1.4% currently. About 6% of Tesla’s 2016 sales were in China, but Elon Musk’s company could also benefit from its battery technology, Morgan Stanley speculated. “In addition to developing EVs, Tesla has made a serious financial and strategic commitment to developing proprietary EV infrastructure. 10,000 superchargers and 15,000 destination chargers by the end of 2017 is significantly larger than any other [original equipment manufacturer] that we are aware of. Gigafactory economics provide Tesla with a secure source of battery packs at a far larger scale than peers.” Related: Want to fight climate change? Don’t invest in Tesla Morgan Stanley noted that unlike other major economies, China’s move to more sustainable practices and technologies was driven by government regulation, as opposed to the improving economics of alternative energies like wind and solar. Several of the investment bank’s calls reflect “stricter-than-expected enforcement of environmental controls” in various industries, such as cement and aluminum. “Improving environmental standards is a priority for the Chinese government. Environmental inspections have increased, non-compliant producers closed down, and coal power generation discouraged,” Morgan Stanley wrote. These trends are in contrast to movements in the United States, where President Donald Trump has advocated against policies seen as environmentally friendly. In June, Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate accord, a global agreement to reduce greenhouse gases, something scientists say is crucial for avoiding the worst-case scenarios of climate change. Trump has also pledged frequent support for the coal industry, a dirtier form of energy that has seen falling demand for decades amid a shift to alternative energy sources.

AA,"Shares of General Electric Co. have fallen so far this year that they have broken an unwritten rule that the keepers of the Dow Jones Industrial Average use for inclusion in the 121-year old index, in which GE is a founding member. That may not directly lead to GE being booted from the Dow, a move that would end a 110-year long membership. It would mark the third time that GE was not a member of the blue-chip barometer--it was removed and then brought back twice before its latest stretch. But getting kicked out of the Dow DJIA, +1.07%  may be the best thing for investors, as history shows that leaving the Dow has provided a springboard to recovery for other struggling, old-economy companies and their stocks. GE’s stock GE, -1.46%  dropped 1.8% on Wednesday to the lowest close since April 23, 2013, as a rare earnings miss, concerns that liquidity issues will lead to a dividend cut, several recent executive changes and uncertainty over its restructuring plans have unnerved investors and Wall Street analysts. Don’t miss: GE’s stock sinks to 4 1/2-year low after analyst throws in the towel. See also: GE’s profit miss was a shock, and so was the stock’s bounce. The stock closed Wednesday at $21.50, or one-twelfth the price of the highest priced Dow stock, which is currently Boeing Co.’s BA, +2.46%  at $258.42. There are two other Dow stocks, those of Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +1.00%  and 3M Co. MMM, +1.38% that are trading at more than 10 times the price of GE’s stock. On Thursday, GE shares fell 0.3% to $21.43 in midday trade, while Boeing’s stock slipped 0.2% to $257.87. David Blitzer, chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, a unit of S&P Global Inc., told MarketWatch earlier this year that the committee members “prefer” that the ratio of the highest to lowest priced stocks in the Dow be “less than” 10 to 1. GE’s stock broke that ratio guideline on Sept. 8, when it fell to a close of $23.82, while Boeing shares rose to $238.78. FactSet, MarketWatch A spokesperson for S&P Dow Jones Indices said they won’t comment on individual stocks, but added that none of the “rules” are set in stone. The index committee regularly meets to review the composition of its indexes, as well as pending corporate actions, statistics comparing its indexes to the broader market and significant market events, which could include excessive share price movements. “In addition, the committees may revise index policy covering rules for selecting companies, treatment of dividends, share counts or other matters,” the company said in a statement. “S&P Dow Jones Indices considers information about changes to its indices and related matter to be potentially market moving and material. Therefore, all index committee discussions are confidential.” If the committee deemed GE no longer worthy of the Dow, for the first time since it was added back in on Nov. 7, 1907, investors may actually breathe a sigh of relief. In the year before AT&T Inc. T, +0.25%  was replaced by Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78%  on March 19, 2015, AT&T’s stock had gained just 0.7%, while Apple shares had soared 68% and the Dow had surged 11%.

GE has been booted from the Dow before, why not now? GE was a founding member of the Dow, which launched on May 26, 1896 with 12 members, including long-gone “smokestack” companies such as American Cotton Oil, Tennessee Coal & Iron and U.S. Leather, according to data provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices. It was replaced in September 1898, when founding member U.S. Rubber re-entered the index, but then returned just seven months later. GE exited again in April 1901, then came back in on Nov. 7, 1907, as it replaced fellow founding member Tennessee Coal & Iron. It has remained in the index ever since. GE has had a nice run that past century, but a change may be needed. It ended the year as the biggest S&P 500 index component by market capitalization as recently as 2005, when it was valued at $370.3 million, according to data provided by S&P Global. With a current market cap of $189.1 billion, it has less than a quarter of Apple’s market cap of $811.1 billion, and ranks 16th in the Dow by that metric.

AA,"Arconic Inc. named former General Electric Co. executive Chip Blankenship as its new leader, roughly six months after its prior chief executive stepped down after sending an unauthorized letter to an activist investor. Mr. Blankenship, the former CEO of GE Appliances, will take over as Arconic's CEO on Jan. 15., the company said Monday. Arconic is currently being run by interim CEO David Hess, who has filled the position since April. He will stay on as a director at the company. Mr. Blankenship steps into his new role following a tumultuous period for Arconic as it has faced struggles from activist investor Elliott Management Corp. and its connection to a fatal June fire at Grenfell Tower in London. Arconic's former CEO, Klaus Kleinfeld, left the company in April after sending a letter to the hedge fund perceived as ""a threat to intimidate or extort"" the firm. Arconic didn't get behind the letter Mr. Kleinfeld sent and said it was bad judgment, The Wall Street Journal previously reported. Both Mr. Kleinfeld and Arconic decided he should leave the company. After the incident, Arconic granted Elliott three more board seats in May. Mr. Blankenship's hire was called ""an excellent selection"" by David Miller, Elliott's senior portfolio manager, in a statement issued Monday. ""Chip is a talented and hands-on operator who knows Arconic's core businesses exceedingly well,"" Mr. Miller said. ""We have confidence that Chip will deliver the results and returns that Arconic is capable of producing, and we look forward to working constructively with him."" In addition to Mr. Blankenship being named CEO, Arconic also said John Plant will become chairman of the company's board, taking over for Pat Russo. Mr. Plant's appointment takes place immediately. Arconic continues to face multiple lawsuits and a U.K. inquiry in connection with the Grenfell Tower fire, which killed at least 80 people. A key focus of the U.K. inquiry will be on the building's exterior cladding, which was made of a flammable plastic filling and is suspected of contributing to the quick spread of the fire. Arconic has said it wasn't involved in the design or installation of the cladding system used at the tower. The company reported $7 million in legal and advisory costs in its latest quarter in connection with the Grenfell Tower fire. Arconic, which was split from aluminum maker Alcoa about a year ago, also on Monday reported a third-quarter profit of $119 million, down roughly 28% from a year ago. Revenue rose 3% to $3.2 billion. The company also increased its revenue guidance for the year to $12.6 billion to $12.8 billion, compared with its prior forecast of $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion. Shares in Arconic rose 1.4% in premarket trading to $27.54.

AA,"The S&P 500 and the Dow overcame selling pressure in a rebound near the closing bell, eking out records on Thursday as Wall Street marked the 30th anniversary of the 1987 crash. Political tensions in Europe and lackluster economic reports out of China were blamed for keeping stocks in negative territory for most of the session even as robust earnings kept the market from retreating too far. What are stock indexes doing? The Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA which was down more than 100 points at one point during the day, rose 5.49 points to close at 23,163.04 while the S&P 500 index US:SPX  edged up 0.84 point to 2,562.10. Consumer staples and technology stocks were hardest hit but were balanced by big gains in health-care and utilities sectors. The Nasdaq Composite US:COMP bucked the broader trend to fall 19.15 points, or 0.3%, to 6,605.07. See: Dow 23,000 marks fresh history for blue chips And check out: Dow’s historic close above 23,000 belies a flicker of weakness What’s driving markets? Thursday marked the anniversary of the 1987 stock-market crash, and some investors have voiced concerns about how sharp stocks have run up since the November 2016 election, ignoring U.S. political and valuation concerns, among others. Read: Wall Street pros recall ‘sheer panic’ of October 1987 stock market crash Meanwhile, Catalonia’s president, Carles Puigdemont, failed to meet a demand to give up the region’s push for independence. The Madrid government responded by suggesting it will trigger the process for imposing central control when it holds a special cabinet meeting on Saturday. A suspension of autonomy in Catalonia could potentially spur fresh protests and instability for one of the eurozone’s biggest members. Global stock markets came under pressure following reports that growth in China slowed in the third quarter. Stocks in Hong Kong HK:HSI  dropped 1.9%, led by losses for property, banking and tech shares. Many believe stocks will continue to rise on hopes that President Donald Trump’s administration will get a tax deal done. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned in a recent interview with Politico that stocks could take a big hit if tax cuts aren’t implemented soon. What are strategists saying? “While there is no question that markets are overvalued and we could see some corrections, the path of least resistance for stocks is still to go higher. I will start reducing risk when credit spreads begin to widen and when we see sustained signs of rising inflation,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank. Which stocks are in focus? Apple Inc.’s US:AAPL  stock dropped 2.4%, putting it on track to suffer the biggest decline in a month. Also weighing on Apple was a report in The Wall Street Journal that the new Apple Watch’s independent cellular connection feature was abruptly cut off in China, without explanation. Philip Morris International Inc. US:PM  shares slid 3.9% after adjusted earnings and sales fell short of expectations. Verizon Communications Inc.’s US:VZ  shares rose 1.2% after reporting third-quarter results that mostly beat analysts’ estimates and affirmed its 2017 outlook. eBay Inc. US:EBAY  shares fell 1.8% after the online marketplace cut its annual profit outlook for the second straight quarter. Shares of database-software company MongoDB Inc. US:MDB  soared 34% in their debut, after its initial public offering priced at $24 a share late Wednesday. See also: MongoDB IPO: 5 things to know about database-software company Alcoa Inc.

American Express Co. US:AXP  shares fell 0.2%. The company topped Wall Street expectations on earnings and raised its guidance, and said Stephen Squeri, the current vice chairman, will become chief executive and chairman on Feb. 1. What are data saying about the economy?: First-time jobless claims fell to 222,000 in the week ended Oct. 14, marking the lowest level for claims from those seeking employment benefits since March 1973, highlighting continued strength in the labor market. Economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast claims to come in at 244,000. Meanwhile, the Philadelphia Fed manufacturing index, or the Philly Fed index, surged four points to 27.9, representing a 5-month high. Any reading over zero signals improving conditions. Economists had forecast a reading of 20.2. The index of leading U.S. economic indicators fell 0.2% in September, marking the first drop in 12 months, partly due to the effect of recent devastating storms. How did other assets fare?

AA,"The stock market may never go down again. Maybe not such a far-fetched notion, when you consider the Dow industrials yesterday nailed its 50th record close of the year and paid a visit to the 23,000 milestone, which it looks set to revisit and maybe stick to today. To mark the occasion, Pension Partner’s Charlie Bilello, the originator of that opening comment, went on a bit of a tweetstorm. He noted how reaching that 23K milestone in other times would be a classic contrary indicator, but will probably juice this bull market another 1,000 points — which itself is less and less of a big deal: To be sure, being in the trenches of this market since the election has been a bit crazy-making, even if it has made investors some money. And naturally, there is discomfort out there over the speed of gains, such as how the DJIA has overcome a pile of worries to gain 4,700-plus points in just under a year. Given that, taking a step back and a look around is never a bad idea. That brings us to our call of the day from Kyle Bass of Hayman Capital Management, who has a timely warning on an “air pocket” that’s coming as we near the 30th anniversary of Black Monday. “If you look at the all of the different constituencies of the market today, it resembles the portfolio insurance debacle of 1987 on steroids,” he says an interview with Real Vision TV released to YouTube today, but recorded a few weeks ago. What will it take to set off a stock market correction? When a 4% or 5% decline in equities quicky morphs into a 10 or 15% decline. “That’s what you have to look for,” Hayman’s chief investment officer says. “If you see the equity market crack 4 or 5 points, buckle up, because I think we’re going to see a pretty interesting air-pocket, and I don’t think investors are ready for that,” Bass warns. What’s exacerbating the situation is the massively popular shift from active to passive investing over the years. That means risk is “in the hands of people who don’t know how to take risk,” the hedge fund manager says. Other big names in finance gave Real Vision interviews for its piece on the potential for a major market correction — the problem with valuations right now, the parallels to 1987 — and of course, what investors should do now. For one, the Felder Report’s Jesse Felder says buying the stock market is “essentially taking on an incredible amount of risk ... for the prospect of zero reward over the next 10 years.” The message overall was clearly to cut back on a bit of risk, look at cash, and peel back a bit on where there have been some good runs.

AA,"Alcoa Inc. shares AA, +1.22% rose 1.8% premarket Friday, after the company said it has reached agreement on the early termination of a power contract tied to the Rockdale smelter in Texas.

AA,"The second-quarter earnings season is drawing to a close, and we at MarketWatch are not sorry to see it go. Once again, companies added to the stress of wading through the flood of releases in a variety of ways, old and new. We counted many examples of releases that were difficult to access, that lacked key numbers, that had financial tables that were flipped or that were confusing. These are all issues we have seen and raised as red flags for investors in the past. Companies managed to find new and creative ways to irk us, as we detail below. We reiterate our argument that, in doing so, they are breaking their fundamental agreement with their shareholder-owners to keep them fully informed of the true state of their businesses. And we’re not alone in our concern. “We continue to see U.S. corporations offering less transparency in their quarterly reports, instead issuing very general and vague statements that make it difficult for investors to truly decipher how the company performed,” said Christine Short, senior vice president of media at Estimize, a platform that crowdsources earnings estimates from a variety of parties, including buy-side and sell-side analysts, executives, academics and others. On top of the usual accounting manipulation that takes place on the bottom line, “companies have a tendency to hit readers with the good news upfront in their releases, even if it has very little correlation with stock price, and bury the bad news deep within financial tables at the bottom of the report,” said Short. In case you missed it: Here’s how investors are duped each earnings season This earnings season, we were surprised to find some big companies failing to mention key metrics high up in their press releases. ConocoPhillips US:COP is a serial offender in this respect, failing to offer any revenue number in its release, forcing us to search for regulatory filings. That’s after it was told by the SEC that it wasn’t allowed to publish a non-GAAP revenue number that was based on both historical and future performance. Read now: ConocoPhillips drops use of revenue figure first flagged by MarketWatch This time around, Starbucks Corp. US:SBUX surprised us by hiding its net-income number, the most basic measure of profit, in a table, with the release highlighting operating income instead. ‘We continue to see U.S. corporations offering less transparency in their quarterly reports, instead issuing very general and vague statements that make it difficult for investors to truly decipher how the company performed.’ Christine Short, Estimize The number of companies that flipped the presentation of current- and prior-period numbers in tables increased this quarter. It is a basic financial-reporting principle that tables are read from left to right, so flipping them means some readers could easily mistake the year-earlier numbers for current ones and calculate comparisons incorrectly. The companies that flipped their tables included longtime offenders Ford Motor Co. US:F , Google parent Alphabet Inc. US:GOOGL US:GOOG and SodaStream International Ltd. US:SODA , but they were joined by aluminum giant Arconic Inc. US:ARNC , which has adopted the same practice as its former parent, Alcoa Inc. US:AA  . Others included Select Medical Holdings Corp. US:SEM , Kronos Worldwide Inc. US:KRO , Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals Inc. US:CYCC , Endocyte Inc. US:ECYT , Verso Corp. US:VRS , Financial Engines Inc. US:FNGN , Valhi Inc. US:VHI , Birner Dental Management Services Inc. US:BDMS , Tesaro Inc. US:TSRO  , Biocept Inc. US:BIOC , Egalet Corp. US:EGLT , Salem Media Group Inc. US:SALM and Williams Cos. US:WMB , which actually has tables running in both directions. Flipping the table is not a breach of SEC rules, but it is clearly something that catches reporters and analysts out, as MarketWatch has reported. And for analysts trying to compare companies or feed reams of data into a spreadsheet, it’s clearly a challenge. “Since most companies show the most recent period first, many people scanning the report quickly may wrongly assume that the first column is indeed the most recent period,” said Ariel Markelevich, chief product development officer at financial data provider Calcbench. “Altering that is likely to confuse the users.” Easy access Companies like Netflix Inc. US:NFLX , Square Inc. US:SQ and Zynga Inc. US:ZNGA still release earnings in a shareholder letter that is impossible to pull up quickly. MarketWatch has written before about the delay caused when companies make investors, and the reporters who serve them, search for earnings on a website, which almost invariably crashes under the strain of so many people attempting to access it at the same time. Documentary Clip: 'Icarus' Netflix shares, for example, have often moved sharply by the time most news services start reporting its numbers, suggesting a clear advantage for institutional investors with machine-readable trading services that scrape websites for relevant information at high speed. Retail investors have no chance against the machines. Netflix offended us more than usual this earnings season with its post-earnings-report video “interview,” which it uses instead of a conventional earnings call in which analysts can ask for more detail on the numbers. In the past, Netflix hosted a videotaped interview with Chief Executive Reed Hastings, Chief Financial Officer David Wells and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos with one or two analysts or a combination of analysts and a journalist. This time, just one analyst featured in a prerecorded session that was barely audible, as MarketWatch’s Therese Poletti reported. The low-quality production would certainly not pass muster on the streaming platform if it were part of its own original content. Then there was Activision Blizzard Inc. US:ATVI , the videogame maker, which we discovered is playing a whole other game with its numbers. The company was told by the SEC in 2016 to drop revenue deferrals from its non-GAAP numbers, or earnings-report figures that do not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. Deferrals represent cash that has been received but not yet earned. The company then started emailing journalists and asking them to make a calculation so that they would provide the regulator-prohibited adjusted revenue number to investors. The company said it provides supplemental information to facilitate comparison to analyst consensus figures. But analysts can and do adjust how they prepare forecasts if companies make changes to their accounting. Read more about the Activision saga: This company found a unique way to skirt SEC accounting rules Taking a longer view Tesla’s earnings call was remarkable for the flippant way that Chief Executive Elon Musk dismissed concerns about inaccurate statements he had made regarding demand for the Model 3, the electric car maker’s new sedan, which is aimed at the mass market. Musk told journalists at the launch event for the new car that Tesla had 500,000 reservations for the Model 3, an important figure that investors, journalists and analysts had been clamoring for an update on ever since Tesla US:TSLA announced 373,000 reservations more than a year before. Then, on his call, Musk admitted that statement was inaccurate, explaining that while it had received 518,000 reservations for the car, the number had shrunk to 455,000 due to cancellations. “I don’t think it really has much materiality,” Musk said of the number. Also: Elon Musk gets the $35,000 price tag he wanted for Model 3, but autonomy and more range cost extra Can Tesla Live Up to Its Hype? Materiality is not for Musk to decide, however. It is up to the Securities and Exchange Commission to determine whether he made an inaccurate material statement, and the SEC had already made Tesla a target. Read: Tesla is a large public company, and Elon Musk must start acting like it The SEC may also want to consider whether a company should be allowed to provide investors with an upbeat view of its results and outlook in a public press release, then provide a downbeat outlook on an earnings call. Hush Puppies owner Wolverine Worldwide Inc. US:WWW , for example, reported second-quarter profit and revenue figures that beat expectations, and highlighted in the headline of the press release that it was raising full-year guidance. But on the analyst call, Chief Financial Officer Michael Stornant said third-quarter adjusted earnings per share were expected to be in the range of 34 to 37 cents, which was well below the FactSet consensus of 53 cents. Stock gains immediately evaporated. Read: Wolverine’s stock swings lower after downbeat outlook to analysts offsets upbeat earnings release Separately, the reported adjusted per-share earnings of 43 cents excluded $3 million in store-closure inventory markdowns, but included $8.4 million in associated second-quarter revenue, which seems to go against Question 100.03 of the SEC’s updated “Non-GAAP Financial Measures Compliance & Disclosure Interpretations.” Chief Financial Officer Michael Stornant explained that normal operating losses from the stores were included, and only the “really abnormal markdown rates” associated with accelerated store closures were excluded. When asked for comment, Stornant questioned why MarketWatch was writing a story, when the information in the press release and conference call was publicly available. We explained that not all of MarketWatch readers have equal access to the information. Then there are the companies that are headquartered overseas but have U.S. stock listings, some of which prefer to report their numbers in the local currency, instead of dollars. If those companies don’t at least provide the U.S.-dollar equivalent of their numbers, investors can’t compare the results to those of U.S.-based competitors in like terms. Germany-based Trivago N.V. US:TRVG , for example, provided percentage changes from year-ago results, but amounts were reported in euros, without referencing an exchange rate. Since the euro appreciated 3% against the U.S. dollar from the end of the second quarter to the date on which second-quarter results were reported, Aug. 4, investors with access to exchange-rate data could value reported revenue of €298.3 million at anywhere between $340.9 million to $351.2 million. Apple Earnings: Services Revenue Tops Starbucks and McDonald's Finally, each earnings season we also select a company that deserves praise for a well-written, clear, logical release that has all of the key numbers right up top in an easy-to-follow format. This season, that honor goes to Tyson Foods Inc. US:TSN , which presented us with a release that was a delight. From the headline, which included an upbeat outlook, to the table at the top laying out the key numbers in the right order, with the year-earlier comparisons, the Tyson release is an example of how it should be done. We contacted Tyson to congratulate it on an excellent job. It responded: “Our team puts a great deal of thought into sharing our results in a clear, insightful way, while also complying with GAAP and SEC standards,” said spokesman Gary Mickelson. ‘We’re pleased our efforts are having their intended effect, and appreciate the acknowledgment of those who work behind the scenes.” Corporate America, take note.

AA,"Arconic Inc. said Monday its second-quarter earnings rose as the aerospace- and automotive-parts maker worked to cut costs. The company raised its full-year performance outlook, lifting the range of expected sales to $12.3 billion to $12.7 billion from previous guidance of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion. Arconic also boosted the lower end of its adjusted per-share earnings forecast by 5 cents to a range of $1.15 to $1.20. Arconic has been under pressure to cut costs since splitting off from aluminum maker Alcoa Inc. in November of last year. The company's adjusted earnings margin before taxes rose to 14.9% from 14.7%. Sales in its rolled products segment fell 4% as the company wound down its Tennessee packing business. Excluding this impact, sales jumped 8%, outpacing the 1% growth in the much-scrutinized engineered products business, which saw falling profit and contracting margins. During the quarter, Arconic stopped selling Reynobond PE, a construction product that was installed on the Grenfell Tower in London, which caught fire June 14 and resulted in the death of at least 79 people, for use in high-rise construction. The company maintains that it was compliant with its sale of the product and didn't disclose whether the decision impacted sales. In all, Arconic topped views, reporting earnings of $212 million, or 43 cents per share, compared with $135 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, earnings fell to 32 cents per share from 33 cents. Revenue edged up 0.8% to $3.26 billion. Analysts were expecting earnings of 26 cents on $3.18 billion in revenue. Shares rose 4.4% to $25.31 during premarket trading, adding to a 36% rise so far this year.

AA,"Klaus Kleinfeld received $2.3 million in shares on his first day as an executive of Alcoa nearly a decade ago, and profited from generous grants of new stock and options—and opportune sales—ever since. He was incentivized with $1.5 million in performance pay for each $1 in the company’s stock price in January 2016, more than double the $700,000 rate in January 2009. And the CEO was awarded about $120.8 million in total compensation during that time, unusual for an executive at a company whose market value declined by as much as $15 billion . Last fall, the 59-year-old Ph.D. in strategic management spun off Alcoa’s AA, +1.22%  long-suffering commodity business, and took the helm of its successor company, Arconic ARNC, +1.50%  , which specializes in lightweight aluminum and alloyed products for cars, trucks, and airplanes. But in the midst of a proxy fight with the activist hedge fund Elliott Management, Kleinfeld lost his job. The board removed him for writing a rambling note on personal stationery to the hedge fund’s founder, Paul Singer, who interpreted the letter—and a used soccer ball that came with it, both delivered by company messenger—as a threat. Also read: Arconic’s CEO ouster won’t satisfy Paul Singer’s Elliott Management This week, Arconic shareholders were to vote on competing visions for the future. Under a compromise agreement reached just ahead of a rescheduled annual meeting on Thursday, the company—under recently appointed Chairman Patricia Russo—supported the election of three board candidates nominated by hedge fund Elliott Management, which paid $1.6 billion for a 13.2% stake in the company. Even so, it’s worth looking at how the Russo board supervised Kleinfeld at the helm of one of the worst-performing companies in the S&P 500, and how he profited in ways that investors typically could not. TimeArconic Inc.20102012201420162018 US:ARNC $25 $50 $75 The board issued Kleinfeld higher-valued equity awards in five out of seven years from 2010 to 2016 even as the company’s stock price declined by 19%. Between January 2011 and January 2013, the board increased the number of stock options it granted him by 91%, and raised the number of his restricted shares by 58%, despite a 45% decline in the stock price during that period. •Kleinfeld’s stock and options were often granted at the low end of the monthly trading range, including the lowest closing price in January 2016 and January 2008; and third lowest in January 2009 and January 2013. In only one year out nine was the grant in the upper half of the monthly range. A low basis price maximizes profit opportunities. For instance, Kleinfeld was awarded 2.1 million restricted shares and options valued at $9.9 million on Jan. 16, 2016, when the closing price of Alcoa’s stock was $7.03 lower (31% cheaper) than its monthly high on Jan. 4. •The difference of a week—or even a day—between when Kleinfeld annually sold his shares and was granted new ones usually accrued in the CEO’s favor. These sales, which sometimes are arranged to settle tax obligations or the cost of the underlying securities, if any, are usually managed by the company itself. For instance, on Jan. 18, 2011, Kleinfeld unloaded 40,350 shares at $16.27 a share a week before being awarded 851,060 new options and restricted shares three cents cheaper than those he’d just sold. On Jan. 23, 2012, he sold 765,278 units at $10.25 a share one trading day after being granted nearly 1.1 million in options and restricted shares at eight cents cheaper than those he’d just sold. In January 2013, Kleinfeld sold shares at a price two cents more than those he was granted that same month. And in January 2014, he sold shares for 60 cents more than he those he was granted that month. His lucky streak ended in January 2015, when he sold some shares at the grant price, and some for less. While the price and quantity of the stock that Kleinfeld sold varied from year to year, the pennies saved added up. Selling on Day One Kleinfeld was the CEO of German engineering giant Siemens AG SIE, +1.55%  when named to Alcoa’s board in a non-executive capacity in November 2003. Not quite four years later, Siemens orchestrated his departure after the company became embroiled in a foreign bribery scandal. Kleinfeld swiftly accepted a new job as Alcoa’s president and chief operating officer. In addition to a $1.3 million relocation package to pay for his move from Munich, and a $6.5 million signing bonus, Kleinfeld was awarded special grants of immediately vested and restricted shares. Kleinfeld wasn’t the only beneficiary of corporate largesse. Earlier that year, the board made its annual grant of shares to company stewards a day before authorizing a 13% increase in the dividend, and the repurchase of 10% of all shares outstanding. That produced an immediate bump in the stock price. It’s yet another example of how company insiders benefited from even small gains in a stock inexorably headed lower. As the global financial markets crisis took hold, and aluminum prices cratered, Kleinfeld stepped into the CEO job at Alcoa in early 2008. For the next nine years, he offered irrepressible optimism to investors—words such as “transformation” and “sustainable value”—as company earnings and the share price delivered disappointments. Getty Images Patricia Russo Meanwhile, former Alcatel CEO Patricia Russo was appointed to the board in November 2008, and immediately joined the compensation committee. She was added to the powerful executive committee in 2011—serving alongside Kleinfeld—as well as the governance and nominating committee. And she took over as chair of the compensation committee just as it was replacing its existing pay consultant with a new firm, Pay Governance. At the hands of Russo and Pay Governance, Kleinfeld’s compensation ballooned from $10.4 million in 2008 to $14 million in 2011, and $18.2 million in 2014. In late 2014 and 2015, Alcoa delivered higher quarterly earnings, and the strongest full-year operating results since 2008. That sent the stock temporarily soaring. And Kleinfeld began unloading shares—$12.9 million worth in July 2014; $11.5 million in October 2014; and $16.7 million in January 2015—totaling $41.1 million in seven months. In November 2015, Elliott Management disclosed owning a 6.4% stake in the company. And in January 2016, Kleinfeld sold still more shares a day before he met with representatives of the hedge fund at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. It was two days before Moody’s Investors Service placed the ratings of 11 U.S. mining companies, including Alcoa, on review for a downgrade. At this point, the activist investor began to put the screws to board and management during a series of private meetings. Talks spilled over into the public this January when Elliott Management nominated its own board slate in a campaign it headlined, “New Leadership is Needed at Arconic.” Company shares had now rebounded, nearly doubling over the past year. Whether that is the result of a management-inspired separation of Arconic from Alcoa, or the fox running ahead of the hounds, is hotly debated. On April 11, Kleinfeld had a letter hand-delivered to Elliott Management’s founder, Singer, along with a game ball from a 2006 FIFA World Cup match in Germany. You can find these keepsakes on sale at eBay for about $600. Kleinfeld intimated he’d become aware of some “colorful” exploits that had become “lastingly legendary” during a trip Singer made to Berlin that year, when Kleinfeld was based in Munich. He offered the soccer trophy to “bring back some ‘vivid’” memories, and signed the letter with oversized initials—like large birds of prey flying across the page—familiar to anyone who has read his shareholder letters. Also read: Arconic adds two directors ahead of board vote The next day, Elliott Management general counsel Richard Zabel, a former chief of the criminal division at the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan office, wrote the Arconic board that Kleinfeld appeared “to be making veiled suggestions that he might intimidate or extort Mr. Singer.” The board itself characterized the letter as demonstrating “poor judgment,” and Kleinfeld resigned “by mutual agreement.” He had a company pension valued at about $19 million, severance payments worth up to $20.5 million—depending on the terms of departure—and potentially millions of dollars more in stock options, and unvested or unearned shares, as well as the possibility of future health benefits and pension accruals. Looked at this way, the hedge fund has helped to make Kleinfeld a very wealthy man. Arconic asked Elliott Management to consider dropping its “highly disruptive and distracting proxy fight.” With the three board seats and a say in naming a new permanent CEO, the hedge fund relented on May 22. Elliott Management manages $33 billion, and has many irons in the fire. Paul Singer’s interests don’t necessarily correspond with those of other Arconic shareholders. But the resolution of the proxy fight puts to bed a long, and contentious, argument over whether Kleinfeld’s departure was—as Elliott Management argued—”overdue,” and “a necessary first step on the path to a new, stronger Arconic for shareholders and employees.” More from MarketWatch How Russian Trolls Collected Americans' Personal Information More Coverage Home sellers now use spycams to gather intel on prospective buyers Stephen Hawking’s final Reddit post is going viral over its ominous warning about robots What America’s gun fanatics won’t tell you","May 26, 2017 1:52 p.m. ET",2,How to make millions on a losing stock?

AA,"Arconic Inc.’s ouster of Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld means activist investor Elliott Management Corp.’s bullying tactics have paid off, as the stock surged toward its biggest gain in two months. But rather than satisfy Elliott, it made billionaire investor Paul Singer’s hedge fund even more ornery. Elliott, which is Arconic’s ARNC, +1.50%  largest shareholder, has been pushing hard for months to get the aerospace and automotive-parts maker’s CEO booted. Elliott blamed him for the company’s spending and history of missing financial forecasts before it was split from aluminum giant Alcoa Corp. AA, +1.22%  Read more about Elliott’s fight to push Kleinfeld out. On Monday, Elliott got its way. Arconic said Kleinfeld was leaving the company after using “poor judgment” by contacting Elliott directly without board approval. “[Kleinfeld] stepped down as [chairman] and CEO by mutual agreement after the board learned that, without consultation with or authorization by the board, he had sent a letter directly to a senior officer of Elliott Management that the Board determined showed poor judgment,” Arconic said in a statement. The stock ran up as much as 8.6% in intraday trade, before paring gains to close up 79 cents, or 3.1%. That was enough to be the S&P 500 index’s SPX, +1.38%  fourth-biggest gainer, and was the biggest one-day percentage gain since mid February, after Elliott launched its campaign to get Kleinfeld booted, and nominated five directors. FactSet With Elliott’s primary objective now realized, Arconic effectively said it hoped the activist hedge fund would stop pressuring the company. “It is Elliott Management’s decision whether to continue to burden Arconic and its shareholders with hits highly disruptive and distracting proxy fight, or to support Arconic in facilitating an effective CEO search and transition,” Arconic said in a statement. Elliott responded by saying Kleinfeld’s letter was much worse than just “poor judgment,” and was a reflection of even bigger issued it had with the company’s board. “To be clear, the letter read as a threat to intimidate or extort a senior officer of Elliott Management based on completely false insinuations, a threat that we took seriously and about which we immediately and privately informed the board,” Elliott said in a statement. “When such conduct manifests itself in a pattern as it has here, it s not a CEO problem. It is a board problem.” Elliott disclosed last month that it owned 51.1 million shares of Arconic. Including options to buy an additional 7.3 million shares, Elliott said it has “exposure” of 13.2% of Arconic’s common shares outstanding. Arconic CEO Kleinfeld on Alcoa Split: 'Two Strong Companies' The means the stock’s rally could be boosting the value of Elliott’s bet in Arconic by about $46.1 million. First Pacific Advisors LLC, which is Arconic’s fourth-largest shareholder with about 20.5 million shares, or 4.7% of the shares outstanding, has also been pushing for a management shake up for years. The firm could be making $16.2 million on its Arconic bet on Monday. Arconic had tried to fend off Elliott, by disclosing in a filing last week that Elliott’s proposals could constitute a “change in control,” which would require the company to pay the $500 million it owes to a trust that holds deferred compensation and retirement benefits. Elliott responded by saying Arconic’s change-in-control claim was false, and was “an act of desperation” to entrench itself. Graphic embed is no longer available. Arconic insisted that Kleinfeld’s ouster had nothing to do with the proxy fight or Elliott’s criticisms of the company’s strategy, and isn’t related to the company’s financial performance. The company also defended Kleinfeld’s performance. Elliott scoffed at Arconic’s explanation: “This statement--essentially a full-throated ‘in memoriam’ defense of Dr. Kleinfeld’s strategy and leadership--amounts to a damning indictment of the board’s judgment and demonstrates that, remarkably, the board appears to have learned nothing from this contest.” Arconic said board member David Hess would be interim CEO until a permanent CEO is found, and appointed Lead Director Patricia Russo as interim chairperson. Kleinfeld has been on Alcoa Inc.’s board of directors since 2003, and became Alcoa’s CEO in 2008, a role he retained after the company separated into Arconic Inc. and Alcoa Corp. Arconic’s stock has run up 48% since the company separated from Alcoa Inc., while Alcoa Corp.’s shares have soared 58% and the S&P 500 has rallied 9.8%.

AA,"A week into its fight to shake up Arconic Inc.’s boardroom, Elliott Management Corp. says the aerospace and automotive parts maker has a little less room to improve than it previously estimated. The activist investor last week launched a fight for five board seats and to replace Chairman and Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld, suggesting Arconic’s stock could rise by as much as 138% if the company ramped up its cost-cutting efforts. In an updated investor presentation, the hedge fund revised that estimate down to 105% based on a lower cost-cutting estimate. Arconic, which separated from aluminum giant Alcoa AA, +1.22%   last year, quickly seized on the change. In a press release Tuesday, it said the revision raises questions if Elliott “truly understood Arconic and its opportunities.” Arconic ARNC, +1.50%   has said Elliott doesn’t grasp the finer points of the parts-manufacturing business and has defended Kleinfeld’s record.

AA,"You’ve probably read recent headlines telling you to stay away from bonds because interest rates are rising. But such conventional wisdom might not make sense if you are looking for income and have the patience to stick with a long-term strategy. The CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund CMFIX, -0.54%  is a short-term bond fund managed not only for current income and capital preservation, but also to take advantage of opportunities in the market to scoop up discounted securities. That can add significantly to long-term total returns through economic cycles. The mutual fund has a five-star performance rating, the highest, from Morningstar. We spoke with James Brilliant, the fund’s manger, about its strategy. But, first, here’s some background: The inverse relationship between interest rates and bond prices The “problem” when interest rates rise is that the market values of bonds fall, so that their yields will match those of newly issued bonds with similar maturities and credit ratings. If you buy your own bonds for income and hold them to maturity, this is not an issue. You will continue to receive your income and will be paid the face value when they mature. You might have purchased your bonds at a premium or a discount, but you know before buying how much of a gain or loss you will have on the investment when the bonds mature. “Unfortunately, there are a lot of investors who don’t understand the risks inherent in their decisions to chase yield.” James Brilliant, portfolio manager for the CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund But what if you want income and wish to preserve capital, and don’t want to manage your own bond portfolios? At this time, what may be appropriate for part of your portfolio is a short-term bond fund. The yield will not be spectacular, but volatility will be relatively low, and as bonds held by the fund mature, its yield will rise as the money is invested in newer, higher-yielding paper. Fund strategy and performance The CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund has a 30-day yield of 1.90%. The fund’s objective is to provide income, preserve capital and boost total returns by taking advantage of special opportunities. In an interview on Feb. 6, Brilliant said his team screens for bonds “that have been sold off relative to their underlying fundamentals.” “We can look back a year ago and see credit spreads for corporate bonds [over U.S. Treasury securities with similar maturities] widened, especially in the materials, energy and industrial sectors,” he said. When the interest-rate spreads for those sectors widened, the fund bought investment-grade bonds at discounted prices, and enjoy gains in market value when the spreads “subsequently narrowed,” he added. James Brilliant, manager of the CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund Brilliant went on to say that following recessions, as the U.S. economy recovers, there are typically three cycles of widening and narrowing spreads for corporate bonds, which present opportunities to supplement income with capital gains. At this point, corporate-yield spreads have compressed to the point “where they look expensive.” However, “at the same time, we have a higher average coupon rate relative to the duration,” Brilliant said. The fund can purchase high-quality bonds anywhere in the world, but the fund is mainly invested in the U.S. As of Dec. 31, 44% of the fund was invested in U.S. Treasury securities, with 8% in cash and the rest in investment-grade bonds. Among the top 10 holdings of the fund were bonds issued by Cloud Peak Energy CLD, -9.35%  with a coupon [interest rate based on the face value of the bond] of 8.5% due Dec. 15, 2019; Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Corp. GLDD, +5.75%   7.375% due Feb., 1, 2019; and Alcoa Inc. AA, +1.22%  5.87% due Feb. 23, 2022. The fund has $65.6 million in total assets, while CM Advisors manages $1.2 billion, mainly in individual accounts, from hits headquarters in Austin, Texas. Brilliant said the fund’s relatively small size enables it to take advantage of discounted sectors in ways that “wouldn’t move the needle” for giant bond funds. Here’s how the fund has performed over long periods. The following figures include cash dividends and price changes, through the end of 2016: Total return - 2016 Total return - 3 years Total return - 5 years Total return - 10 years Total return since fund inception - March 24, 2006 CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund 6.93% 7.15% 9.87% 57.21% 70.35% Bloomberg Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 2.65% 9.37% 11.67% 53.00% 59.51% Source: CM Advisors So the fund underperformed the index for three and five years, but it more than doubled the index in 2016 and outperformed over the two longest periods. Here’s a different set of average performance figures from Morningstar, through Feb. 3: Total return - 1 year Avg. return - 3 years Avg. return - 5 years Avg. return - 10 years CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund 8.37% 2.18% 1.90% 4.89% Bloomberg Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Bond Index 1.16% 2.41% 2.15% 4.34% Source: Morningstar So we see a similar pattern, with recent outperformance and the fund beating the index for average 10-year return. When asked whether investors might be better served by looking for significantly higher yields with dividend stocks or preferred stocks, Brilliant said: “Unfortunately, there are a lot of investors who don’t understand the risks inherent in their decisions to chase yield.” During 2016, investors did just that, bidding up prices for utilities and other dividend stocks to high levels relative to earnings. Some investors won’t be able to bear the inevitable price volatility, setting up major losses.

AA,"Elliott Management Corp. launched a campaign Tuesday to shake up the board of Arconic Inc. and oust Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld, three months after he separated the aerospace and automotive-parts maker from aluminum giant Alcoa. The activist hedge fund's announcement that it would nominate five directors to Arconic's board and seek to oust Mr. Kleinfeld as CEO came just an hour after the company reported its first quarterly results as a stand-alone company and just before Mr. Kleinfeld was scheduled to discuss the results with investors and analysts. Elliott, Arconic's largest shareholder with a 10.5% stake, cited cost overruns, the company's stock performance and a ""broken company culture"" in a presentation to investors. The Wall Street Journal reported Monday that several of Arconic's biggest investors have urged the company to remove Mr. Kleinfeld. The company said Mr. Kleinfeld has the unanimous support of its board, which includes three directors Elliott backed last year in an earlier settlement. Mr. Kleinfeld is the board's chairman. Arconic said its current slate of directors are executives or former executives with ""a broad range of knowledge, experience and skills at the highest levels of both public and private companies."" It said the board had reviewed Elliott's allegations and found that many are ""misleading or not substantiated."" ""Klaus and the management team are 100% focused on continuing to improve operating results, expand margins, improve return on net assets and deliver sustained shareholder value,"" said Pat Russo, Arconic's lead director. In an interview Tuesday before the hedge fund's announcement, Mr. Kleinfeld attributed the dissatisfaction of some investors to their unfamiliarity with the aerospace, automotive and defense markets Arconic serves. He said the company's shareholder base is still largely made up of commodity-focused investors, but that is changing. ""We are always open to engage with our shareholders,"" he said. Arconic's board has 13 members, and five seats will be up for election at the annual meeting this spring. Elliott is nominating directors for all five spots but said it wouldn't run a candidate against Ulrich Schmidt, one of the directors it backed last year, if he runs for re-election. The hedge fund also is proposing Larry Lawson, the former chief executive of Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc., to replace Mr. Kleinfeld as CEO. Mr. Lawson ""has the ideal set of skills needed to turn around Arconic's woefully and continually underperforming business,"" Elliott said in its presentation. The fight likely will hinge on whether investors believe Mr. Kleinfeld can boost the company's margins and profitability. Arconic has said Mr. Kleinfeld has cut $4.4 billion in costs since he joined and more than doubled the company's combined margin on earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to 15%. It is targeting 17% for 2019. In its presentation, Elliott said Alcoa significantly underperformed peers under Mr. Kleinfeld. The stock lost 68% during his tenure until the split. Mr. Kleinfeld took the helm at Arconic in 2008, just before the financial crisis sent its shares down sharply. Arconic says the split he engineered has created a combined 22% return for investors who held the stock before the breakup. The fight came immediately after Arconic posted results slightly weaker than expected on Tuesday in its first quarterly report as a stand-alone company. The company's loss deepened during the period because of expenses linked to the 2016 breakup. Alcoa Inc. was renamed Arconic Inc. when it spun off its raw aluminum business, now know as Alcoa Corp., in November. For the latest quarter, the company posted a loss of $1.25 billion, or $2.88 a share, compared with a loss of $701 million, or $1.64 a share, a year ago. Excluding certain items, adjusted earnings were 12 cents a share, up from 3 cents, but a penny shy of analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Revenue edged up 0.8% to $2.96 billion, just shy of the $3 billion analysts expected. For 2017, the company expects revenue of $11.8 billion to $12.4 billion and adjusted earning of $1.10 to $1.20 a share. Analysts expect the company to earn $1.04 a share from $12.1 billion of revenue. Last year, the company scaled back guidance twice. Mr. Kleinfeld said the company's 2017 forecasts have been ""pressure tested"" to account for soft markets. He acknowledged during a conference call Tuesday with analysts that the company's 2016 performance was disappointing, especially in the Firth Rixson aerospace components business that Arconic purchased in 2014 for $2.9 billion. ""We could have executed better and we recognize it,"" he said. ""We own it."" Arconic's closely watched engineered products division for the fourth quarter reported adjusted pretax income of $265 million, up 9% from a year earlier, as sales for the business were flat at $1.4 billion. Engineered products is the company's largest business and focus of Arconic's push to expand its presence in markets for higher-value components in the aerospace and automotive industries. Mr. Kleinfeld predicted that demand for Arconic's products, particularly from the aerospace industry, are likely to remain sluggish in 2017, as aircraft builders complete destocking of airframe parts and jet-engine production ramps up at a slow rate. ""We expect that some of the challenges will continue,"" Mr. Kleinfeld said. ""We don't expect 2017 to be a big-growth year, but we do expect to continue to make good progress on expanding margins."" --Ezequiel Minaya contributed to this article.

AA,"Several of Arconic Inc.’s biggest shareholders are pressing the company to oust of Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld, less than three months after he separated the parts maker from aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. The shareholders are unhappy with the company’s performance and blame Mr. Kleinfeld, who served as Alcoa’s AA, +1.22%  CEO for eight years before taking the helm at Arconic ARNC, +1.50% according to people familiar with the matter. The company’s spending and history of missed forecasts dating back to before the split are among their complaints, the people said. Some of the investors have brought their concerns about Mr. Kleinfeld to Arconic’s board, of which he is chairman, the people added. In a statement, Arconic said Mr. Kleinfeld “substantially transformed” Alcoa during his tenure and more than doubled margins in the Arconic business. “His strategy to separate Alcoa Inc. has been highly successful, and has already unlocked significant value for all shareholders,” said Arconic, which is scheduled to report its first quarterly results post-split Tuesday.

AA,"The Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday both crossed and closed above the 20,000 level for the first time, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite also cruised to records after upbeat earnings releases from heavyweights such as Boeing Co. and optimism over the economy. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  surged 155.80 points, or 0.8%, to close at 20,068.51, with Boeing Co. BA, +2.46%  and Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +1.53%  contributing heavily to gains. “Clarity is the markets’ oxygen. The more President Trump provides, the more Dow 20,000 moves to the rear view mirror — Dow 21,000 will soon become the next media obsession,” said Quincy Krosby, market strategist at Prudential Financial, in emailed comments. The new president has said he wants to cut corporate taxes and loosen regulations in moves that could potentially help corporate earnings. Since the Dow first crossed 19,000 on Nov. 22, the biggest contributors to the blue-chip average’s quick 1,000-point rise were Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, +1.00%  (154.6 points), International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.60%  (90.6 points), Boeing (75.5 points), Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.93%  (69.8 points), and UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06%  and Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78%   tied at 56 points a piece, according to Dow Jones data. Don’t expect, or hope for, 21,000 too soon however, said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist at LPL Financial, in an interview. That would raise red flags of a top about to blow off. Plus, the February after an election has traditionally been the weakest month for the S&P 500 since 1950, he said. The S&P 500 index SPX, +1.38%  gained 18.30 points, or 0.8%, to close at a record 2,298.37, with eight of the main 11 sectors trading higher. Financial and industrials shares were leading gains, while telecoms and real estate lagged behind. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64% finished up 55.38 points, or 1%, at 5,656.34. The tech-heavy index has outperformed other indexes so far this year, gaining 5.1% year to date. “What’s happening with earnings is driving gains, not just in the U.S., this is a global rally,” Detrick said. Plus, resumed leadership from financial stocks and small-caps point to more positives than negatives, he added. The small-cap Russell 2000 index RUT, +1.08%  rallied 1%, while the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF, +1.36%  jumped 1.7%. Another cautionary signal would also be another big surge in the dollar, he said. “The actual drive upward, and I don’t mean the unimportant level of 20,000 on the Dow, is being driven by a combination of better-than-expected earnings and especially outlooks from companies that suggest that economies in the U.S. as well as in Europe and Asia are in a better shape than we previously thought,” said Kim Forrest, senior analyst and portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group.

AA,"Alcoa Corp. expects the global glut of aluminum to ease this year as rising demand in China cuts into surpluses. In its first quarterly report since splitting from parent company Arconic Inc. last year, Alcoa reported a fourth-quarter loss stemming from costs to close mines and a refinery in South America. Sales slightly exceeded expectations amid rising prices for aluminum and the feedstock alumina. Alcoa's fourth-quarter shipments of aluminum rose 4% from the same time last year and 12% from the third-quarter. ""We had a good start,"" Chief Executive Roy Harvey said during a conference call Tuesday with analysts. ""We're enthusiastic about what we can accomplish."" Faced with a flood of aluminum from China and weak prices, Alcoa split last year. Its mining and smelting divisions became a separate company that kept the Alcoa name, freeing Arconic to focus on making goods for the aerospace and automotive industries. Alcoa's prospects looked dimmer to many, but its shares have risen 58% since the November split on expectations that large-scale infrastructure projects promised by President Donald Trump will drive up aluminum demand. Arconic's shares have risen 12.7%. New York-based Alcoa said rising input and energy expenses are tempering excess, unprofitable production in China. China's exports of raw aluminum ingots and aluminum products fell 4% in 2016, according to Bradford Research Inc. Alcoa predicts the global demand for raw aluminum in 2017 will grow 4%, including a 6% increase anticipated in China. The aluminum surplus is projected to be between 400,000 and 800,000 metric tons. At the same time, global supplies of bauxite and alumina are tightening, though Alcoa predicted those markets should remain balanced in 2017. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Alcoa reported a loss of $125 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with a loss of $826 million, or $4.52 last year. The company attributed its loss for the period to $151 million in one-time costs connected to the closure of a refinery and mines in Suriname. Excluding the special items, Alcoa earned 14 cents a share, compared with a loss of 58 cents the year before. Revenue rose 3.5% to $2.54 billion, from a year ago.

AA,"Aluminum maker Alcoa Corp. posted a loss and said its adjusted profit fell short of Wall Street expectations, even as increased alumina prices pushed sales higher. Shipments of aluminum products were also up, climbing to 852,000 metric tons from 819,000 metric tons. Looking ahead to this year, the company predicts global aluminum demand growth of 4% over 2016.

But while we’re waiting for President Donald Trump to get stock investors excited, or really scared, it’s worth keeping an eye on other assets, which have triggered volatility for equities in the past. That brings us to oil — one asset that should never go ignored by investors too long. Our call of the day comes from Raoul Pal, founder of Global Macro Investor. He says it’s time to buck the big-money trend and short oil, because those who produce the black stuff think the price right now really should be at $30. Here’s a series of tweets he pushed out Monday: Pal’s call comes after the latest weekly Commitment of Traders report from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (ending Jan. 17) showed hedge funds and other money managers placed more bullish oil positions than any week since 2006. That’s as actual producers upped their short hedges to the highest level since 2007, in a bid to lock in higher prices. (Check out chart of the day in Monday’s Need to Know) No one can deny the magnificent rally — roughly 65% — that crude has seen over the past 12 months. But cheers over the post-OPEC output-cut deal are dying down as U.S. shale producers seem ready to pick up the slack. Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch are warning that oil prices in local currencies are nearing 2014 levels, and that could cut into emerging-market demand growth. Protectionist policies from Trump and the U.K. could also hold back global trade, and hence curb oil demand, those analysts say. Then there’s the expectation by some that Trump will introduce measures to support the U.S. oil and gas industry, and wean the country off foreign suppliers. Rising U.S. supply, of course, will lean on prices in the coming month, Commerzbank told clients, adding: “In view of the record-high optimism exhibited by speculative financial investors, we see a risk of falling prices.” Key market gauges The S&P SPX, +1.38% , Dow DJIA, +1.07%  and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.64%  are off to the races after a timid start, with the major indexes aiming for fresh records.

AA,"Investors hoping for insight on the outlook for 2017 during the fourth-quarter earnings season that kicked off Friday may be frustrated by the uncertainty surrounding the policies of a new administration. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged a number of measures viewed as potentially positive for the economy, including slashing regulations, reforming corporate taxes and launching a stimulus package focused on repairing and upgrading infrastructure. But then there’s Trump’s promise to bring jobs back for American workers by upending trade agreements and his aggressive use — even before his inauguration — of Twitter to shame big manufacturers like car makers into bringing jobs back from overseas centers like Mexico. See: Here’s why Trump’s inauguration could mark a near-term top for stocks “He wants a very aggressive pro-growth agenda,” said Steve Reitmeister, executive vice president of Zacks Investment Research. “Sounds great on the surface, except that if he pushes too hard on the gas pedal it will cause inflation. That is especially true with a nation near full employment that is already starting to show signs of wage price inflation.” The December jobs report showed wage growth at a seven-year high, its fastest pace since the Great Recession. The economy added 156,000 new jobs in the month. Graphic embed is no longer available. Lowering taxes and embarking on growth initiatives are strategies that are more typically used during the early stages of economic expansion, not eight years into one, said Reitmeister. Lindsey Bell, investment strategist at CFRA, agreed that expectations are for Trump policies to lead to an improvement in 2017 earnings, but advised caution. Trump’s actual policies are still unclear, and combined with the effects of a rising dollar and oil prices, will challenge management teams as they start to plan for the year ahead. Trump’s first press conference since July, held Wednesday, covered Russian relations, health care and the conflicts of interest with his now family-run Trump Organization, but didn’t extend to economic policy. Bell believes investors are pricing in a broad earnings beat for the fourth quarter, but she doubts results will “rock the market.” Don’t miss: What President-elect Trump means for every U.S. industry. “We expect guidance will unlikely move higher in the near term and could even be reduced from the current estimate, as is standard practice, disappointing investors and potentially causing a pullback or pause in the market,” she said. S&P 500 companies  SPX, +1.38%  are expected to report average earnings growth of 3.2% for the quarter, according to FactSet, after growth of 3.20% in the third quarter. Sales are expected to grow 4.2%, after growth of 2.77% in the third quarter. That was after four straight quarters of declining earnings and five straight quarter of declining sales. Energy and materials, which had weighed heavily on earnings in the last few years, are expected to lead the charge this quarter, as oil and other commodity prices have come back from their 2015 lows. See also: Energy companies are about ready to loosen the purse strings This earnings season marks a break with a long-held tradition: Aluminum giant Alcoa AA, +1.22%  was not the first company to post earnings, following its split into two companies. Instead, three big banks, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.82% Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.04%  and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.81% led the way Friday. J.P. Morgan posted better-than-expected earnings thanks to buoyant trading revenue. The bank’s business tied to helping its clients buy and sell stocks, bonds and other securities, saw a 24% rise in revenue to $4.5 billion from $3.6 billion a year ago, with fixed-income specifically enjoying a more than 30% pop in revenue compared with the same period a year earlier. Those results helped the U.S.’s biggest bank by assets ring up a record annual profit of $24.73 billion, beating the previous record of $24.44 billion set in 2015. See: ‘Bearish divergence’ warns it isn’t safe to buy bank stocks Bank of America profit rose 43%, but revenue fell slightly short. Wells Fargo profit fell as mortgage revenue dipped and its recent sales-tactics scandal weighed. Don’t miss: End of a stock-market era: Alcoa breaks tradition of being first to report earnings See also: J.P. Morgan earnings: Expect a strong trading quarter and improved credit markets Here are five things to watch for this earnings season: The Trump factor Expect company conference calls to include plenty of mentions of the incoming Trump administration, which is expected to have a major impact on corporate behavior. His promise to lower the U.S. corporate tax rate, which at 35% is one of the highest in the world, and his pledge to give companies a tax holiday to encourage them to repatriate cash held overseas are expected to give some companies a bit of a windfall, if executed. That’s widely expected to boost share buybacks, which had begun to shrink in 2016 after years of spending. Goldman Sachs expects S&P 500 companies to spend about $780 billion on buybacks in 2017, up 30% from 2016. The bank is expecting 48% of an expected $2.6 trillion in corporate spending to go to shareholder rewards, either in the form of dividends or buybacks. Companies are likely to wait and see what tax moves are made before finalizing repatriation or buyback plans, so major announcements are unlikely this quarter. Still, General Motors Co. GM, +2.45%  said Tuesday it was adding $5 billion to its buyback program, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CMG, +1.13%  said it would add $100 million to its $2.1 billion authorization and car parts-maker Visteon Corp. VC, +2.18%  approved a $400 million program. The big bad buck The strong dollar will once again be an easy target for companies that look to redirect blame should sales and earnings growth disappoint. Dollar strength relative to the currencies of countries in which a company does business lowers the value of profits and sales derived from those countries. A rising dollar also increases the prices of U.S. exports, reducing their appeal to overseas customers, and lowers the cost of imports, making them more attractive to U.S. consumers. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.15% which tracks the dollar against the currencies of six major trade partners, soared 7.1% during the fourth quarter, to take it 3.6% above where it was at the end of the same period a year ago. That was the biggest quarterly percentage gain in the buck since the first quarter of 2015. FactSet As J.P. Morgan equity strategists wrote in a recent note to clients, historically, a 6% rise in the trade-weighted dollar could cut S&P 500 earnings per share by 2% to 3%. So watch out for companies reporting EPS or sales growth rates using phrases such as “currency neutral,” or “constant currency” or “local currency,” which could overstate bottom-line results. There is good reason to expect the dollar to continue its upward trajectory if Trump keeps his policy promises. Fiscal stimulus by way of a big boost to infrastructure spending is expected to lead to further interest rate increases by the Federal Reserve, which in turn makes the dollar more attractive to foreign investors. And a potential byproduct of cash repatriation is dollar strength, because companies need to convert that cash to dollars before they can use it at home. The more money that is repatriated, the more dollars companies have to buy. Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA, said the information technology sector could be one of the hardest hit by the dollar’s rise, given its “substantial exposure to foreign sales.” The technology sector generated 58% of its revenue from international sources in 2015, according to data provided by S&P Dow Jones Indices, compared with the 44% exposure for the S&P 500. “The profits on non-U.S. revenues also tend to be relatively high, given generally lower tax obligations abroad,” Stovall said. A higher-than-usual EPS bar The biggest trick to beating expectations, is to lower those expectations enough to make them easier to beat. Quarterly earnings-per-share estimates for the S&P 500 have declined an average of 4.3% during that quarter over the past five years, and by an average of 5.6% over the past 10 years, according to data provided by FactSet. Don’t miss: Earnings beats are concealing bad results. Also read: Priceline investors are being fooled again. But the fourth quarter was different. The EPS estimate for the index declined just 2.2% from Sept. 30 through Dec. 31, according to FactSet. In addition, only 69% of S&P 500 companies that issued an EPS outlook during the quarter gave negative guidance, which is below the five-year average of 74%. The fact that the bar of expectations hasn’t been lowered as much as usual could make it harder to hurdle. With that in mind, the technology sector could be the most likely of the S&P 500’s 11 key sectors to get tripped up, as it was the only sector that has recorded an increase in expected earnings growth since the start of the quarter, of 1.3%. That contrasts with the average 3.8% drop over the past five years, FactSet said. The SPDR Technology Select Sector exchange-traded XLK, +1.98%  rose 1.2% during the fourth quarter, closing at a 16-year high on Dec. 27. Here's what Trump means for the tech industry Meanwhile, the sector that had its bar lowered the most was materials, which is expected to post year-over-year EPS growth of 4.3% as of Dec. 31, down from the 19.4% growth expected on Sept. 30. Rising rates a boon for banks but a concern for other sectors Another topic of company commentary will likely be the sharp rise in interest rates during the quarter, and expectations that they will continue to increase. While the financial sector may speak glowingly about the rising-rate environment, other sectors could use it as an excuse to provide conservative earnings guidance. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.00%  soared 83.8 basis points (0.838 percentage points) during the fourth quarter, the biggest quarterly jump since the first quarter of 1994. The rate rally came one quarter after the yield hit a record low. The Federal Reserve raised its target for overnight interest rates during the just-completed quarter for only the second time since the Great Recession, and increased the number of expected rate hikes in 2017. FactSet Rising interest rates can provide a boost to bank profits and revenue, in the form of higher net interest income, as they increase what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, or loans, through shorter-term borrowings. The SPDR Financial Select Sector ETF XLF, +1.36%  soared 20% during the quarter, compared with a 3.3% gain in the S&P 500. Don’t miss: Financial stocks surge as Trump victory soothes regulatory fears, lifts rates. But other sectors may not be so upbeat about the interest-rate outlook, as J.P. Morgan strategist Dubravko Lakos-Bujas said rising rates can act as “a gradual headwind to margins.” Lakos-Bujas said a 100-basis-point rise in the 10-year Treasury note yield should increase annual interest expenses for the S&P 500 by $15 billion in 2017, and by $19 billion in 2018, assuming all maturing debt is refinanced. Minding the GAAP Investors can expect this season’s earnings to be easier to follow, as the Securities and Exchange Commission has ramped up its efforts to ensure they fully comply with rules on the use of GAAP—or Generally Accepted Accounting Principles—and non-GAAP, adjusted numbers that companies argue can supplement officials ones and provide greater clarity for investors. The SEC issued new guidelines last May that oblige companies to give equal or greater prominence to GAAP numbers over non-GAAP one and explain how the two are reconciled. The regulator continued to send comment letters to companies that are failing to measure up during the fourth quarter, including some that MarketWatch had specifically highlighted in a series focusing on the issue.

AA,"The U.S. fourth-quarter earnings season will kick off this Friday, and its launch will mark the end of an era. The first earnings will come from three banking giants, J.P. Morgan & Co. JPM, +1.82% , Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.04% and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.81% . That marks a break with a long tradition. Aluminum giant Alcoa Inc. has unofficially started the earnings season for years but will no longer do so, now that it has split into two companies to separate its raw aluminum operations from its aerospace and automotive supply businesses. Don’t miss: Alcoa to release last earnings before it splits up The split was completed on Nov. 1, with a new Alcoa Corp. AA, +1.22% housing the traditional metals business.

FCA, +0.32% . Graphic embed is no longer available. Alcoa had long struggled with low prices in an aluminum glut created by China, while the businesses now housed in Arconic were expected to enjoy stronger growth. The split was the idea of Arconic Chief Executive Klaus Kleinfeld, who had led Alcoa since 2008 and viewed the move as a way to create “two leading-edge companies, each with distinct and compelling opportunities,” as he said in the September 2015 statement announcing the split. Arconic CEO Kleinfeld on Alcoa Split: 'Two Strong Companies' Alcoa, which has its roots in 19th-century Pittsburgh, was long a stock-market darling.

AA,"The euphoria that took the U.S. stock market to all-time highs in December on great expectations for more fiscal spending and tax reforms following Donald Trump’s surprise presidential election victory is fizzling out and could make for soggy price action over the next few weeks, according to analysts. “Taxable investors who wanted to sell their stockholdings have been waiting to do so in January to take advantage of possibly lower taxes. That kind of selling will result in pullbacks.

As highlighted by MarketWatch’s Victor Reklaitis on Friday, Arbeter observed that the sectors that did the best over the past few months are the ones most likely to see the most pain in the near term: small-cap stocks, financials and industrials. Meanwhile, areas that are likely to do the best in the near term, according to Arbeter are consumer staples and utilities. “Once this mean reversion ends, it’s very possible that financials and industrials will take us higher,” Arbeter wrote.

In the absence of corporate news in the coming week, investors will focus on macro indicators, according to Jaffee. Among the most important data releases will be the employment report on Friday, which is expected to show the U.S. economy created 170,000 jobs in December. Manufacturing data and factory orders are also scheduled for next week. “Jobless claims hit an all-time low a few months ago, so while the latest number can be called ‘benign’, the trend is indicating a little softness in the labor market. We expect investors focus on the payrolls number with markets reacting strongly to any disappointment,” Jaffee said.

AA,"Did Donald Trump defang the FANGs? The most popular Internet stocks have been duds since the presidential election. While the broader stock market has risen 3% or so since then, the so-called FANGs — or Facebook, Amazon.com, Netflix and Alphabet — are down as much as 7%. What’s going on? “There is a view that they are going to be disadvantaged under a Trump administration,” says Larry Puglia, who manages the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund TRBCX, +1.79% “But I don’t really see it that way.” Puglia thinks investor fears are exaggerated, and that the FANGs will continue to be the kind of “durable growth” companies he likes to own. If he’s right, that means the FANGs are buyable in the current weakness. I’ll walk though his logic below. But first, I’ll point out that Puglia is well worth listening to. For one thing, he is one of the biggest fund managers on the planet. He has $55 billion under management, including the $32.6 billion in his T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund. (The rest: managed accounts.) He’s got years of experience in the business. And his fund beats competing funds by 2.6 percentage points a year annualized over the past five years, according to Morningstar. It also beats competitors over the past 10 years. Puglia certainly has big FANG bets in place. Amazon.com AMZN, +1.11%  is his biggest position. It occupies a huge 9% of his Blue Chip Growth portfolio. He’s got a 4.9% position in Facebook FB, +4.42% and a 4.3% position in Alphabet GOOG, +2.71% Those are his top three positions. He also has a large position in Netflix NFLX, +3.35% (As well as Priceline US:PCLN and Alibaba BABA, +2.59% other FANG-like stocks that have sold down for similar reasons.) Puglia is not alone in thinking that investors have it wrong on the FANGs. Baird analyst Colin Sebastian thinks the sector weakness already discounts any elevated risks under a Donald Trump administration. “We believe that positive secular growth trends will generally override negative forces,” says Sebastian. His favorites in the current bout of weakness are Alphabet and Facebook. To be sure, these stocks clearly aren’t the buys they were a few years ago when they were truly despised. I first suggested them in my stock letter, Brush Up on Stocks, years ago as contrarian plays when they were really disliked — Amazon.com at $192 in March 2012, recently at $760; Facebook at $25 in April 2013, now $117; Google at about $300 in May 2012, now $776; and Netflix at a split-adjusted $29 in May 2012, now at $115. Those stocks are now up 295%, 368%, 158% and 296%, respectively, compared with about 40% to 70% for the broader market. If you missed out on those moves or you don’t own FANGs at all, the current weakness offers an opportunity to get a little exposure. (I reiterated Netflix at $91 in July in my stock letter, and I continue to suggest buying it near or below that price.) If you own them and you’re concerned about the current weakness, relax. They should be OK. To understand more about why current FANG fears are exaggerated, I recently sat down with Puglia in New York City to talk about the risks. Let’s work through the fears about these names one by one. FANG fear No. 1: There will be an antitrust crackdown “People are very, very fearful that Donald Trump will take an antagonistic view toward these companies on an antitrust basis,” says Puglia. To see why, look no further than Amazon.com CEO Jeff Bezos, who owns a big newspaper that Trump does not like. “The genesis of this is that Jeff Bezos owns the Washington Post, and I think Donald Trump was not pleased with the press coverage he was receiving from the Washington Post. And he made a comment that Amazon, in his view, might have an antitrust issue,” says Puglia. Investors also know that Trump has been a vocal critic of the proposed merger between AT&T T, +0.25%  and Time Warner TWX, +0.40% points out Sebastian, the Baird analyst. But could there really be an antitrust crackdown on the FANGs? “I don’t believe that, frankly,” says Puglia. “All of them have a large and growing market share. But based on the way we look at the antitrust laws, none of them are in violation, or close to being in violation.” FANG fear No. 2: An immigration crackdown will hurt them All of the anti-immigration rhetoric has investors worried that the FANGs will have even bigger challenges finding talented coders and other kinds of engineers, who are in short supply domestically. They like to hire those employees from abroad, because they are hard to find in the U.S. “Tech companies have been very heavily dependent on the H-1B visa program, which allows them to hire foreign nationals, particularly engineers but really a wide variety of people,” says Puglia. “But I don’t think Trump is opposed to legal immigration. And he is certainly not opposed to bringing in very talented people who will create economic value. There will not be significant impediments to legal immigration. We will still have the H-1B visa program.” FANG fear No. 3: Net neutrality will go away Current law prohibits companies that own the Internet backbone, like AT&T, Verizon VZ, -0.37% and Comcast CMCSA, +2.67%  from charging for preferred access, or “high-speed lanes.” This is called net neutrality. A Federal Communications Commission controlled by Democrats has favored net neutrality. Now, investors fear that could change, with the Republican sweep of Washington, D.C. “While a rollback of net neutrality was not a core campaign issue, Mr. Trump publicly opposed net neutrality,” says Baird’s Sebastian. So it’s possible the new administration will support changes that allow telecom and cable companies to charge content suppliers extra for Internet fast lanes. As video delivery continues to become more important for Facebook, Amazon, Google’s YouTube and, obviously, Netflix, this change could cut into profits at those companies. “I would be surprised if things changed substantially,” says Puglia. “I would argue that there are a lot of forces in Congress and proponents who believe we should have some form of net neutrality.” As for Netflix, which stands to suffer the most, Puglia points out that the company already pays extra for special carriage agreements with several of the major internet backbone companies. Netfix would still suffer from a rollback in net neutrality, “but it wouldn’t necessarily be a death knell for their business,” he says. FANG fear No. 4: New import taxes and trade barriers would hurt internet retailers Companies like Amazon.com depend on the free flow of lots of cheap imported goods to sell to consumers. So trade wars, trade barriers and import duties would drive up the cost and prices of those goods, eating into profits or reducing demand. But while Trump campaigned hard on the theme of “brining manufacturing jobs back home” by using tariffs and other trade barriers to block imports from China and Mexico, it remains to be seen whether Republicans will have the stomach to support those moves. Trade barriers can reduce global economic growth. But closer to home, Americans love to shop. The political backlash against import taxes and trade restrictions that increase the price of stuff that people love to buy could be big. FANG fear No. 5: FANGs face retribution for supporting Hillary Clinton With the notable exception of PayPal PYPL, +1.08% cofounder Peter Thiel, a lot of Silicon Valley types lean to the left. Is it now payback time? “Trump recognizes that many of the leaders of internet companies were public with the fact that they supported Hillary Clinton in the election,” says Puglia. But that doesn’t necessarily mean Trump and Silicon Valley will get into a cat fight. “I can’t imagine Trump is going to take an antagonistic view to these companies. I mean, they are a vibrant part of the economy. I don’t think he is going to be antagonistic to Facebook, Google or Amazon.” FANG fear No. 6: FANGs will be weighed down as a source of funds to purchase cyclical names Cyclical companies like Alcoa AA, +1.22% Caterpillar CAT, +1.53% CSX CSX, +2.58% Honeywell International HON, +0.87% 3M MMM, +1.38% FedEx FDX, +2.26% and United Technologies UTX, +1.10% caught fire after Trump’s victory. Investors think these economically sensitive companies will benefit from additional economic growth spurred by Trump policies like big infrastructure spending and corporate tax cuts. “In the aftermath of the election, investors said ‘Wow, we are going to have infrastructure spending, lower corporate tax rates, less regulation, and all of these things help very cyclical industries,’ ” says Puglia. So they sold their FANG winners to fund purchases of cyclical names. Puglia doesn’t think that’s necessarily such a smart move, in part because it’s not yet really clear how much Trump can accomplish. “We don’t want to trade what we view to be superior business models and companies with superior growth prospects for something that might be a cyclical trade just based on policy changes,” says Puglia. “To us, it doesn’t seem wise to sell these durable growers, particularly when they are very reasonably valued.” Facebook now trades at less than 17 times what Puglia thinks the company can earn in 2018, yet revenue is growing at greater than 50%. It sells for a price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of just 0.83. According to this Peter Lynch yardstick, high growth companies like Facebook are a good value if their PEG ratios are below 1.5. Google recently dipped below 18 times earnings. Its PEG ratio is 1.2. These valuations suggest that sooner or later, investors will wise up and come back to the FANGs. The homecoming of big cash Besides, not all Trump policies would be bad for those companies. Trump favors tax-law changes to encourage repatriation of cash held overseas, and this would help the FANGs. They could use repatriated cash to fund share repurchases, dividends, mergers and acquisitions, and other investments. “Overall, we view a repatriation tax holiday as a positive for the group,” says Sebastian, the Baird analyst. “Particularly for companies currently in stages of elevated investment, like Amazon, Facebook and Google.” At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. Brush has suggested FB, AMZN, NFLX, GOOGL, HON, FDX and UTX in his stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks. Brush is a Manhattan-based financial writer who has covered business for the New York Times and The Economist group, and he attended Columbia Business School in the Knight-Bagehot program.

AA,"Arconic Inc. on Monday announced its first major supply deal, a $1 billion contract to supply Airbus Group SE with aluminum sheet and plate. The company is a corporate heir to Alcoa, which still exists, but as a spun-off unit focused on producing raw aluminum. Arconic's business strategy is aimed at getting out of mining and smelting, and instead supplying the aerospace and automotive industries -- as Alcoa did over $10 billion in supply deals this decade -- and it has touted its ability to generate complicated alloyed parts like lightning-resistant fasteners. This deal with Airbus, however, is to make the airplane's skeleton -- meaty structural parts that keep it intact in the air and on landing. Much of the aluminum being sold will go toward making Airbus' A320, and will come from a new machine called a ""very thick plate stretcher"" the company owns at a factory in Davenport, Iowa. The plate stretcher is the kind of technology Arconic says will allow it to expand overall profit margins in ways it couldn't do when it was Alcoa and hamstrung by the ups and downs of the raw aluminum market. The machine, which literally stretches the metal, will come online in 2017 and make ""high-strength monolithic wing ribs."" Arconic also says a key selling point is its special multimetal alloys with ""combination of strength, corrosion resistance, density savings and manufacturability."" Klaus Kleinfeld, formerly Alcoa's CEO who has now taken the helm of Arconic, said that the contract is ""a further important step to expand our leadership position in the aerospace industry"" and that ""partnerships like this with industry leaders are core to our strategy."" Although the aerospace industry remains vulnerable to business cycles, Arconic is expected to sign more supply deals. Airbus and Boeing Co. have a combined $1.6 trillion order book of over 12,500 jets, and many models are sold out for years. Write to John W.

AA,"PALM BEACH, Florida, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- PALM BEACH, Florida, March 8, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MarketNewsUpdates.com News Commentary Graphite is a mineral that is quietly fuelling the future of clean technology, and its applications in the battery market just keep growing and growing. Graphite grabbed investors' attention when Tesla CEO Elon Musk, determined to provide the world with clean battery power for cars and homes, identified Graphite and Nickel as key elements in the lithium-ion battery cell mass. Musk even said that lithium ion batteries ""should be called Nickel-Graphite."" Minerals like these are vital to the growth of clean tech. Mining companies like SunPower Corp. SPWR, +4.18% Global X Lithium LIT, +1.35% First Solar FSLR, +2.39% Alcoa Corp. AA, +1.22% and Graphite Energy Corp. (cse:GRE) GRXXF, +6.45% know this, and are strategically mining the minerals of the future. Tesla's electric vehicle (EV) batteries have captured plenty of headlines, but the automotive sector is not necessarily going to be the largest consumer of lithium ion batteries. The big use will come in the home batteries sector, and solar panel roofs, powered with Tesla battery packs, require even more graphite. Battery powered homes will be the way of the future, and are projected to increase demand for graphite over 1,000 times. The North American hotbed of graphite production is actually in Québec, Canada, where junior mining companies Mason Graphite Inc. and Graphite Energy Corp. are rapidly assembling operations. Technology that transforms the future of grid power   Of all the strategic minerals in play, graphite offers the greatest opportunities for growth in the evolution of solar power technology. Solar roofing and battery storage systems are transforming the future of grid power, and graphite technologies are making materials stronger. Graphite Energy Corp. will be pivotal in providing the natural grade mineral needed to support the supply chain demand. Graphite will be needed to store the power generated from Tesla's new solar roofs, which are already on the market. Tesla has even started selling solar panels at Home Depot. The company is reportedly going to start selling the panels at nearly 800 retail locations, bringing the technology to consumers via the bricks and mortar market. Graphene - the World ' s most Conductive Material   Graphene, a form of carbon that results from the reduction of graphite, is the world's most conductive material, and it offers a range of opportunities for advanced display technologies, communications systems and desalination solutions. Graphene is also going to be an essential component in the solar panel market, as home builders adopt solar power technology. Graphene is also produced at Graphite Energy Corp.'s Lac Aux Bouleaux (LAB) property in Québec, which is located right next to Imerys, the only actively producing mine in North America. Technical data obtained during discovery confirmed that LAB is a natural flake graphite mine, and natural graphite is what clean technology companies like Tesla need to gear the globe towards a green future. Powerwall: the breakthrough home battery technology   With Tesla's breakthrough home battery powerwall technology, power batteries will soon be installed in every new home. The powerwall actually detects grid outages and automatically becomes a home's main energy source - protecting a home from a power outage. This technology will keep lights on and phones charged during a grid power failure. The power is stored in large batteries in a unit usually located outside of the home or in an electrical room. These home batteries are considerably larger than car batteries and they will require large amounts of graphite, making the mineral a very hot commodity. As the industry evolves, solar panel power will be stored in the batteries, which would require up to five times as much graphite in the home battery storage than in a car battery. Solar companies already know most new home builders are able to install solar panels. While hydro companies are the grid power source, graphite is a key element that brings solar power back to the grid. Eventually, this powerful technological capability, fueled in large part by graphite, will scale to hydro companies across North America and in Europe. Graphite Energy Corp. recognized this imminent increase in global demand, and is set to bring the mineral to market first. Canada - the Graphite production capital of North America     While graphite was identified as a mineral critical to the US economy, there are no actively producing graphite mines in the United States. Investors in the US could be turning their eyes North, as Mining.com reported that almost a quarter of all new capacity in the world could be in Canada. There are currently over 30 credible flake graphite projects being investigated in Canada. Graphite Energy Corp. (cse:GRE) GRXXF, +6.45% has the lead on other mining juniors because the company has already completed the discovery phase at their Lac Aux Bouleaux Graphite property in Southern Québec. Technical data has confirmed that the mine contains natural, large flake graphite, which is the type of mineral companies like Tesla will need to power car and home battery packs. Actual drilling begins this week, positioning Graphite Energy Corp. as the first domestic junior mining company to bring the mineral to the North American market. Mason Graphite secured a $45 million private placement deal in January to be used for development and construction expenses at its Lac Guéret graphite mine in Northeastern Québec. Strategic investments in graphite production are on the rise as investors realize the mineral is a key ingredient in the growth of solar power and clean tech. All this bodes well for Graphite Energy Corp.'s burgeoning operations in the hotbed of North American graphite production. Comparables: SunPower Corp. SPWR, +4.18% is a U.S. solar panel maker that has high-efficiency panels featuring SunPower's Maxeon cell technology. Based in Silicon Valley, SunPower generates over 18 million megawatt hours of solar energy. SunPower has announced a partnership with Apple (AAPL) that will result in two solar power projects totaling 40 megawatts in China'sSichuan province. Global X Lithium LIT, +1.35% The Global X Lithium & Battery Tech ETF invests in the full lithium cycle, from mining and refining the metal, through to battery production. Founded in 2008, Global X Lithium focuses on smart core, income, alpha, risk management and access suites of ETFs, with more than 50 funds available across U.S. and foreign exchanges. First Solar FSLR, +2.39% First Solar has developed, financed, engineered, constructed and currently operates many of the world's largest grid-connected photovoltaic power plants. Founded in Arizona in 1999, First Solar has experience across the solar value chain, and reduces risk while striving to deliver more reliable, dependable and cost-effective solutions.   Alcoa Corp. AA, +1.22% is a leader in the production of Bauxite, Alumina and Aluminum products. Founded in 1888 and headquartered in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Alcoa has one of the largest bauxite mining portfolios worldwide, with project locations in North America, South America, Europe, Saudi Arabia and Australia. Tesla's graphite-fueled home battery packs are setting consumers on the path to finding the best solar power solutions, and the technology has given investors a new mineral to get excited about. In the near future, competitor companies will look to match that innovation, but the secret is already out. Graphite is the key to efficiently power anything that runs on batteries, and contenders like Graphite Energy Corp. will be pivotal in meeting North America's natural graphite demand.

AA,"Mar 02, 2018 (ACCESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / March 2, 2018 / Century Aluminum, the largest producer of primary aluminum in the United States, saw big gains on Thursday after President Trump announced that his administration would be imposing aluminum tariffs. Shares of Alcoa also saw gains on the news but was reported on saying that Canada should be exempt. Canada's foreign affairs minister Chrystia Freeland remarked, ""Should restrictions be imposed on Canadian steel and aluminum products, Canada will take responsive measures to defend its trade interests and workers."" RDI Initiates Coverage on: Century Aluminum Company https://rdinvesting.com/news/?ticker=CENX Alcoa Corporation https://rdinvesting.com/news/?ticker=AA Century Aluminum's shares closed up 7.51% on almost 5.7 million shares traded on Thursday. The aluminum maker was thrilled at President Donald Trump's announcement yesterday about imposing tariffs to stop foreign aluminum imports that are destroying the aluminum industry in the U.S. President and Chief Executive Officer Michael Bless remarked, ""President Trump's commitment is critical for the U.S. aluminum industry. The President's bold leadership on the aluminum Sec. 232 will protect our country's national security and help level the playing field for thousands of American aluminum workers."" He also said, ""Thanks to the President's leadership, once the tariffs are in place, we will work with the Commonwealth of Kentucky to restart our idled Hawesville, KY smelter, including the high purity production that is so critical to our nation's defense, and bring back American jobs as soon as possible."" Access RDI's Century Aluminum Company Research Report at: https://rdinvesting.com/news/?ticker=CENX Alcoa's shares closed up 0.22% on Thursday with about 6.5 million shares traded. The aluminum giant saw a slight gain after President Trump announced yesterday that he would be imposing a hefty tariff on imported aluminum, as well as steel. The move is to protect producers in the U.S. While aluminum and steel stocks sailed into the green after the announcement, many are worried about the repercussions and the retaliation from major trade partners which include China, Europe, and Canada. Alcoa was reported as saying that it believes Canada should be exempt from the proposed steel and aluminum import tariffs. The tariffs, which include 25% on steel imports, and 10% on aluminum imports, will be formally announced by the President next week. Trump stated, ""We're going to build our steel industry back and our aluminum industry back."" Senator Pat Roberts has remarked on the negative effect the tariffs would have on the agriculture sector and said, ""Every time you do this, you get a retaliation. Agriculture is the number one target. I think this is terribly counterproductive for the agriculture economy.""

AA,"LONDON, January 29, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- LONDON, January 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FN Media Group Presents Safehaven.com News Commentary  Three years ago, the bottom dropped out of the commodities markets, and plenty of investors were ready to call it quits. Now, everything has changed. The mining sector is red-hot. In 2017, the top fifty mining companies increased in value by $141 billion , reaching a total value of $896 billion. Included in today's commentary: Newmont Mining Corporation NEM, +1.77% Royal Gold Inc. RGLD, +3.18% Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, +1.57% Alcoa Corp AA, +1.22% Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. WPM, +1.49% At the end of the year, there was a stock surge as prices shot up across the board. With the global economy booming and demand for commodities surging, there's never been a better time to jump in on the action. And the hottest entry point for this boom is gold, silver, and gemstone mining, where some companies are making big discoveries and even bigger profits. Here are five mining companies ready to ride the wave of the new commodities boom in 2018: #1 Newmont Mining Corporation NEM, +1.77% A company focused on gold and copper mining, Newmont has extensive operations in Australia and Indonesia. With a market cap of $20.5 billion, Newmont has outperformed the industry average over the last six months, rising 18 percent. The company, which employs more than 12,000 people, unearthed more than 4 million ounces of gold in 2017. And it's looking to continue that streak in 2018. Total output estimates have been revised upward, to 4.9-5.4 million ounces of gold for the year. It's expecting lower costs and higher gold prices to generate greater profits. Newmont, like fellow gold-miners Barrick and Goldcorp, has aggressively cut costs in the last few years to increase profitability, after the commodities bust of 2015. It has cut a lot of its debt and enters the new year with lower costs relative to the price of gold. That should ensure it a healthy profit margin. #2 Fura Gems ( FURA ; FUGMF) Amid the gold and the silver, it's worth noting that the global gemstone industry is doing better than ever. That's particularly notable when you compare it to the weaknesses in the diamond industry, where profits have fallen and demand seems to be drying up. Fura Gems, a mining company with a special focus on colored gemstones (emeralds, rubies and sapphires), is looking to make a splash in 2018. The company has purchased a controlling stake in the famed Coscuez Mine in Colombia. The mine, which has been a consistent producer of emeralds for more than four-hundred years, is still only 10 percent explored. At one point, it produced 77 percent of all the emeralds in Colombia, the world's leading emerald producer. That's great news when you consider its most famous stone: the massive 1759-carat Guinness emerald, one of the largest emeralds in the world. At a per-carat valuation of $9,800, the massive stone could be worth $17 million, and perhaps much, much more. While the diamond market faces a decline, colored gemstones are more popular than ever. Fura Gems hopes to capitalize on that demand by producing emeralds from its Coscsuez property and rubies from its new mine in Mozambique. The company may be small, with a market cap of only $38 million, but it's got a lot going for it. CEO Dev Shetty came to Fura from Gemfields Plc. While there, Shetty performed miracles. He took the company from a $209 million annual loss to an asset valuation of over $1 billion in over five years, through major discoveries in Colombia and Mozambique . NEWS UPDATE: Fura Gems has just released results of their ruby drilling campaign in Mozambique. Click Here for their latest release Given his track record, it's possible Shetty will bring the same success to Fura Gems. With a mere $10 million investment in Coscuez, the company could repeat Gemfields' performance: the company realized $225 million from only seven auctions. With that kind of profit potential only months away, Fura Gems could be really undervalued. #3 Royal Gold Inc. RGLD, +3.18% It was a very good year for Royal Gold Inc. last year. Despite the price of gold growing only 9 percent, the company saw its own share price increase by 38 percent. The company reported record levels of revenue and operating cash flow in FY 2017, and pumped up its dividend. A streaming and royalty-based company, Royal Gold doesn't get directly involved in mining but rather retains a portfolio of gold and silver investments that allows it to pay out dividends to investors. It has a market cap of $5.86 billion. The company owns interests in 196 properties scattered across six continents, including 39 producing mines and 23 projects in the developing stages. Now, with a fresh acquisition at the Rainy River mine in Canada, Royal Gold is poised for its best year ever. The mine is expected to produce a gold stream of 15,000 ounces and a silver stream of 1.86 million ounces, which could double the company's silver assets from FY 2017. #4 Agnico Eagle Mines Limited AEM, +1.57% Formed in 1972 through the merger of two successful mining firms, Agnico Eagle has current projects scattered across the globe, though it's mostly focused on Canada. The company's performance in 2017 was reasonably strong, as it basically matched the gold miners index (GDX) and gained around 10 percent, putting it on par with Newmont Mining. Agnico Eagle has a track-record of beating expectations. In the last quarter it exceeded its own estimates, delivering earnings of 26 cents a share instead of just 17 cents. The CEO Sean Boyd feels gold is a quality investment and a perfect way to diversify a portfolio-unlike crypto-currency, which has gotten all the attention lately. ""I'd rather own gold than bitcoin,"" Boyd told CNBC. ""It's proven itself."" Boyd feels certain gold will retain its value despite changes in technology and the current interest in alternative currencies like Bitcoin. #5 Alcoa Corp AA, +1.22% Like a lot of miners out there, Alcoa had a strong year in 2017. A firm based primarily in aluminum and bauxite mining, Alcoa saw its stock double last year, and increased its free cash flow from a low, low $3 million to an astonishing $288 million. The company's cash balance by year's end was $1.1 billion. Alcoa is the result of a split, when the old Alcoa divided its operations and spun out a new firm, Arconic. Alcoa focused entirely on aluminum, which at the time of the separation was experiencing a glut. The future for Alcoa looked grim. But now the tables have turned. The market for bauxite, aluminum and related products is strong and expected to grow even stronger in 2018. Alcoa, even while it was raking in the cash, focused on growth projects in 2017. That strategy should pay dividends in the new year, and while the stock price likely won't double again, it's sure to continue its winning streak. And while the company's performance in Q4 was a little on the underwhelming side, that's resulted in a stock price dip that gives investors a golden opportunity. Honorable Mentions: Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. WPM, +1.49% is Canadian precious metals streaming company, focusing primarily on gold and silver sales. The company produces a massive 26 million ounces of silver, and sells over 29 million, produced by the links of industry giants Barrick Gold and Goldcorp. The company's agreements span across North and South America, with the majority being in Mexico. By. Charles Kennedy**IMPORTANT! BY READING OUR CONTENT YOU EXPLICITLY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING.

This morning, Alcoa most recent news is on our radar and our team decided to put out a fantastic report on the company that is now available for free below: www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=AA Earnings Highlights and Summary Alcoa reported revenues of $3.17 billion for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year 2017, up 25% compared to $2.54 billion in Q4 2016. However, the Company's revenue numbers fell short of analysts' estimates of $3.38 billion. For FY17, Alcoa's revenue totaled $11.64 billion, up 25% compared to $9.32 billion in FY16, reflecting higher alumina and aluminum pricing. During Q4 2017, Alcoa reported a net loss of $196 million, or $1.06 per share, compared to a net loss of $125 million, or $0.68 per share, in Q4 2016. The Company's reported quarter results included $391 million of special items, primarily attributed to actions relating to the Rockdale Operations and the Portovesme smelter. Other special items included charges for income tax valuation allowance and tax rate change adjustments, as well as certain impacts from new US income tax legislation, and costs for the partial restart of the Warrick smelter in Indiana. Excluding the impact of special items, Alcoa's adjusted net income was $195 million, or $1.04 per share, for Q4 2017 compared to $$26 million, or $0.14 per share, for Q4 2016. The Company's earnings numbers lagged Wall Street's estimates of $1.23 per share. For Q4 2017, Alcoa's adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), excluding special items, rose 131% to $775 million compared to $335 million in Q4 2016. The improvement was primarily driven by increased pricing for both alumina and aluminum, partially offset by higher energy costs. For the full year 2017, Alcoa reported a net income of $217 million, or $1.16 per share, compared to a net loss of $400 million, or $2.19 loss per share, for the full year 2016. Excluding special items, the Company reported an adjusted net income of $563 million, or $3.01 per share, in FY17 compared to an adjusted net loss of $227 million, or $1.24 per share, in FY16. Cash Matters Alcoa's cash from operations was $455 million and free cash flow was $305 million in Q4 2017. The Company's cash used for financing activities and investing activities was $53 million and $170 million, respectively, in the reported quarter. Alcoa ended Q4 2017 with cash on hand of $1.36 billion with $1.41 billion of debt, for a net debt of $0.05 billion. The Company reported working capital of 11 days at the end of Q4 2017, a 3-day improvement on a y-o-y basis. Market Update For 2018, Alcoa is forecasting balanced global bauxite and alumina markets and a global aluminum deficit of 300,000 to 700,000 metric tons. Alcoa is projecting 2018 global aluminum demand growth of 4.25% to 5.25%, following the Company's final 2017 global demand growth rate of 5.25%. Alcoa is estimating full-year 2018 adjusted EBITDA, excluding special items, to range between $2.6 billion and $2.8 billion.

AA,"PITTSBURGH, Dec 21, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Alcoa Corporation, a global leader in bauxite, alumina and aluminum products, today announced decisions regarding smelting assets in the United States and Italy. The actions support the Company’s strategic priorities to reduce complexity and to strengthen the balance sheet. In the United States, Alcoa intends to permanently close its Rockdale Operations site in Texas, which has been fully curtailed since the end of 2008. The site includes a primary aluminum smelter and casthouse, an aluminum powder plant and associated buildings and equipment. Alcoa’s strategic review of these assets, announced earlier this year, concluded that these operations have limited economic prospects. Separately, the Company continues to market for sale more than 30,000 acres of land at the Rockdale site. In Italy, Alcoa has reached an agreement to divest the Portovesme primary aluminum smelter, fully curtailed since 2012 and closed since 2014, to Invitalia, the Italian government agency that manages economic development. As part of the agreement, Alcoa and the Italian government have settled matters related to past energy tariffs, including the Italian Energy Authority Regulation 148/2004 matter, and a groundwater remediation project. “We continuously evaluate our portfolio of global assets against many factors to optimize value,” said President and Chief Executive Officer Roy Harvey. “Achieving a resolution on these two assets further streamlines our Company as we continue to execute against our strategic priorities.” The Company will record an estimated charge of $55 million (pre- and after-tax) in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with the permanent closure of Rockdale. In addition, the Company will record an estimated $22 million (pre- and after-tax) reserve reduction in the fourth quarter of 2017 associated with a reserve established at the end of 2015 for the Italy matter. The net earnings impact of the two actions is estimated to be a negative $0.18 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company anticipates annual adjusted EBITDA benefits of approximately $3 million upon completion of the Rockdale decommissioning in 2022, and of approximately $4 million upon completion of the Portovesme divestiture in 2018. Cash outlays for the Rockdale closure are expected to be approximately $53 million over the next five years, including holding and demolition costs, with approximately $16 million in 2018. Cash outlays for the Italy settlement, including the pre-existing 148/2004 matter and remediation reserves, are expected to be between $40 million and $50 million over the next five years, with approximately $10 million in 2018.

Additional information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements is contained in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company disclaims any obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements, whether in response to new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by applicable law. Adjusted EBITDA Definition Alcoa Corporation’s definition of Adjusted EBITDA is net margin plus an add-back for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Net margin is equivalent to Sales minus the following items: Cost of goods sold; Selling, general administrative, and other expenses; Research and development expenses; and Provision for depreciation, depletion, and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that this measure is meaningful to investors because Adjusted EBITDA provides additional information with respect to Alcoa Corporation’s operating performance and the Company’s ability to meet its financial obligations. The Adjusted EBITDA presented may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies. Alcoa Corporation has not provided a reconciliation of the forward-looking Adjusted EBITDA amounts included in this release to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures due primarily to the variability and complexity in making accurate forecasts and projections, as not all of the information for a quantitative reconciliation is available to the company without unreasonable effort.

The amendment on the revolving credit agreement eases certain financial covenants to provide greater flexibility for the Company in a range of areas, including expanded options for permitted debt and investments. “In our first year as an independent company, we’ve realized solid financial performance supported by favorable market conditions,” said William Oplinger, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. “The amendment to the revolving credit agreement is a recognition of our strengthened financial position, and the improved terms provide greater latitude to deliver on our strategic priorities to reduce complexity, drive returns and strengthen the balance sheet.” The amended revolving credit agreement also provides more flexibility for Alcoa to execute its capital allocation strategy. “As a commodity company, we will maintain a conservative strategy for capital allocation that places a priority on maintaining a healthy cash balance, sustaining current operations and then investing in return seeking projects,” Oplinger said. “After meeting those objectives and our obligations, we aim to return cash to our stockholders in a sustainable way.” Alcoa Corporation, Alcoa Nederland Holding B.V. and 24 participating financial institutions finalized the amended revolving credit agreement on November 14, 2017. The agreement extends the maturity date from November 1, 2021 to November 14, 2022. JPMorgan Chase Bank serves as the administrative agent.
