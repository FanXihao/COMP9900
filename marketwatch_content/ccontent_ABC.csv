ABC,"Nathaniel Killgore, a graphic designer living in Alabama, was bleeding internally. The painful bleeds, in his knees and arms, began while he was moving to a new state. He couldn’t get around, and was in extreme pain. Killgore, who was born with hemophilia, knew that clotting factor would help stop the bleeding and pain. He had previously used a co-pay coupon provided by the factor’s manufacturer to afford the prescription, but it wasn’t working this time. To get his life-sustaining medication, Killgore needed to pay his $6,500 health insurance deductible in full, the pharmacy told him. It was money Killgore and his wife, Lauren, already grappling with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student and medical debt, just didn’t have. Lauren asked a customer service representative about a payment plan, and was advised to borrow money from family or take it out in credit cards. Killgore ended up being hospitalized and needing surgery, something that taking the factor would have completely avoided. “Two kids straight out of school, fresh married, we did not — who has $6,500, you know?” Lauren Killgore said. “We felt like we had hit rock bottom, and there was no way to excel in life, no way to be debt-free ever; no way to have medication at home for him. We just hit a wall.” Read more: Like using that drug coupon? Its days may be numbered Drugs for hemophilia and other complex diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis, cancer, rare diseases and more are some of the most expensive medications in the U.S. The shift to high-deductible health plans means that even insured individuals are increasingly paying more drug costs out of their own pockets. See: This is what your health insurance looks like this year Many patients on these expensive medications, called specialty drugs, have become reliant on co-pay coupons provided by the manufacturers of their drugs. The coupons have helped patients blow through their increasingly large deductibles, minimize co-pays and even meet out-of-pocket requirements. Co-pay cards are “just the way people with HIV get their drugs,” said Carl Schmid, deputy executive director of The AIDS Institute, “because the deductibles and co-pays are just so high and they’re getting worse. It’s a given.” New co-pay accumulator programs, however, are cracking down on the practice. Patients are still able to use the co-pay coupons for some period of time, experts say, but they eventually exhaust the amount financed by the drugmaker and then must pay the deductible in full, along with any relevant co-pay and coinsurance. Co-pay accumulators appear to have first emerged in 2017, but have become much more common this year, used by prominent health care players like insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06% and pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co. ESRX, -0.93% Co-pay accumulators could be built into as much as 20% of commercial health policies sold in 2018, according to one estimate. That popularity, combined with their design, means many patients may only realize they are affected by co-pay accumulators in the next month or two, creating a pressing financial issue with no clear or immediate solution, patient advocates say. “I knew this was going to become our nightmare,” said Kollet Koulianos, the National Hemophilia Foundation’s senior director of payer relations. Xcenda Many health plans are considering limiting co-pay coupon use, according to a 2017 survey of 46 national and regional commercial plans done by AmerisourceBergen Corp.  subsidiary Xcenda. Xcenda Some drug categories are more likely to be targeted by programs limiting co-pay coupons, especially if they have high out-of-pocket expenses and a lot of co-pay coupon programs, according to a 2017 report by AmerisourceBergen’s Xcenda. Co-pay coupons have been censured for driving patients away from cheap generic drugs to more expensive medications, pushing overall health care costs up. Health plans and pharmacy middlemen say that’s what they’re responding to. Co-pay coupons are a “sham” hiding the true cost of medications, and co-pay accumulators merely help “better reflect actual patient out-of-pocket costs,” America’s Health Insurance Plans spokesperson Cathryn Donaldson said. Moreover, pharmaceutical companies could provide additional co-pay coupon assistance if they wanted to, Donaldson suggested. See: The real reason drug makers offer discount cards (you’ll pay eventually) Ultimately, “there is only one entity that makes drugs unaffordable or inaccessible — pharmaceutical manufacturers,” Donaldson said. “Patients should not be paying such high prices for their medications.” But low-cost generic alternatives aren’t an option for many of the patients affected by co-pay accumulators, including for HIV, rheumatoid arthritis and hemophilia therapies, experts said. In multiple sclerosis, which has some but not many generic alternatives, the generic doesn’t always work as well for the patient, said Kyle Pinion, director of advocacy and public policy at the Multiple Sclerosis Association of America. And although lower-cost biosimilar medications for rheumatoid arthritis are slowly making their way to market, it’s unclear whether co-pay accumulators affect those products any differently, said Anna Hyde, vice president of advocacy and access at the Arthritis Foundation. “Patients aren’t choosing between expensive drugs and cheap drugs. They’re choosing between expensive drugs and no drugs,” said Howard Deutsch, who works with drug companies as principal, managed care practice lead at the firm ZS Associates. Read: Drug companies are beginning to wake up to this new risk factor Why Big Pharma Is Turning to Biological Drugs Still, within a drug class, there may be a cheaper drug for the health plan, said Mark Merritt, president and chief executive of PBM industry group, the Pharmaceutical Care Management Association, since that’s commonly the role played by pharmacy-benefit managers, middlemen that negotiate drug prices, he said. But advocates say this could still stop patients from taking their medications, harming their health in the process. Many Americans can’t afford to pay thousands of dollars out of pocket, they noted. Without access to their daily medications, individuals with HIV can get sick and die, The AIDS Institute’s Schmid said. There are also public health implications, since treatment prevents the virus from being spread, he said. He is also concerned about availability of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), which can prevent high-risk individuals from getting HIV and also has no generic alternative. Many arthritis patients have chosen not to fill their prescriptions, the Arthritis Foundation’s Hyde said. Though there are third-party patient assistance charities out there, those might not be an option for most people, Hyde said. Patients have also asked their doctors to be put on a different drug for which they can, for a time, use another co-pay coupon. This kind of medication-hopping isn’t advisable but “some patients would not feel like they have another option,” Hyde said. Some individuals, though, have managed to pay the deductible, or secured some other option. Nathaniel Killgore later found out that because he is of American Indian heritage, his medical bills would be taken care of. But he and Lauren know there are others affected who may not be as lucky, including in their own family. Killgore’s uncle, who also has hemophilia and is not American Indian, has a co-pay accumulator in his health plan.

ABC,"Cigna Corp.’s $67 billion acquisition of middleman pharmacy-benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Company, announced Thursday, marks the veritable end of independent drug price negotiation in the health-care industry. Express Scripts ESRX, -0.93%  is the largest stand-alone pharmacy-benefit manager, one of a group of middlemen that represent health insurers and employers in deal making with drug manufacturers. Though they push in these talks for lower prices, pharmacy-benefit managers have also been accused of helping drive drug prices up and profiting off it, even as consumers and employers get squeezed by expensive health costs. The latest Cigna CI, -0.34%  -Express Scripts deal represents the tail end of independent drug price negotiations, with pharmacy-benefit managers now largely having merged into health insurers. Cigna shares dropped 11.5% in Thursday morning trade while Express Scripts shares surged 8.6%. See: Cigna to buy Express Scripts in deal worth $67 billion Late last year, for example, pharmacy chain and pharmacy-benefit manager CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.80%   announced a $69 billion acquisition of health insurer Aetna Inc. “It has been our long-held belief that stand-alone PBMs had no future,” said Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte, because drug spending has become a key component of rising health-care costs, and networks are increasingly seen a way to control the cost of expensive specialty drugs. Whether such deals will raise or lower prices for consumers is still unclear. But they do mark a fundamental shift in how drug prices are determined, bearing implications for the health-care industry as a whole. Read more: U.S. health care is changing in a big way. The CVS-Aetna deal shows how Express Scripts itself has been facing trouble for some time. The pharmacy-benefit manager lost its longtime client, health insurer Anthem Inc. ANTM, -0.80%  , in an unusually public way last year. After claiming that Express Scripts had been overcharging it, Anthem announced plans to create its own pharmacy-benefit manager in partnership with CVS Health. That fed into a long-term trend of health insurers having in-house pharmacy-benefit managers, which translated to fewer potential clients and more pressure on Express Scripts. See: 3 reasons Express Scripts could be headed for trouble There are still lingering questions about whether health insurer-pharmacy-benefit manager deals will go through, with the clear possibility of antitrust scrutiny. But if successful, the deals could result in some changes. Saving on health costs is a clear goal, which companies believe they can achieve by bringing medical and pharmaceutical treatments closer together for better outcomes. Dysfunctions in the drug industry could also be more in the hands of health insurers to address, redrawing battle lines more directly between drugmakers and health insurers. The first such signal came this week, when UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06%  — which has an in-house pharmacy-benefit manager — said it would pass some rebates from drugmakers on to consumers, The Wall Street Journal reported, which could serve to make drug prices more affordable. Cigna has so far contracted pharmacy-benefit management services with UnitedHealth’s in-house Optum Rx. UnitedHealth shares dipped 0.1% in Thursday trade, and shares of other health insurers — including Anthem, Aetna Inc. AET, -0.25%   and Humana Inc. HUM, +0.48%   — also dipped slightly. Shares of other players in the drug supply chain rose, including McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  , AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  , Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94%  , CVS Health Corp.

ABC,"Amazon.com has been one of the most innovative and disruptive companies of this century, with incredible success in areas that lie outside of what has been historically perceived as its core business (book selling). Thus every announcement or speculation that Amazon AMZN, +1.11%  will enter into a particular industry sends stocks of that industry into a tailspin. Investors sell first and ask questions later. When Amazon announced its purchase of Whole Foods, grocery stores declined as much as 30%. Even Tesco TSCO, +0.15% separated by an ocean from Whole Foods, was down on that news. A big part of Amazon’s success has come from not being taken seriously by its competition. Amazon was able to create a huge lead in AWS (Amazon Web Services) because the competition (Alphabet GOOGL, +3.18%  and Microsoft MSFT, +2.10%  did not give Amazon enough respect. Competitors thought, “what does a book seller know about the cloud?” Well, according to Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, such thinking gave Amazon a much bigger lead over its rivals. Today, everyone takes Amazon seriously. Indeed, fear of Amazon is reaching paranoia levels. McKesson MCK, +0.15%  shares, for example, took a 20% dive during the fourth quarter of 2017 on speculation that Amazon would start distributing pharmaceuticals in the U.S. As McKesson shareholders, my firm took this speculation seriously, but upon further investigation, it became evident that such concerns were overblown. After the market cooled off from fourth-quarter worry about Amazon, McKesson shares recovered. Then in late January, news that Amazon, JPMorgan Chase JPM, +1.82%  , and Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRK.A, +1.04% BRK.B, +1.43%  will join forces to drive down U.S. health-care costs hit health-care sector stocks, including McKesson. TimeMcKesson Corp.Nov 17Dec 17Jan 18Feb 18Mar 18 US:MCK $140 $150 $160 $170 How big of a punch could this be? McKesson is the largest distributor of pharmaceuticals in the U.S. Its 2018 sales are on track to exceed $210 billion. It is important to point out that McKesson is not a retailer but a distributor. It is one of three railroads for drugs in the U.S. McKesson distributes drugs to thousands of independent pharmacies, as well as giants like CVS Health CVS, -0.80%  , Rite Aid RTA, +7.38%  and Walmart WMT, +1.37% McKesson operates two distinct distribution businesses: branded and generics. Though these businesses may look similar on the surface, the economic models of branded and generic businesses are quite different. In the distribution of branded drugs (about 70% of McKesson’s revenue and 30% of profits) McKesson has a fee-for-service model. Pharmaceutical companies want to be involved in high-value activities: chiefly, inventing and manufacturing drugs. Getting drugs to thousands of pharmacies on a timely basis and collecting accounts receivable is not the business they want to be in. They don’t have the scale and distribution know-how of McKesson, Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94%  , and AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29%  — that collectively control 90% of drug distribution in the U.S. Thus the likes Pfizer PFE, +0.54%  and Bristol-Meyers Squibb BMY, +1.09%  pay drug distributors a small “fee for service,” and pharmaceutical companies (not distributors) negotiate prices with pharmacies. More than 90% of McKesson’s profit in this segment is driven by volume, while just 10% is linked to changes in drug prices. Pfizer, for instance, despite its might, would still have higher distribution costs than McKesson because it doesn’t have McKesson’s scale and focus on distribution efficiency. So Pfizer is happy to pay McKesson this service fee and not think about drug distribution. In its generic drug distribution business (about 30% of sales, 70% of earnings), McKesson uses its enormous buying power to buy drugs at low prices from generics manufacturers and sell at higher prices to pharmacies. Since it can source the same drug from various manufacturers, it leverages better prices from the likes of Mylan MYL, +1.65%  and Teva Pharmaceuticals Industries TEVA, +0.29%  . Drug distributors are a significant deflationary force in generic pricing — good for consumers, not great for Teva or Mylan. So McKesson has a wide protective moat, which includes the distinct possibility that Amazon’s adventure into drug distribution could lead to miserable failure. Here’s why: 1. Amazon cannot match McKesson’s buying power or negotiating power when it comes to generics. Current Amazon sales of pharmaceuticals are somewhere between zero and slightly above zero. McKesson’s sales are pushing $210 billion, about $65 billion of which comes from generics. Walmart is the fourth-largest pharmacy in the U.S., with sales of $20 billion. It had distributed drugs, but in 2016 it signed a distribution deal with McKesson. Walmart realized it could get better prices for generics through McKesson. Amazon, with near-zero sales, doesn’t stand a chance. Read: Amazon is aiming to become a major hospital supplier 2. Amazon has no structural advantage. In the fight against Barnes & Noble BKS, +1.02%   and Best Buy BBY, +2.09%  , Amazon could charge lower prices than brick-and-mortar retailers because it had a structural advantage — it did not own stores and have all the extra costs associated with them. On one of his conference calls, McKesson CEO John Hammergren said his company was Amazon before Amazon was Amazon. Indeed. McKesson has highly specialized warehouses designed to distribute drugs. It can get any drug to any pharmacy in the U.S. within hours. 3. McKesson’s pretax margins are just 1.7%. If Amazon is looking to cut fat in the pharmaceutical industry, this is not where the fat is. 4. Distributing and selling drugs is not like selling or distributing most anything else. First, some drugs require refrigeration and others are controlled substances. Distributing them puts an extra regulatory (and self-policing) burden on distributors. McKesson has paid fines and recently received plenty of negative publicity from “60 Minutes” for distributing opioid pain medications to legal pharmacies who illegally sold the medicine on the black market. Second, unlike in almost any other industry, pharma consumers are price-insensitive. If you are on Medicare, Medicaid, or a copay/low-deductible private insurance plan, you really don’t care if you are paying the lowest price because you don’t see the price (other than for copay). For this group of drug consumers, which constitutes the bulk of the U.S. population, lower drug prices are not an incentive to switch. Moreover, let’s say Amazon starts an online pharmacy and self-distributes. Internet-savvy millennials are not the ones consuming most of the drugs in the U.S. Their parents and grandparents are. This demographic still has brick-and-mortar habits that are less likely to be broken anytime soon. Also, major pharmacies already have mail-order operations. It would be logical for Amazon to try to get into the almost-trillion-dollar pharma business, but its success here will be limited, and it will take decades to gain a meaningful market share 5. Suppose Amazon opens an online pharmacy and succeeds. It would probably take five to 10 years to reach sales of, let’s say, $10 billion (half of Walmart’s current drug sales). Let’s assume that Amazon self-distributes and will not use McKesson, or that it decides to employ the services of Cardinal Health. This would steal less than a year of current growth from McKesson, in five to 10 years. Here's how much money you need to last for your entire life Put simply, the laws of economics still apply — even to Amazon. Drug distributors are strong financially and have great scale and a tremendous purchasing-power advantage. Distributors’ stocks may take a dive but their business will be fine in the long run. The only competitive advantage Amazon has against drug distributors is that Wall Street completely ignores its profitability and focuses only on revenue growth. McKesson is one of the U.S. stock market’s most interesting investments. Its business is future-proof. The demand for its product is not cyclical and is likely to continue to grow as the U.S. population ages. Higher or lower interest rates, recession or no recession, inflation or deflation, McKesson’s earnings power will continue to march ahead for a long time. McKesson has a conservative balance sheet; it can pay off its debt in less than two years. McKesson pays a lower dividend than its competitors, but it has purchased a third of its shares over the last decade. Expected earnings of about $13 a share this year could grow to $15 in 2019. At a conservative 15 times earnings, McKesson is worth about $225 a share. However, McKesson has spun off its technology business into Change Healthcare, which could go public in 2019. McKesson owns 70% of Change Healthcare, and my firm estimates McKesson’s interest is worth about $25-$30 a share. Thus, a conservative estimate of McKesson’s value is about $250. Accordingly, my firm took advantage of recent weakness in McKesson’s shares and increased our position. So, how does one invest in this overvalued stock market? Our strategy is spelled out in this fairly lengthy article. Vitaliy Katsenelson is chief investment officer at  Investment Management Associates  in Denver, Colo., which has a portfolio position in McKesson.

Need to know: ‘Risks of a recession’ are rising, says Ray Dalio What’s driving the markets? Opinion: Blame machines for the stock market’s wild swings, but the response is all on you The next big catalyst for the market could come from Wednesday’s January consumer-price-inflation data. There are concerns that if CPI comes in hotter than expected, it could spark another selloff, as worries about higher prices and its effect on the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hiking plans triggered last week’s dramatic selling and spike in volatility. See: Why Valentine’s Day may represent the next big test for the stock market Economists polled by MarketWatch are expecting a 0.4% rise for headline inflation, and a 0.2% gain for core inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices. Investors have also been considering a $4.4 trillion federal budget that U.S. President Donald Trump has proposed, which would see the deficit nearly double in 2017 and rise some $7 trillion over the next decade. Of course, few expect the budget in its current form will be enacted by Congress, especially given that it pushes for deep cuts in social programs. But the tax cuts signed into law in December and the spending deal reached last week are already seen as adding to the deficit. Read: Here’s the nagging question at the heart of the stock-market selloff What are strategists saying? “I would characterize today’s activity as nothing more than investors, both long and short, taking a rest and they are waiting for CPI to get the next data on inflation,” said Ian Winer, head of the equities division at Wedbush Securities. “It has been a really violent last couple of weeks,” he said. “If inflation continues to pick up, the equity market will continue to struggle from here. If worries about inflation come true, the problem is that central banks will have no choice but to raise rates, which won’t just have an impact on the equity markets but also on the real economy,” said Nick Clay, the lead manager of the Dreyfus Global Equity Income Fund. “The recent 10% correction basically just unwound the gains we saw over January. Valuations remain high; the U.S. is one of the most expensive markets in the world. I think volatility will remain elevated, and we could easily see another 15% downside. Only then will valuations start to become a little more reasonable.” Correction refers to the market’s fall of at least 10% from a recent peak, which is the typical characterization for such a drop from a peak.

For some investors, the right “entry point” kept slipping further away as the market rose, almost endlessly, since the bull market began about nine years ago.

Ray Dalio did exactly that, saying anyone hiding out in cash would “feel pretty stupid”— and so now he’s sounding more bearish as he provides our call of the day. “The risks of a recession in the next 18-24 months are rising,” writes the billionaire founder of Bridgewater Associates in a LinkedIn post. The odds are growing for a recession because we are in the part of the economic cycle where it’s difficult for central banks to get monetary policy right, and this time around their balancing act will be especially tricky, he says. (That echoes his July warning about central banks making mistakes.) So what did he get wrong earlier this year? He describes his pre-selloff thinking as follows: “If the spurt in growth in profits (which is good for equities) is faster than the rise in interest rates (which is bad for asset prices) that will be marginally bullish, and if there is a lot of cash still on the sidelines (which there is) that causes one last spurt in equities prices.” And here’s why equities slumped instead, according to Dalio (who really likes the word “spurt”): “Recent spurts in stimulations, growth and wage numbers signaled that the cycle is a bit ahead of where I thought it was. These reports understandably led to the reactions in bonds, which affected stocks as they did.” Go here to read the full post from the head of the world’s largest hedge fund, which is shorting Adidas, Siemens and other European stocks as exec Bob Prince sees “a much bigger shakeout coming.” Read: Here’s the nagging question at the heart of the stock-market selloff Key market gauges Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:YMH8  , S&P 500 US:ESH8  and Nasdaq-100 US:NQH8 are pointing down.

ABC,"Hospital systems are trying something new in an effort to shake up U.S. drug pricing and combat longtime drug shortages, starting their own nonprofit generic drug manufacturer, the New York Times reports. The Thursday news seemed to herald doom for generic drug manufacturers like Mylan NV MYL, +1.65%  , Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA, +0.29%  and Endo International PLC ENDP, +1.71%  , and their shares fell in heavy trade. The VanEck Vectors Generic Drugs ETF GNRX, -1.31%  declined 1.3% in extremely heavy trade. But many industry observers say it’s easier said than done. Setting up shop in the generic industry will be difficult and take some time, they say, factors that limit the risk to generic drugmakers. The hospitals also plan to focus on select drugs, another factor that should limit industry damage, experts said. About 300 hospitals have signed on to the initiative, which is led by the Utah-based nonprofit hospital system Intermountain Healthcare and aims to manufacture generic drugs for hospital use, according to the Times report. They would eventually consider selling to others as well, the report said. The group will focus only on drugs “where there are problems,” Intermountain Healthcare Chief Executive Marc Harrison told the Times, especially situations in which old drugs’ prices have been hiked substantially or where there are shortages of key products. Executives wouldn’t specify which products, though, for fear of competitors undercutting them — at least in the short term — on price, according to the Times. Getting started in the generics business is doable, but it’ll realistically take about 18 to 24 months to make a product and get it approved, Spencer Perlman, director of health-care research at Veda Partners, told MarketWatch. That timeline would make it difficult to quickly enter a new market as a shortage or pricing issues arise, and could give rivals a head start to undercut them on price, he said. Also, on the whole generic drugs are less expensive than new, complex drugs called biologics, though there are some clear exceptions to the rule. See: Lost beneath headlines of five-figure drug costs — pharmaceutical price growth is weakening Though a generic drugmaker could make cheaper versions of those drugs, called biosimilars, “there is an exponentially higher level of sophistication that is required to replicate a biologic,” Perlman said. Related: These drugs could cut American health costs by $250 billion (if only we could take them) Because the hospital initiative is expected to focus on select drugs, Wall Street analysts said it represents minimal impact to generic drugmakers as well as the drug supply chain. “We believe there are certain situations where the hospitals’ solution could be successful, particularly in providing a more reliable supply for certain products that have frequent shortages,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill. “The hospitals’ solution could also be successful to address large increases in drug prices, depending on how quickly the new company is able to react and ramp up competition.” But for drugs with FDA exclusivity, “it is less likely the company will provide any competition or price relief,” he added. Others questioned whether hospitals could even swing it, financially. “We believe that start up costs associated with setting up an actual generics company (with scientific, regulators, and legal departments and plants) may prove cost prohibitive to hospitals,” said Mizuho analyst Irina Koffler. Generic competition has already been ramping up, spurred by encouragement from the FDA and faster-than-usual approvals, so it’s possible that generics manufacturers may already be working in areas of shortage or over-pricing, Koffler said. Read more: Teva’s new plan is to raise drug prices, but it won’t be easy and Mylan sees opportunity in rival Teva’s weakness However, some of the industry’s pricing and shortage problems have persisted for many years, such as with IV saline solution, which the FDA added to the drug shortage list in 2013. Meanwhile, the generic drug industry has been struggling because of lower generics prices, slower sales, more competition and consolidation among purchasing groups. These challenges might even compound shortage issues. Teva — the largest generic drugmaker — announced a slew of cost cuts late last year, including plans to raise prices on some products and discontinuing others. Shares of generic drugmaker Perrigo Co. PRGO, +0.90%  declined 0.6% in Thursday trade, and Teligent TLGT, -1.75%  shares dropped 6.5%. Drug distributors McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  , Cardinal Health Inc.

ABC,"This year’s flu season is expected to be the worst in recent history. But Wall Street sees a silver lining: More prescriptions and patients going to the hospital could provide a lift for various health care companies. Specifically in the cough, cold and flu category, prescriptions grew nearly 20% year-over-year in December, according to a recent report by Raymond James analysts. That demand is also expected to continue “as experts anticipate flu season getting worse over the next couple months,” RBC Capital Markets analyst George Hill said. For the drug supply chain, “catching cold is a good thing,” Hill said, citing CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.80% Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, -3.14%  and Rite Aid Corp. RAD, +0.60%  as particular beneficiaries. Other drug supply chain companies include distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94%  and McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15% Read: This year’s flu season could be the most deadly in years — and the most expensive Flu season is typically a trend that affects prescription drug volume at this time of year. For example, an active flu season drove prescribing in 2013, while a weak flu season in late 2011 and early 2013 did the opposite, Raymond James analysts noted in a recent report. Hospitals also experienced growth this past December, with the flu likely driving higher emergency room and inpatient admissions, according to a J.P. Morgan hospital survey released on Wednesday. J.P. Morgan Because of the flu’s geographic spread, high flu activity could be expected at hospital chains HCA Healthcare Inc. HCA, -0.15% LifePoint Health Inc. LPNT, -1.67%  and Universal Health Services UHS, -2.45% according to BMO Capital Markets analyst Matt Borsch. However, flu-related business won’t necessarily be profitable across the board, RBC Capital Markets analyst Frank Morgan said. For acute care hospitals, flu is a “lower-revenue and lower-margin business,"" he said; it’s also a headwind for the senior housing industry. Related: Why the flu vaccine could be getting better CDC via J.P. Morgan One group that certainly don’t benefit from flu season: Health insurers.

ABC,"Online retailer Amazon.com Inc., which is reportedly mulling a larger entry into health care, is notorious for its low prices. But when it comes to medical distribution, incumbent industry leader Cardinal Health Inc. said that price is actually its advantage. Because of the distributor’s scale and size, the “price we’re selling at today is significantly, and I mean significantly, lower that what else is out there,” Chief Executive Mike Kaufmann said, adding that “it would be hard” for someone else to beat it. See more: Is Amazon getting into the pharmacy business? This is what you need to know For example, when Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94%  ships gloves to a medical facility, it ships pallets of them rather than boxes, Kaufmann said. Medical products also can’t be commoditized like other retail areas, Cardinal Health management said, since doctors can have very specific preferences. They also suggested that Amazon AMZN, +1.11%  would be at a disadvantage because much of Cardinal Health’s medical segment profits are outside of the U.S. Read: There’s a surprisingly messy backstory to Amazon’s health care quest The remarks, made Monday at the J.P. Morgan Health Care Conference in San Francisco, the largest industry conference of the year, illustrate the way that Amazon’s potential entry into the sector continues to cast a pall over Cardinal Health and other health-care distributors. In a presentation at the conference, Kaufmann — the company’s newly-minted CEO — emphasized the range of services that Cardinal Health offers, including medical and surgical products “distributed five times a week in semi-truck loads,” inventory management services and generic and specialty medications, among other things. Shares of Cardinal Health and rivals AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  and McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  have been pressured by reports of a possible Amazon entry — even though Amazon hasn’t even confirmed an interest in the space, and it’s unclear what shape such a move would take. Amazon did not immediately return MarketWatch’s request for comment. Related: Amazon wants to disrupt the neighborhood pharmacy—but its sketchy health products could get in the way In November, Morgan Stanley declared Cardinal Health most at risk in the case of an Amazon entry, followed by McKesson, because of their earnings exposure risk.

ABC,"Online retailer Amazon.com Inc. has a reputation for a take-no-prisoners approach in its disruption of new industries. However, in its entry into health care distribution, which is rife with regulatory complexity, the online retailer has stumbled quite a bit, records obtained by MarketWatch show. Amid speculation about Amazon AMZN, +1.11%  having bigger health care ambitions, the paper trail also reveals a surprisingly chaotic backstory to Amazon’s work in this area, suggesting its dominance there is not as inevitable as has been assumed. Amazon was denied a pharmacy board license in California early this year because it did not meet a regulatory requirement, for example, and applied for one in Maine, even though the state doesn’t license device distributors. The records show that “in the short term, Amazon doesn’t have the ability to disrupt this supply chain,” Nicodemo Fiorentino, a pharmaceutical and medical device regulatory expert, told MarketWatch. “Right now it’s a mess.” Related: Amazon wants to disrupt the neighborhood pharmacy—but its sketchy health products could get in the way The threat of Amazon’s health care expansion — especially into the realm of pharmaceutical drugs — has pressured stocks of companies in the pharmaceutical supply chain for months. But when asked about its health care plans, Amazon has previously cited its practice of “declining to comment on rumors and speculation.” Recent applications for licenses from state pharmacy boards, 13 total as of late June, seemed to confirm that Amazon was expanding into health care. They included general manufacturer or wholesaler licenses, licenses that specify medical devices and ones that specify drug distribution, and were issued as early as October 2016. Read: Is Amazon getting into the pharmacy business? This is what you need to know But Amazon told MarketWatch that the licenses were for Amazon’s professional-use products, which are sold to hospitals and medical and dental offices and include such products as syringes, point-of-care tests and dental tools. The program is currently available in many, but not all U.S. states, according to Amazon’s website. States have different licensing requirements for companies that want to distribute health care products. But what a license actually covers varies by state, and some states — about half — don’t even license non-resident device distributors, Fiorentino said. Maine is one of those states. In various parts of its Maine pharmacy board application, Amazon said that it is interested in distributing prescription medical devices. Why Competing With Netflix and Amazon Is Impossible Maine then canceled Amazon’s license application — possibly because the state simply doesn’t license device distributors, Fiorentino said. Amazon also faced trouble in Utah, failing to provide fingerprints for two individuals as part of the company’s application. Utah’s licensing division thus gave Amazon a conditional denial in April, saying the application was incomplete, records show. In California, the state’s pharmacy board wouldn’t process Amazon’s licensing application any further because it had not met a regulatory requirement for its three Indiana facilities. See: Amazon is pressuring drug stocks without lifting a finger The crux of the problem: Indiana does not license medical device wholesalers, and California’s licensing process requires companies to have what’s called a “home state license.” There are ways — albeit complicated and/or expensive — to move past this, and Amazon can always reapply for the California licenses, Fiorentino told MarketWatch. But the company now needs to disclose its California denial on state license applications, like it did on the Maine one, and that does hurt them, he said. The Indiana facilities could prove problematic for licensing in other states too, he added. “Between Maine and California, it’s like — whoever is in charge of this process for Amazon, do they actually know what they’re doing?” Fiorentino said. Amazon has struggled to break into highly regulated markets, including China and has a limited presence in U.S. alcohol distribution, Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes has noted.

ABC,"Shares of generic drug manufacturers rose Friday following a report Amazon.com Inc. has held conversations with Mylan NV and Sandoz, a Novartis AG unit, about potentially entering the pharmacy market. Meanwhile, drugstores, pharmacy-benefit managers, and distributors are seeing their stocks fall amid concerns that Amazon will provide new competition and disrupt their business models. CNBC reported late Thursday that the Mylan and Sandoz have engaged in “high level” talks and added that it is still unclear what Amazon’s AMZN, +1.11%  pharmacy ambitions are. “This means that Amazon may be simultaneously exploring either opening a retail pharmacy or drug distribution business,” analyst Brian Nowak at Morgan Stanley wrote in a note to clients.

ABC,"Amazon.com: books, music, movies, apparel, food — and prescription medicine? A report earlier this year that the massive online retailer was mulling a pharmaceutical-industry entry has had observers all aflutter. Amazon’s AMZN, +1.11% nearly $14 billion acquisition of Whole Foods, announced in June and closed just over two months later, sparked speculation that the grocery chain might soon house pharmacy locations. Though Amazon itself has not confirmed a potential expansion into pharmaceuticals, the possibility has sent stocks of pharmaceutical middlemen south on more than one occasion. “Amazon has shown that they have mastery of the technology and innovative approaches to really transform how the marketplace delivers product,” said Linda Pissott Reig, who co-chairs the FDA section of the Pittsburgh-based law firm Buchanan, Ingersoll & Rooney PC. The move could also have wider implications for consumers. Amazon could use de-identified big data to then see if, for example, “a patient with depression is also seeking out self-help books, or particular products,” she said. “Amazon, with a giant marketplace, has a lot of ability to collect information.” Related: Amazon wants to disrupt the neighborhood pharmacy—but its sketchy health products could get in the way Why the prospect of Amazon’s entry to this new market is important: After transforming such industries as publishing, consumer electronics and cloud services — and decimating key players along the way — Amazon has built a reputation for dominance. But part of the wide interest in an Amazon pharmacy is that the highly regulated drug business has never been particularly transparent. At best, U.S. drug pricing is complex; at worst, it’s dysfunctional. Those who are skeptical of Amazon’s potential pharmacy entry have noted Amazon’s difficulty breaking into highly regulated markets, including alcohol distribution in the U.S. Industry leaders have brought up similar points. For one, CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.80% Chief Executive Larry Merlo told Wall Street analysts in August that his industry was “highly regulated, so the barriers to entry are high.” CNBC, which first reported on Amazon’s pharmacy plans in May, reported Friday that Amazon would make a decision before Thanksgiving. Given that time table, expect the question to crop up again this earnings season. Read more: Amazon’s Whole Foods deal pummels pharmaceutical stocks Amazon is buying Whole Foods: What you need to know What companies could be affected: Though Amazon’s involvement could presumably affect any and all parts of the pharmaceutical supply chain, including drug makers, it’s most threatening to retail pharmacy chains like Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, -3.14%  , CVS and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +1.37%  , according to Leerink Partners analyst Ana Gupte. That’s because Amazon is expected to begin getting cash-pay and mail-order customers, eventually moving into the pharmacy-benefits manager and retail pharmacy business, Gupte said. CVS, though, might be able to leverage its pharmacy-benefit manager unit to reduce its risk, said Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen. Anticipated competition from Amazon could also prompt pharmacies to diversify their offerings, Morgan Stanley analyst Ricky Goldwasser said this summer, including offering lab services like blood tests. Middlemen called pharmacy-benefit managers (PBMs), which work with drug makers to negotiate prices on behalf of health insurers and employers, are another player expected to be affected. They are not a well-known part of the U.S. pharmaceutical system but have come under scrutiny in the last year amid public outrage over drug costs. Because PBMs negotiate discounts from drugs’ total cost, critics charge that they also push prices higher to make their discounts appear more favorable. Leerink Partners Amazon poses “both an opportunity and a threat” for Express Scripts Holding Company, the largest stand-alone PBM, Gupte said. Express Scripts announced on Tuesday that it will buy privately-held medical benefit management company eviCore healthcare for $3.6 billion, a move that some saw as a response to the Amazon threat. Meanwhile, PBMs that are part of UnitedHealth Group UNH, -2.06% and Humana Inc. HUM, +0.48% will be more shielded, Gupte said. Drug distributors such as McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  , AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% and Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94% will likely have less exposure in the near term, according to Leerink’s Larsen. See: Amazon is pressuring drug stocks without lifting a finger and Amazon could push more pharmacies into offering lab tests Reasons for skepticism: A recent report that Amazon had obtained approval to become a wholesale distributors in several states sent pharmaceutical supply chain stocks down again in late October. But scrutiny of those approvals by the investment firm Jefferies found something important: Correspondence between two state pharmacy boards and Amazon showed that those state licenses could only be used for medical device and supplies distribution. That doesn’t rule out a pharmaceutical entry, but it does suggest that Amazon is starting with other, potentially easier medical products. Read: Amazon homing in on medical devices/supplies, not pharma: Jefferies Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes is another skeptic. Before acquiring Whole Foods this year, Amazon had talked about entering the grocery industry for more than a decade, Hynes noted. By contrast, Amazon hasn’t mentioned pharmacy on its earnings call in the past decade, Hynes said. In addition, even after CNBC reported on the online retailer’s purported plan, the company did not list any pharmacy-related jobs, Hynes said. And, if the company did decide to move into pharmacy, “there is no obvious asset to buy,” Hynes said. Read: Amazon’s getting into the pharmacy business is a ‘matter of when, not if’ | Also: Is Amazon serious about getting into pharmacy? This analyst isn’t so sure Amazon would need to either build or buy pharmacy capabilities, Gupte said, and could target a smaller player like specialty pharmacy Avella or acquire a larger entity. Many companies might also want to partner with Amazon, Leerink’s Gupte said, including the Blue Cross Blue Shield PBM unit Prime Therapeutics, “to enhance its drug discounts and mail penetration.” So might Express Scripts and Walgreens, Larsen said. Walgreens shares fell 3.4% in Oct. 9 trade after the CNBC report, CVS shares declined 3.5%, Wal-Mart shares rose 2.7% and shares of Express Scripts plummeted 4.9%.

ABC,"Have you ever heard a CEO drone on during a conference call with analysts? There’s jargon, there’s mangled English and there’s double-speak. It turns out that executives’ comments and behavior during those calls can be linked to subsequent stock performance. That was the finding of a study by S&P Global Market Intelligence Quantamental Research on what’s called natural language processing (NLP). As an example, here’s Stephen J. Luczo, Seagate Technology PLC’s STX, +2.87% former chairman and CEO (and now executive chairman) on a quarterly earnings call April 26: “I think from our perspective, we’ve always viewed this business as attractive in terms of its core business of selling into OEMs as well as servicing cloud service providers at one level, but really the opportunity to, I think, as architectures evolve and different customer needs evolve, to have the capability to optimize the devices either at the device level, at the subsystem level or the systems level, and if you do not have the software capability to do that, you really cannot take advantage of what we think would be a potentially significant long-term trend.” And here’s how the stock performed between April 25 and Oct. 9: FactSet His abuse of the English language was not enough, by itself, to signal problems with Seagate’s business (sliding sales) or the company’s shares. The research was led by David Pope, managing director of Quantamental Research, and Frank Zhao, its director. Here’s a link to the full research report. The scope of the work encompassed S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  companies’ earnings calls during four calendar quarters, through the second quarter of 2017. It tracked the tone of language, for example highlighting “troubling words,” such as “litigation” and “adjusted.” Also see: This company is parsing earnings calls to identify the speech patterns that move stock prices The researchers scored the complexity of the language used by executives. They went further, using the recorded transcripts to track executives’ pauses, repetition of words and other factors to incorporate the “tone” of the call into their statistical analysis. “Academic research shows when management is trying to hide bad news, they use language that is not easily understood. In so doing, they eat up time, so there is less time for the Q&A with the analysts on the call,” Pope said in an interview Oct. 9. “Only 20% of communication is verbal,” he said, highlighting the importance of the analysis of earnings call “metadata” for pauses and other indicators.

ABC,"Whether online retailer Amazon plans to enter the pharmacy-services space has been the subject of speculation for months, and Leerink analyst David Larsen is now going public with his position on the will-it-or-won’t-it question. “It’s a matter of when, not if,” Larsen said, adding that he expects an announcement in the next year or two. “While AMZN AMZN, +1.11% is likely still researching what its ultimate strategy should look like, with [approximately 75 million] Amazon Prime lives, seemingly unlimited resources, and highly advanced technology capabilities, we believe [Amazon] can create disruption to the existing market.” As such, Larsen said he’s more cautious about pharmacy-benefit managers and retail pharmacies, both major players in the pharmaceutical supply chain. Pharmacy retailers such as Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA, -3.14% and RiteAid Corp. RAD, +0.60% face the biggest threat for now, he said, while companies like CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.80% may be able to leverage pharmacy-benefit-manager services to reduce risk. CNBC reported later Friday that an Amazon entry is “very much an ‘if’ and not a ‘when,’” adding that the company will decide by Thanksgiving whether to move into the industry. Don’t miss: Every time this happens, Amazon crushes another legacy retailer Express Scripts Holding Co. ESRX, -0.93%  , the largest stand-alone pharmacy-benefit manager, may be willing to partner with Amazon since it “has been facing deteriorating mail volumes for years and [Amazon’s] technology in our view could be the strategy needed to improve performance,” Larsen said. So might Walgreens, he said, through some kind of retail partnership. Drug distributors like McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  , AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% and Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94% are likely to have less exposure in the near term, according to Larsen. See: Amazon’s Whole Foods deal pummels pharmaceutical stocks The easiest initial target for Amazon would likely be generic medications, which are lower-cost than so-called specialty medications and make up a majority of prescriptions, Larsen said. An estimated 5% to 10% of U.S. individuals pay cash for their prescriptions, he said, and Amazon could potentially offer a drug discount program to those customers. There also might be an avenue into specialty pharmacy through an acquisition, Larsen said, based on conversations with specialists from consulting services firm MEDACorp. Amazon’s acquisition of Whole Foods in June sparked investor concerns that the store’s physical presence would provide Amazon an opening into the pharmacy category. Read more: Amazon is pressuring drug stocks without lifting a finger And: Is Amazon serious about getting into pharmacy? This analyst isn’t so sure But Larsen’s analysis suggested that Amazon’s mail capacity and online services constitute a greater advantage, though he did note that the company could open pharmacies inside Whole Foods stores. “We’re surprised to learn that it would take just [one or two] years to build a [pharmacy-benefits manager],” Larsen said. “There is significant mail capacity and there are claims platforms available that [Amazon] could use.” Further, “we do not believe that Amazon has to win a massive amount of [market] share to keep pressure on the pharmacy supply chain,” Larsen said, “rather ongoing reimbursement competition and discussions on drug pricing may be enough to keep pressure on the group.” Related: Amazon could push more pharmacies into offering lab tests Not all of Wall Street is sold, though. Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes has long maintained she doesn’t see any sign that Amazon has plans to get into pharmacy services. The company doesn’t appear to have posted any pharmacy-related jobs, and it hasn’t mentioned the industry on any of its earnings calls over the last decade, according to Hynes.

ABC,"Given the precarious health of the global economy, owning quality stocks is paramount. Among my favorite high-quality companies right now is pharmaceutical powerhouse McKesson. McKesson MCK, +0.15%  is one of the top three drug distributors in the U.S. McKesson, Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94%  , and AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29% collectively control more than 90% of the pharmaceuticals distribution market. The fact that all three companies are of similar size is critical to the stability of their industry — and accordingly to McKesson’s long-term earnings growth. That’s because when an industry is dominated by a few companies of different sizes, a smaller player may feel it is at a competitive disadvantage and launch a price war (forgoing short-term profitability) to gain additional market share — and thus undermine a predictable pricing structure. The wireless sector in the U.S. is a great example of this. There are four major players, but AT&T T, +0.25%   and Verizon Communications VZ, -0.37%   are double the size of T-Mobile TMUS, +0.28%  and Sprint S, +0.41%  . After Sprint’s overture to buy T-Mobile was blocked by regulators, T-Mobile initiated a price war that, combined with its creative marketing, allowed it to steal customers from both Verizon and AT&T — a win for consumers, but it flatlined AT&T and Verizon earnings. Back to drug distributors. Since all the players are approximately the same size, a price war is unlikely — though there may be healthy short-term flare-ups of competition. Read more: Amazon is pressuring drug stocks without lifting a finger My firm has owned both Cardinal Health and McKesson (more than once) in the past and knows these businesses well. Think of these companies as railroads for prescription- and generic drugs in the U.S. Pfizer, PFE, +0.54%   for instance, doesn’t want to deal with hundreds of pharmacies, nor does it have the scale to do so. Instead, Pfizer pays McKesson a small fee to distribute its drugs to pharmacies and hospitals. TimeMcKesson Corp.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:MCK $140 $150 $160 $170 The drug distribution industry was affected by a deceleration of price inflation for pharmaceuticals during the second half of 2016 — it was election season, and pharma companies did not want to give politicians any extra ammunition. (Mylan MYL, +1.65%  and a few others had done plenty of that already.) You may hate this as an consumer, but price inflation for pharmaceuticals is a fact of life. We are less likely to see EpiPen-like increases going forward, but on its most recent earnings call McKesson projected mid- to high-single-digit price inflation for branded drugs. How to invest in the future of health care Here’s how we view McKesson: an oligopoly-like business with a high return on capital, a terrific balance sheet (it could pay off all of its debt in one year), and great cash flows. It is organically growing revenue 5% to 6% a year and returning cash to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends. Let’s focus on cash flows a bit more. McKesson generates about $3 billion a year of free-cash flows — cash earnings that are left after a company has paid all of its ongoing expenses and invested in fixed assets (equipment, buildings, etc.) required to maintain its current earnings power. The beauty of McKesson’s business is that it doesn’t consume a lot of capital, so incremental growth doesn’t cost much. The company can grow revenue and net income 5% to 6% a year without much incremental investment. McKesson’s management has several options for what it can do with $3 billion of free-cash flows. It can increase the dividend (McKesson pays a small dividend of 0.8% that it has promised to raise over time); it can buy back stock if it is cheap (McKesson has done some of that); it can pay down debt (the company has little debt, so paying that down is not a high priority); or, finally, it can make acquisitions that will add to McKesson’s growth. (McKesson has made acquisitions from time to time.) If McKesson management spends its cash wisely on dividends, buying back stock, or making acquisitions, then 5% to 6% organic growth will accelerate to the mid-teens. If McKesson management spends its cash wisely on dividends, buying back stock, or making acquisitions, then 5% to 6% organic growth will accelerate to the mid-teens. McKesson is a growing, high-quality business, and we paid only about 10 times earnings, or less than half of what the stock market is paying for the privilege of owning Coca-Cola KO, +0.25%   I would like to zoom in deeper on what may appear to be a small analytic shift that we’ve been making at my firm, though it’s one we believe is highly significant: We have become dogmatic about quality. It is now an uncompromising filter in our analysis. If a company doesn’t pass our quality filter, we stop — we don’t bother with the valuation and growth dimensions. Passing the quality test doesn’t mean a company is a buy, but it earns a stock the right to be examined for valuation and growth.

ABC,"New Mexico sued several major pharmaceutical companies and wholesale drug distributors on Thursday, arguing the corporations are partly to blame for rampant opioid addiction rates in the state. The lawsuit, filed in state court in Santa Fe County, follows the lead of half a dozen other states that have also sued over the opioid crisis. All claim pharmaceutical companies played down the addictive risk of the painkillers in their marketing to the public and doctors, causing them to be widely prescribed for chronic pain and fueling addiction. Most of the other states to sue, including New Hampshire, South Carolina, Ohio and Oklahoma, have focused their claims solely on the pharmaceutical companies. Dozens of cities and counties, meanwhile, have filed litigation against distributors, claiming they unlawfully sold painkillers into the regions and failed to monitor and report suspicious orders. New Mexico is going after both camps. Thursday’s suit names drugmakers Purdue Pharma L.P., Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

ABC,"Months ago, a report that Amazon has plans to enter the pharmacy business struck fear into investors’ hearts. The company’s Whole Foods acquisition sent the stocks of many in the pharmaceutical supply chain plummeting. But in the time since, “we do not see any signals that suggest AMZN AMZN, +1.11% is building up capabilities internally to enter the pharmacy market,” said Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes, who reiterated buy ratings for CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.80%  and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -3.14% and a neutral rating for Rite Aid Corp. RAD, +0.60%  . “We are simply not convinced that Amazon is a real competitive risk for pharmacy.” Shares of pharmaceutical middlemen Walgreens, CVS, McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  , AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  and Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94% fell after Amazon’s mid-June Whole Foods acquisition on concerns that the online retail giant might pivot Whole Foods into a pharmaceutical distributor. While Amazon has yet to confirm whether it’s weighing an expansion into the pharmacy market, many on Wall Street believe the company needs some type of physical store presence to do so. See more: Amazon’s Whole Foods deal pummels pharmaceutical stocks And yet, Amazon has not listed any pharmacy-related job postings in the last 10 weeks, Hynes said, except for postings that appear related to Amazon’s existing businesses. There have also been “very few” new postings in that period of time, she said, which is notable given that “if Amazon is serious about entering the pharmacy market... any entrance would need to be organic (there is no obvious asset to buy) and any investment would be significant.” Read: Is Amazon serious about getting into pharmacy? This analyst isn’t so sure One July 17 posting for a position that would “own and operate the security and compliance elements of a new healthcare initiative” could be related to an Amazon initiative to sell basic medical products to health care providers, Hynes said, but it isn’t a very detailed post. Previous behavior by the company suggests that it would explore a new industry before a large acquisition, she said, “so do not consider entering the market through M&A as an imminent threat either.” Others on Wall Street are more enthusiastic about an Amazon pharmacy entry. Opinion Journal: How Regulators Helped Amazon Retail pharmacy is a $200 to $300 million market that Amazon could disrupt by “eliminating 70,000 retail locations and related staffing and other expenses, replaced by automated distribution centers with efficient pharmacist oversight,” said Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes in August. Another advantage Amazon could have is “an easy-to-use user interface, which we believe is an Amazon strength which leverages the existing Amazon capabilities.” The company could achieve this by partnering with large pharmacy-benefit managers or disrupting both the PBM and retail pharmacy business model, Wilkes said. Related: Amazon could push more pharmacies into offering lab tests A possible Amazon entry “is still an overhang on the retail sector,” Mizuho’s Hynes said, citing the performance of CVS and Walgreens shares since a mid-May CNBC report that Amazon was mulling a pharmacty entry. Amazon also hasn’t mentioned pharmacy on its earnings calls in the last decade, according to Hynes. Before it acquired Whole Foods, the company talked consistently about entering the grocery industry for more than a decade, she said. Amazon shares have declined 4% over the last three months, compared with a 1% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  . In the last three months, CVS shares have risen 2%, McKesson shares have plummeted 6%, AmerisourceBergen shares have plummeted 12%, Cardinal Health shares have dropped 7%, Walgreens shares have risen 0.4% and Rite Aid shares have plummeted 29%.

ABC,"Editor’s note: This has been updated to reflect Mylan’s earnings, published on Wednesday. Dividend-chasing is in vogue. Given low interest rates, many investors say they have no other choice. Such thinking leads to costly mistakes. It just badly hurt those who had bought shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA, +0.29%  because of its high dividend yield. This isn’t just an issue for Teva investors, of course. There are many companies whose share price is being held up by dividend chasers. Take what happened in this case, however, as a reminder to review your portfolio and then sell those dividend-paying stocks where underlying businesses are deteriorating. In the case of Teva, the warning signs were certainly there, but investors who were focused on the dividend missed them. Click here to see an annotated chart. The chart also shows the points when the “smart money” was selling into the strength generated by dividend chasers. On the surface, the dividend yield looked attractive. Not only did the company pay a good dividend, but it was passing other screens that many investors use. These include the longevity of the dividend, dividend growth and the payout ratio, which is the share of net income that is paid in dividends. The chart shows the point when the dividend yield reached 4.5%. But all wasn’t well at Teva, which is best known for its generic-drug business but also has a branded (or not generic) drugs unit. Prices on generic drugs have been under pressure, and its main branded drug, Copaxone, was facing patent challenges. While Teva’s business showed signs of improvement at the end of 2016, that quickly disappeared, and it became clearer that competitors would succeed in a long-running patent battle over Copaxone, a treatment for multiple sclerosis. Read: Teva shares fall as court invalidates patent infringement claims Anyone who looked forward could see the risk to the stock price and the dividend because profits could plunge. The stock price, however, generally remained in the $30s as dividends provided the support.

Send it to Nigam Arora. The most common question I am being asked now is why the stock is falling so much. Many investors are shocked that a large-cap blue-chip stock in a business like generic drugs can fall so much on the news. After all, generic drugs aren’t going out of fashion. Read: Weaker generic drug prices hit makers, wholesalers Here are three reasons that explain the magnitude of the fall. •The stock shouldn’t have stayed as high as it did prior to the fall based on fundamentals. The main reason the stock stayed so high was the dividend chasers. •In addition to its genetic business, Teva’s popular Copaxone drug has been a significant contributor to its bottom line. The drug is now coming under generic attack. •Under one scenario, Teva stock can fall to $10. This scenario involves stronger competition for Copaxone and continued deterioration in the generic drug business. Read: Teva’s stock has tumbled over 8 sessions and Morgan Stanley says it could fall 16% more Of course, there is nothing static in the stock market. Things can change on a dime. There is a scenario under which Teva stock can jump back to $30. It involves a new CEO liked by Wall Street, less-than-expected competition for Copaxone and a reversal in the decline of generic drug prices. Other stocks could be at risk Here are the key lessons that investors may want to learn from what happened with Teva: •First and foremost, pay attention to the underlying business. •Stop chasing dividends. •Take a close look at your screens. Your screens may be backward-looking. •Even if you add some readily available forward-looking data, you get no edge because everyone has the same data. Investors need to go beyond the screens and look at the trends in the underlying businesses. •Other stocks are at risk. Makers of generic drugs like Mylan MYL, +1.65% Perrigo PRGO, +0.90%  and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories RDY, -0.30%  also could see their share prices slump because prices of generic drugs keep falling. On Wednesday, Mylan shares skidded after the company cut its earnings guidance and projected sharp price declines for generic drugs. It also said it would delay its launch of a generic version of Copaxone. Also at risk are companies that act as middlemen such as AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29% McKesson MCK, +0.15% Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94% and Express Scripts ESRX, -0.93%   because middlemen generate large profits from generic drugs.

ABC,"U.S. generic-drug prices are falling at the fastest rate in years, eating into the profits of pharmaceutical wholesalers and manufacturers alike and erasing billions of dollars of their market value in recent days. The three largest U.S. drug wholesalers, which warehouse and distribute some $400 billion of pharmaceuticals annually, have been competing aggressively to win business among independently owned pharmacies, largely by agreeing to cut prices on generics. In turn, the wholesalers are squeezing drugmakers for better prices. The trend has been good for the employers and government programs that ultimately pay for drugs, and for independently owned pharmacies, the mom-and-pop operators that compete with national chains. But it is taking a hard toll on wholesalers and generic-drug makers. Shares of Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., the world's largest seller of generic drugs, fell 24% on Thursday in New York Trading after the company's quarterly revenue and profit fell short of analysts' forecasts, driven by a 6% decline in generic product prices from the same period last year. The Israeli company said the pricing pressure on generics won't ease soon, and expects deflation to accelerate in the second half of the year. Teva's stock dropped an additional 13% Friday. Through the close of regular trading on Friday, shares of some of the largest generics companies, including Mylan N.V., Perrigo Co. PLC, and Endo International PLC had declined 10% or greater since Monday. The firms are scheduled to report earnings next week. AmerisourceBergen Corp., the second-largest U.S. wholesaler, said Thursday it continued to expect generic prices to decline by a range of 7% to 9% annually in its current fiscal year. The trend contributed to a 8.7% decline in operating profit in its pharmaceutical distribution unit, and sent shares down 10.5%. The company's largest competitors, Cardinal Health Inc. and McKesson Corp., also recently reported persistent generic pricing pressure as a factor behind their declining profits. ""There's no doubt that when you have a key product category with a 9% deflation rate, that's a headwind you're getting,"" AmeriSource CEO Steve Collis said in an interview. ""Some of the benefits we've been getting from buy-side generic contracts have been eliminated or cut back -- that's why you've seen our growth rates moderate."" Wholesalers, which make money in part by selling generic and brand-name drugs to pharmacies at a markup, have also recorded moderating profits on some branded drugs. That is because some pharmaceutical companies are raising branded prices at a slower rate than in previous years to avoid sparking further scrutiny from lawmakers in Washington, where concern about rising drug costs runs high. Generic drugs are cheap copies of medicines that have lost patent protection. Prices tend to fall dramatically when a drug loses patent protection and multiple companies begin producing it. But in recent years, prices for many generics increased -- sometimes dramatically -- because of market disruptions that decreased competition. Some manufacturers stopped making certain drugs because of manufacturing and quality-control problems, and the Food and Drug Administration fell behind on approving new market entrants. In some cases, according to allegations by state and federal prosecutors, some generics companies and executives conspired to fix prices of certain generics. Now, the trend has reversed, and prices are falling faster than their historical averages, according to an analysis by Raymond James & Associates Inc. ""There was this egregious pricing, and it was a windfall"" for some generic drugmakers and wholesalers, said John Ransom, a Raymond James analyst. ""These guys were over-earning with the pharma pricing bubble,"" he says. Cardinal Health CEO George S. Barrett said a handful of drugs were responsible for driving overall generic inflation higher in previous years, but that the sudden downturn caught some companies by surprise. ""We've returned to more normal patterns -- [but] the shift was rather rapid, which was jarring to the system,"" Mr. Barrett said in an interview. At McKesson, generic price deflation contributed to a 43% decline in profit in the most recently completed quarter. ""There are more approvals in some of these [generic] categories and more supply has led to more competition,"" pressing down prices, CEO John H. Hammergren said in an interview. The company, whose shares have dropped 20% over the past 12 months, is taking steps to reduce its exposure to pricing slowdowns on brand-name drugs, he said. The generic pricing downturn began in 2016, when AmeriSource, based in Chesterbrook, Pa., ignited a price war among wholesalers to win business from independently owned pharmacies. Such small pharmacies are among the most profitable customers for wholesalers because they have traditionally had less purchasing power than national chains. Independently owned pharmacies typically purchase drugs through group-purchasing organizations, or GPOs. Early last year, AmeriSource gave generous pricing terms on a nine-year contract with a group-purchaser representing more than 1,000 pharmacies. As word spread in the industry of AmeriSource's new contracting terms, other GPOs began seeking better pricing from their own wholesalers, said Donald Anderson, CEO of Independent Pharmacy Cooperative, a GPO that has about 2,800 primary pharmacy members and renegotiated its contract with McKesson earlier this year. Wholesalers were also compelled to cut prices because pharmacies were increasingly seeking lower generics prices from suppliers other than their primary wholesaler, he said. IPC, for instance, increasingly purchases generics directly from manufacturers and sells them to pharmacies from its own warehouses. The cooperative sold $1.3 billion in medicines last year, up from about $500 million eight years earlier, Mr. Anderson said. ""The three wholesalers probably had gotten to a point that their pricing was not competitive in the marketplace,"" Mr. Anderson said. Now, ""they've become much more aggressive"" on pricing, he says. Wholesalers are using their own purchasing alliances to squeeze drug manufacturers for better prices. AmeriSource purchases generics through a partnership with retail pharmacy giant Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc., which was recently joined by Express Scripts Holding Co., a pharmacy-benefits manager. Cardinal Health is allied with CVS Health Corp., and McKesson has joined forces with Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The three purchasing groups combined will represent 80% of all generic purchases in the U.S. this year, according to estimates by Adam Fein of Pembroke Consulting Inc., which tracks drug distribution. Teva on Thursday pointed to the consolidation of its customer base into purchasing groups as a key factor driving its disappointing quarterly performance. The groups have accelerated the frequency and scope of new contracting proposals in the past six to nine months, Dipankar Bhattacharjee, president of Teva's generic medicines group, said on a conference call with analysts. In July, Novartis AG said generics prices fell 8% in the second quarter, driving a 15% sales decline in its U.S. generics business. ""The whole sector in generics is feeling pricing pressure in the U.S.,"" Richard Francis, who heads Novartis's generics business, told analysts on the company's July earnings conference call.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% added 9.86 points, or less than 0.1%, at 22,026.10, supported by gains in Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.54% but pressured by a decline in Goldman Sachs Group Inc., down 1%, and similar drop in Apple Inc.

It is on its longest winning streak, at eight sessions, since the 12-session period ended Feb. 27. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.38% declined 5.41 points, or 0.2%, to 2,472.16, weighed by 1.3% tumble in the energy sector, headlined by a 8.7% decline in Concho Resources Inc.

Selling in energy stocks coincided with a retrenchment in crude-oil futures, with West Texas Intermediate futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange US:CLU7  settling off 1.1% lower at $49.03 a barrel. Meanwhile, the technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64% gave up 22.30 points, or 0.4%, at 6,340.34. “Energy is primarily the only thing that [kept] the S&P from being in positive territory,” said Michael Antonelli, equity sales trader at Robert W. Baird & Co. Antonelli said investors are also taking a step back from recent gains. “Investors are leaning a little bit more cautiously simply for the very, very near term because of bullish sentiment being higher than normal,” he said. Antonelli also said the tendency of August to be a weak month for returns is giving investors reason to hold back from buying stocks. On the economic front, a closely watched service-sector report from the Institute for Supply Management indicated that nonmanufacturing activity, also known as services, fell to 53.9% in July from 57.4% in June. Economists polled by MarketWatch expected a reading of 56.9%. Any reading above 50% indicates improving conditions. Services’ slowing pace comes after an early reading of employment didn’t stoke much of a market reaction, showing weekly jobless claims holding at a 44-year low, underlining the health of the labor market. Initial jobless claims from July 23 to July 29 declined by 5,000 to 240,000, while the average of new claims over the past month fell to 241,750. Randy Frederick, managing director of trading and derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research, said Thursday’s pullback for stocks wasn’t atypical of a market that has hit repeat records in the past year, fueled in part by hope for better corporate results and a pro-business atmosphere fostered by President Donald Trump’s administration. “Every time we see a major index hit a milestone…you see a little sideways action or a pullback. It’s not at all uncommon,” Frederick said. Worries that equities are rising too quickly have stoked some fears that a severe, near-term downdraft is imminent, but the Schwab analyst said the case for bullishness is still prevailing.

ABC,"Amid America’s national, intensifying opioid crisis, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters have a message for pharmaceutical middleman McKesson Corp. : you are part of the problem — and things have got to change. Among the corporate changes the labor union is calling for are independent board chairs, executive pay reforms and a special investigative committee to investigate the company’s role in the opioid crisis. The Teamsters plan to present their proposal at McKesson’s MCK, +0.15%  annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, and to protest outside the meeting. The union has a sizeable stake in this fight: about $30 million in pension and benefit funds invested in McKesson, the U.S.’s largest drug distributor and fifth-largest company, with nearly $200 billion in revenue for fiscal 2017. They also say the issue is personal. Much of its membership has been affected by the opioid crisis, which became clear at its Las Vegas convention last year. Teamster Secretary-Treasurer Ken Hall is also from West Virginia, which has the country’s highest opioid overdose rate. Read: Opioids are ravaging the U.S., but they’re still the best pain drug we’ve got On Monday, the Teamsters got support from officials in West Virginia, Illinois and Pennsylvania, three of the hardest-hit states. Writing to McKesson’s Lead Independent Director Edward Mueller, the state treasurers supported the Teamsters’ request for an independent chairman, asked for executive pay changes and requested reports on the company’s financial risk related to prescription opioid distribution and on America’s prescription opioid problem more generally. “While the opioid epidemic has been brutal for millions of Americans, it has been very good to wholesalers of these drugs. McKesson is now the fifth-largest corporation in America,” said the letter, which was written by State Treasurer of West Virginia John Perdue, State Treasurer of Illinois Michael Frerichs and State Treasurer of Pennsylvania Joseph Torsella. “We believe the extent of the problem; McKesson’s inadequate response to date; and McKesson’s potential exposure to substantial litigation costs, damages awards, and a significantly less lenient regulatory environment require McKesson to also take these specific steps to mitigate public health risks and protect shareholder value,” the letter said. McKesson spokesperson Kristin Hunter Chasen said that the company has made investments and enhancements to its controlled substances monitoring program, and has also appointed an independent review committee to examine its distribution of controlled substances. She also said that the Teamsters are in a labor contract dispute with one of McKesson’s facilities, a fact that can’t be “disentangled” from their corporate proposal. “We take our responsibility to help manage the safety and integrity of the pharmaceutical supply chain extremely seriously and are committed to maintaining — and continuously improving — strong programs designed to detect and prevent opioid diversion,” Chasen said. Related: America’s opioid epidemic is everywhere — but it’s especially bad in these 5 states CDC The mortality rate from opioid overdose more than tripled from 2000 to 2015. Although the opioid crisis has cost American workers and the economy, “senior employees at the three largest drug wholesalers have fared a little better at their jobs,” the letter said, noting that longtime McKesson Chief Executive John Hammergren was named Forbes’ best-paid CEO in 2012, with $131.2 million in total compensation. The state treasurers also requested a meeting with the company’s senior management. See: What does America’s opioid crisis mean for unemployment?

The union has sent letters to and attended the shareholder meetings of both, according to Michael Pryce-Jones, the Teamsters’ senior corporate governance analyst. American Epidemic: The Nation’s Struggle With Opioid Addiction The Teamsters aren’t the only ones placing blame on this part of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Attorneys in West Virginia sued the three companies earlier this year on behalf of certain areas affected by the opioid epidemic.

The Cherokee Nation is suing the three drug distributors along with pharmacies, arguing that those companies haven’t fulfilled their legal obligations when it comes to controlled substances. See: Opioid addiction diagnoses rose nearly 500% in the last seven years But why target drug distributors and not drugmakers? “There’s an awful lot of blame to go around,” Pryce-Jones said. Distributors’ main job is to safely distribute drugs, he said: “The failings they were being accused of were vital to their core mission.” And, because three drug distributors dominate the market, “as shareholders, you are uniquely exposed to legal and financial risks from any lawsuits or policy action,” Pryce-Jones said.

ABC,"On June 13, as members of a Senate health panel gathered to discuss the rising cost of prescription drugs, the prices of 14 common medications were increased by some 20% to 85%. The affected drugs would appear to be unlikely candidates for price hikes. All were generic drugs, which lack patent protection and therefore tend to be much less expensive, with prices, in fact, largely declining over time. One drug, which saw an 85% increase in its price, is used to treat tuberculosis. An anti-seizure drug’s price rose 63%. A drug for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder was increased by 47%. An unlikely entity’s name appears on the medications’ labels: AmerisourceBergen Corp.’s ABC, +1.29% American Health Packaging unit. That most consumers don’t know about and will never interact with a company like AmerisourceBergen, one of the largest U.S. drug distributors, speaks to the complexity of the sprawling U.S. pharmaceutical system, which enlists pharmaceutical middlemen to negotiate prices and distribute drugs. The blame for rising drug prices once fell squarely on drug makers. But it has shifted at least in part to industry middlemen, with critics saying those companies benefit from high prices and help drive them up. In turn, the middlemen point back to drugmakers, charging that they set the prices in the first place. The corporate blame game can make it hard to determine who is actually benefiting from higher drug prices. June 13’s price increases are a case in point as to why this has become a harder question to answer than it might at first seem. “People don’t really understand the big picture,” said Michael Rea, founder and chief executive officer of Rx Savings Solutions, a software company that works with employers and health plans so that patients can comparison shop. “There’s blame to go around for most of the players in the supply chain.” Related: Express Scripts is airing dirty laundry in its nasty, very public Anthem divorce Plus: Is Amazon serious about getting into pharmacy? This analyst isn’t so sure When it comes to drug pricing, AmerisourceBergen is best known as a bellwether for industry trends. The company and competitors including McKesson and Cardinal Health make money based on drug sales and can thus predict how much prices will rise or fall in a given year. And, if they negotiate prices with a pharmacy, they can also play a role in setting prices. The company and competitors including McKesson MCK, +0.15% and Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94% make money based on drug sales. If they negotiate prices with a pharmacy, they can also play a role in setting prices. Because rising and falling prices affects these companies’ bottom lines, they often — and not always successfully — issue predictions for drug-price trends. AmerisourceBergen’s Columbus, Ohio–based American Health Packaging buys drugs in bulk and repackages them for use in places like hospitals, including the 14 drugs in question. The idea is that patients in a hospital, who could be discharged at any time, are provided a daily dose of a drug. It’s convenient for a hospital to buy drugs packaged that way, in unit doses, like an individually packaged cookie, handy to grab quickly, as compared with, say, a box of 100. See: Drug stocks sink as backlash against price hikes hits bottom lines American Health Packaging doesn’t make the drugs or set their bulk price. But it does set the price for those unit doses, presumably with a markup. AmerisourceBergen, when contacted by MarketWatch about the price increases, responded that such questions should be asked instead of the drug manufacturer. A spokeswoman, though, declined to identify the manufacturer or manufacturers. The cost of the bulk drugs “does impact the price we’re able to offer our consumers,” the spokeswoman said. “There are natural checks and balances within the marketplace to ensure we’re competitively priced, and, should a hospital choose to, the health-system pharmacy can purchase products from a manufacturer in bulk and package those medications in-house.” Muscular Dystrophy Drug to Cost $89,000, and More Why does all this matter? Drugs for a wide range of diseases and symptoms were affected by the price hikes, including a urinary-tract-infection antibiotic (which saw its price upped by 37%); a muscle-weakness drug (22%); a medication for slowing down or ending bleeding (19%); and a drug that prevents stomach ulcers, induces labor and helps perform early abortions (up 30% at a lower dose and 38% at a higher one), according to data from Truven Health Analytics.

The price of American Health Packaging’s 10-milligram extended-release oral tablet of the diabetes medication glipizide hasn’t gone up since March 2011, according to the Truven data. On June 13, the price went up about 24%, while other formulations of the drug went up 37% and 40%. The Truven data refer to the drugs’ wholesale acquisition cost (WAC), or the price a drug maker — in this case, the re-packager, American Health Packaging — offers wholesalers. Discounts are typically taken from a drug’s WAC, so the metric may not represent its actual price (which isn’t public information). The increases could be a negotiating tactic, Rx Savings Solutions’ Rea said. They would “show that discounts got deeper, but really there’s been no price change,” he said. “There’s no reason to hike prices if it didn’t actually affect anything.” There are other, previous examples of generic-drug price hikes. Between 2010 and 2015, more than 300 generic drugs had at least one “extraordinary” price increase of 100% or more, according to a Government Accountability Office report last year. Yet when questioned about these increases, executives from drug manufacturers — including Mylan MYL, +1.65% Chief Executive Heather Bresch — have pointed instead to pharmaceutical middlemen, which benefit from higher prices, too. But the role of these industry players, including pharmacy-benefit managers (PBMs) — which negotiate drug prices on behalf of employers and health insurers — may be shifting out of the regulatory limelight. At the June 13 Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee meeting, “PBMs and distributors did not appear to be the targets,” said Citigroup analyst Garen Sarafian. And, more generally, pressure on drug prices may be letting up. Though President Donald Trump has repeatedly said he’d bring down prices, a draft executive order on the issue seems to benefit the industry, the New York Times reported Tuesday.

ABC,"Amazon’s Whole Foods deal Friday morning wrecked pharmaceutical stocks to the tune of about $10 billion in combined market cap. Amazon AMZN, +1.11%  has plans to enter the pharmaceutical industry, according to a mid-May CNBC report. The stocks of pharmaceutical middlemen took a hit Friday on speculation that Whole Foods US:WFM  could help Amazon disrupt the space. But how much of a sure thing is an entry by Amazon? Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes said Monday that she’s “still not convinced.” Stock reaction on Friday was overdone, she said, recommending buying the stocks of pharmaceutical middlemen on weakness. Amazom told MarketWatch that it has “a practice of declining to comment on rumors and speculation.” See more: Amazon’s Whole Foods deal pummels pharmaceutical stocks Looking back on about a decade of Amazon earnings calls, Hynes found that the company talked consistently about entering the grocery industry for more than a decade and conducted pilot programs in it. “It is important to note, recent investor fears of AMZN entering the pharmacy market are driven by unsubstantiated and unconfirmed press reports that AMZN is deciding whether or not the company should enter the pharmacy market, not by AMZN itself,” Hynes said. But, after examining the company’s earnings calls since 2006, “we did not find any mention of pharmacy in that time frame,” she said. Read: 20 years after IPO: How Amazon came to dominate books, electronics and the cloud According to the CNBC report, Amazon hired Mark Lyons, formerly of health plan Premera Blue Cross, to create “an internal pharmacy-benefits manager for Amazon employees, which might be later scaled out.” Lyons has a background as a pharmacist and pharmacy consultant, according to his LinkedIn, and has served as Amazon’s senior manager, pharmacy benefits for three months. But after speaking with industry contacts, Mizuho’s Hynes said that this role may be more focused on Amazon’s corporate health benefits. “We believe the reports in May that AMZN is hiring people to break into the pharmacy industry are mostly noise,” she said, adding that the company would be hiring more actively if it had plans in the space. See: 5 ways the Amazon–Whole Foods deal could change the way we shop Amazon is buying Whole Foods: What you need to know The U.S. has an incredibly complex and highly regulated pharmaceutical drug system. But Amazon has previously had trouble breaking into highly regulated markets, Hynes said. For example, the company hasn’t had much success in China, and has a limited presence in alcohol distribution in the U.S., she said. Amazon would also likely need to acquire in the sector to be successful in it, Hynes said, but “there are no obvious candidates that provide national scale.” Related: Did you buy a tech ETF to cash in on Amazon? Here’s some bad news Pharmacy chains like CVS Health Corp. CVS, -0.80% or Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. WBA, -3.14% or a pharmacy-benefits manager like Express Scripts Holding Co. ESRX, -0.93% — all of which saw shares plummet on Friday — would be major deals, far outpacing the about $14 billion Whole Foods acquisition, Amazon’s biggest one to date. Pharmacy-benefit managers negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers and employers. Currently, a small number of players dominate the market. But Leerink Partners analyst David Larsen said Amazon could buy a smaller pharmacy-benefit manager business, such as MedImpact, Navitus or even the Envision business from RiteAid Corp. RAD, +0.60% if the Walgreens acquisition of RiteAid doesn’t go through. “If AMZN decides to acquire RAD or a midsize PBM, we believe that AMZN could become more of a threat to CVS and WBA,” Larsen said on Friday. “We do not believe that this initial transaction [is] a material threat, but the longer-term implications are material in our view.” See: Feds increase scrutiny of Walgreens-Rite Aid merger And although Whole Foods could give Amazon a physical retail presence, the grocery chain only has about 460 stores in 45 states, Larsen said. Adding pharmacies to those locations wouldn’t necessarily be enough to compete with CVS and WBA, he said, though a mail-order pharmacy business could help alleviate that. Another analyst, UBS’s Michael Cherny, also questioned on Friday whether acquiring Whole Foods would bolster an Amazon pharmacy entry. Whole Foods sells vitamins and other wellness products, but it doesn’t have expertise in pharmacy, Cherny said, suggesting that there’s no link between the Whole Foods deal and Amazon’s possible interest in pharmacy.

ABC,"Following news of Amazon’s $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Friday morning, pharmaceutical stocks have suffered almost half as much market-cap damage in the aggregate as their grocery rivals. Rivals like Wal-Mart Stores WMT, +1.37% Costco COST, +2.63% Target TGT, +0.36% Kroger KR, +1.35%  and more lost a combined $22.6 billion in market cap as of Friday afternoon. But the stocks of pharmaceutical middlemen also took a serious hit, amounting to about $10 billion, according to UBS. Amazon AMZN, +1.11%  doesn’t currently sell pharmaceutical drugs, although it has plans to, according to a CNBC report last month. The market is currently dominated by a small number of pharmacy-benefit managers, which negotiate drug prices on behalf of health insurers and employers, along with drug wholesalers and distributors.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% unveiled an improved outlook for the current fiscal year as it reported revenue climbed during its fiscal first quarter, with pharmaceutical distribution revenue rising 3.9%. For the current fiscal year, the company expects adjusted earnings on a per-share basis between $5.72 and $5.92, up from a previous range of $5.63 to $5.88. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters expect $5.75. The company backed its previous annual revenue growth estimates of 6.5% to 8% improvement over the $146.8 billion posted in the 2016 fiscal year. Generally, the company said it expects to remain under pressure from weaker generic pricing. In the latest quarter, pharmaceutical distribution revenue grew to $36.58 billion from $35.19 billion a year before while sales in its other businesses increased 5.4% to $1.66 billion. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, AmerisourceBergen reported a profit of $247.2 million, or $1.11 a share, down from $329.6 million, or $1.45 a share, a year earlier. Excluding certain items, adjusted per-share earnings rose to $1.36 from $1.27. Revenue increased 4% to $38.17 billion. While earnings easily beat Wall Street expectations, sales fell short.

ABC,"Getty Images Donald Trump has made it clear he wants some form of protectionism as a cornerstone of his economic policy. For better or worse, and whatever form this takes, it’s likely to help companies that generate most of their sales at home. Donald Trump’s critics like to claim he doesn’t stand for anything. But that’s just because they haven’t looked hard enough. In speeches, online campaign policy messages and even tweets, Trump has regularly detailed policy reforms especially for business and the economy. These include lower taxes, fiscal stimulus, incentives to bring earnings home and protectionist policies. Though he didn’t add any details in his inauguration speech — and that’s never the point of this ceremonial address — his “America first” theme underscored his intent to enact those policies. After all, those policies basically put U.S. companies and the U.S. economy first. Will he actually get all of this done? No one knows. But with so many friends in Congress, and a majority there, it would be a mistake to count him out. As we’ve seen, prognosticators who discount Trump have a way of ending up looking dumb. “We continue to believe Trump might be a double-edged sword.” Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn So as the new president starts his first week in the White House, this is a good time to take stock of companies that will benefit the most from key Trump business and economic policies, according to Wall Street analysts. Here’s a comprehensive roundup. Companies with sales in the good ol’ US of A Trump has made it clear he wants some form of protectionism as a cornerstone of his economic policy. For better or worse, and whatever form this takes, it’s likely to benefit companies that generate most of their sales at home. Those companies will also get a direct shot of assistance from fiscal stimulus. They’ll get a relative boost from any ongoing strength in the dollar, since this reduces reported earnings for companies that get much of their earnings overseas. Goldman Sachs singles out the following companies as potential Trump policy beneficiaries because they generate virtually all of their revenue in the U.S. Naturally, many of them are in retail, and consumer products and services. Candidates for a Trump bump here include: Lowe’s LOW, +2.18% Target TGT, +0.36% Dollar General DG, +0.66% CVS CVS, -0.80% Whole Foods Market US:WFM Amazon.com AMZN, +1.11% Walt Disney DIS, +1.93% Wal-Mart Stores WMT, +1.37% Altria MO, -0.21% Public Storage PSA, -0.86% and Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, +1.43% Many are in energy and banking, sectors that could also benefit from deregulation. Companies Goldman Sachs highlights in these groups include: Pioneer Natural Resources PXD, +2.54% Marathon Petroleum MPC, +1.80% Wells Fargo WFC, +1.81% U.S. Bancorp USB, +0.86% PNC Financial Services PNC, +1.20% and J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +1.82% Others are in business services and transport, including: Paychex PAYX, +1.63% CSRA CSRA, +0.00% Intuit INTU, +1.42% Norfolk Southern NSC, +1.35% and CSX CSX, +2.58% Eric Marshall, portfolio manager and head of research at Hodges Capital Management, thinks U.S.-based steel companies could benefit a lot under Trump. That’s because the new president is likely to take steps to block subsidized steel from China sold here below cost. “We are going to have greater scrutiny on steel tariffs and how much steel is imported,” says Marshall. U.S. steel companies will also benefit from a rebound in infrastructure spending and manufacturing. “A lot of them are at 60% capacity,” says Marshall. “We think it could get closer to 80% or 90%.” One of his favorites is Commercial Metals CMC, +2.76% Goldman Sachs suggests Nucor NUE, +2.98% in this space. Companies with low labor costs The labor markets are so tight at 4.7% unemployment, companies have to bid up wages to get or keep workers. This is why average hourly wages recently saw the biggest jump since 2009, at 2.9%. Now, Trump wants to apply fiscal stimulus in the form of personal and corporate tax cuts, and more spending on the military, veterans benefits and infrastructure. That’s an unorthodox policy at full employment, because it risks sparking so much inflation that the Federal Reserve might have to get overly aggressive in raising rates — which could spook markets. All of this remains to be seen as a risk. In the meantime, with labor costs clearly on the march and greater wage pressure ahead, thanks to Trump stimulus, it makes sense to favor companies that don’t spend a lot on labor, relative to revenue. A group of low-labor-cost companies suggested by Goldman Sachs late last year has vastly outperformed companies with high labor costs. Analysts at the investment bank expect this to continue in 2017, as wages continue to go up and the market prices in higher inflation. As an added plus, the low-labor-cost companies singled out by Goldman Sachs, below, have faster sales and earnings growth compared with high-labor-cost companies. Consumer-facing low-labor-cost companies favored as winners by Goldman Sachs include: Netflix NFLX, +3.35% D.R. Horton DHI, +1.29% Pulte PHM, +1.41% Molson Coors TAP, -0.11% Nike NKE, +1.53% Costco COST, +2.63% Host Hotels and Resorts HST, +0.38% and Apple AAPL, +0.78% In energy, finance and insurance, the bank has suggested Valero Energy VLO, +2.76% Exxon Mobil XOM, +2.47% AFLAC AFL, +0.48% XL XL, -0.16% and AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29% In health care and biotech: Gilead Sciences GILD, +0.82% Celgene CELG, +0.90% McKesson MCK, +0.15% and Express Scripts ESRX, -0.93% Others include: Expeditors EXPD, +2.73% Archer Daniels Midland ADM, +1.33% and Qualcomm QCOM, +1.30% Companies that pay high taxes After Ronald Reagan’s Tax Reform Act lowered taxes in October 1986, large-cap companies paying the highest tax rates beat the broad market for the next three years, points out Credit Suisse analyst Lori Calvasina. So now with Trump looking to lower the corporate tax rate, it makes sense to go with companies that pay high tax rates. Trump wants a 15% corporate tax rate. House Republican lawmakers propose a 20% rate. But even a reduction to 25% would boost S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38%  earnings by 8%, say analysts at Goldman Sachs. As an added plus, many of the high-tax-rate companies also generate most, or all, of their sales at home. That makes them less vulnerable to steps to penalize importers and bigger direct beneficiaries of fiscal stimulus. Stocks to consider because they pay the highest effective tax rates, according to Goldman Sachs, include: Goodyear Tire & Rubber GT, +0.83% Robert Half International RHI, +1.87% Gap GPS, +0.97% Under Armour UA, +1.13% Nordstrom JWN, +1.06% Alliance Data Systems ADS, -4.07% Whole Foods Market, CVS Health, Monster Beverage MNST, +1.72% Marathon Oil MRO, +5.29% ConocoPhillips COP, +0.95% Hess HES, +3.88% CME CME, +1.83% T. Rowe Price TROW, +2.06% Charles Schwab SCHW, +2.59% and Laboratory Corp. of America LH, +0.14% Companies that Credit Suisse favors because they would see the biggest earnings gain from a tax cut include: Pinnacle Foods PF, +0.58% General Mills GIS, +1.60% Conagra Brands CAG, +1.54% Dean Foods DF, -0.12% Zumiez ZUMZ, +0.00% Habit Restaurants HABT, +2.33% Zoe’s Kitchen ZOES, +0.77% Shake Shack SHAK, +1.98% Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG, +1.13% Atkore International Group ATKR, +0.92% WestRock WRK, +1.60% Bemis BMS, +1.75% and International Paper IP, +2.00% Earnings-repatriation companies Trump favors a one-off tax holiday to let U.S. companies repatriate funds from overseas at a 10% tax rate versus the current 35%. That could potentially bring back much of the $2.6 trillion held overseas. According to analysts at Jefferies, companies with the highest amount of cash abroad as a percentage of market value are: Alphabet GOOGL, +3.18% (at 8.8% of market value), Priceline US:PCLN   (16.1%), eBay EBAY, +0.32% (7.9%), Activision ATVI, +2.26% (6.8%), Electronic Arts EA, +1.60% (8%), Expedia EXPE, +3.85% (5.7%), TripAdvisor TRIP, +0.69% (8.2%), IAC/InterActive IAC, +1.47% (9.6%) and Rubicon Project RUBI, -0.55%  (7.5%). Defense-sector companies One of the ways Trump wants to make “America first” is to build up the military. So it seems like defense stocks would be a no-brainer. But be careful here. Trump is also a stickler for costs, and he’s already called out Lockheed Martin LMT, +0.78% and Boeing BA, +2.46% for what they charge the government. So it’s tough to know which companies might do well, and which ones might get hurt by Trump’s concerns about costs. For now, it’s probably better to stay away from this group, as a Trump play. “We continue to believe Trump might be a double-edged sword,” says Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn. It’s also tough to know at this point which defense programs and services will get priority, says Stifel analyst Joseph DeNardi. For now it’s probably best to simply monitor the group for trading opportunities. Lockheed fell hard on Dec. 23 when Trump tweeted negatively about F-35 program costs. But it then went on to post 4% gains in two weeks as it recovered from the Trump twitter storm. Infrastructure plays This group is another tough one. Yes, our nation’s infrastructure is crumbling. You see this all the time when you drive around. And Trump’s plan to boost infrastructure spending would no doubt help this space, especially materials companies like Vulcan Materials VMC, +2.58% Martin Marietta Materials MLM, +2.73% and Summit Materials SUM, +1.88% But infrastructure plays face three challenges. 1. The earliest the industry could see any measurable spending benefit from Trump policies would be 2018, said economists Kermit Baker of the American Institute of Architects and Ken Simonson at the Associated General Contractors of America at a lunch recently sponsored by Stifel analyst Robert McCarthy. But it’s more likely to arrive in 2019. That’s a long way off. 2. Trump’s immigration policies could aggravate the construction labor shortage. Immigrants make up 30% of construction labor. 3. The group has rallied a lot, despite those challenges. “Our concern is that something will break investor euphoria,” says Stifel analyst Noelle Dilts. Indeed, this is a risk for all “Trump plays” and the market in general. The S&P 500 has rallied 6.5% since Election Day, which means investors have priced in a lot of Trump success. If he stumbles at all in his legislative agenda, the market could reverse itself, especially because investor sentiment is so high. But as we saw during the campaign, Trump has a way of getting what he wants. So any reversal in the market, and especially the names above, on a Trump stumble will probably be a buying opportunity.

ABC,"U.S. stocks rebounded from a sharp morning selloff, but still closed lower Thursday, with the Nasdaq snapping a seven-day winning streak as investors paused before the start of earnings season and a lack of policy detail in President-elect Donald Trump’s first formal news conference a day ago. Equity markets have been trading mostly sideways as investors begin to question the run-up in stock prices following the election on Trump’s promises of fiscal stimulus. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64% which had been down by as many as 67 points earlier, finished down 16.16 points, or 0.3%, at 5,547.49, retreating from its record close set on Wednesday, and snapping a streak of seven sessions of gains. Biotech rebounded from earlier losses after Trump said drug companies were “getting away with murder” at his Wednesday news conference. On Thursday, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, +0.72% finished up 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% closed down 63.28 points, or 0.3%, at 19,891.00, after trading down by as many as 184 points earlier in the session. The declines were broad-based, with 22 of the 30 components trading lower. Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.93%  and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.82% which reports earnings Friday morning, led the losses. The S&P 500 index SPX, +1.38%  fell 4.88 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 2,270.44 with seven out of 11 main sectors trading lower. Financials and energy led the declines. Earlier, the index had been down by as many as 21 points. “The Trump rally has exhausted itself, and it’s natural to see a pullback after a strong advance,” said Joe Saluzzi, partner, co-head of Equity Trading at Themis Trading. “Investors are probably repositioning and getting ready to hear from companies as earnings season begins.” Saluzzi said investors completely shifted their focus to the prospects of fiscal stimulus, after being dependent on the Fed since the financial crisis. “For the past seven years it was all about the Federal Reserve and monetary policy. Investors could count on the Fed to come to the rescue any time stocks fell. Now, it seems like nobody is even paying attention to Fed officials when they speak,” said Saluzzi.

ABC,"Just because a stock is being pummeled doesn’t mean it’s a loser. Carter Worth, a technical analyst at Cornerstone Macro, a broker-dealer based in New York and Washington, D.C., calls some that have been hammered recently “so bad that they’re good” — not simply because they went down, but because the heavy selling came despite having strong businesses overall. Worth’s idea is not simply to find stocks that are selling cheaply. “It is important to note that a stock in an established one-to-two year downtrend or in an even longer downtrend is NOT a ‘so bad, it’s good’ circumstance. Such a stock is a stock that is dying, [and the company] is perhaps going out of business,” he warned in a report published Monday that lists 20 of his picks. Do you bet on a horse that always loses? or the champion horse that comes out of the gate and stumbles? Carter Worth, technical analyst at Cornerstone Macro In an interview, he gave examples of companies he thought investors shouldn’t consider, such as accessories maker Fossil Group Inc. FOSL, +2.09% A two-year stock chart illustrates Worth’s point: FactSet Fossil’s sales for its fiscal second quarter slumped 7% from a year earlier. At the same time in 2015, sales had fallen 4% from 2014 levels. Worth’s sports analogy summed it up: “Do you bet on a horse that always loses? Or the champion horse that comes out of the gate and stumbles?” Food for thought Before showing Worth’s list, it’s important to point out that Worth calls it “just a representative list.” It is not an exhaustive list of all stocks meeting any particular criteria. “For every stock singled out there could be others. But these seemed as a group to be a good place to start,” he said.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. unveiled a new $1 billion stock-buyback plan as it closed its fiscal year with a rise in quarterly revenue. Still, the company did temper its new-year growth expectations to slightly below consensus views, citing ""uncertainty around drug-pricing trends."" Big drug wholesalers have recently signaled that a price war has broken out in the industry, and analysts have said AmerisourceBergen in particular has been moving to grow its market share among independent pharmacies. For the coming fiscal year, the company expects, on an adjusted basis, revenue to climb 6.5% to 8%, with earnings in the first two quarters either down a few cents or flat compared with the previous year. It said it expects to remain under pressure from weaker generic pricing. In the latest quarter, pharmaceutical distribution revenue grew 5.9% to $36 billion, and revenue in its other businesses increased 4.9% to $1.63 billion.

Excluding certain items, adjusted per-share earnings rose to $1.30 from $1.16. Revenue increased 5.9% to $37.6 billion.

ABC,"Many drug stocks bounced Monday in the aftermath of last week’s drubbing, but Cardinal Health Inc.’s earnings report acted as a reminder that the sector’s pricing problems are likely to get worse before they get better. Cardinal Health’s stock CAH, +0.94% had shot up by 2.5% at midday, on volume that already exceeded the full-day average. The drug-distribution company reported first-fiscal-quarter earnings that beat expectations but cut its outlook for the year, as a big drop in generic-drug prices was expected to offset an increase in branded-drug prices. On Friday, the stock tumbled 9.8% to a two-year low, after fellow drug wholesaler McKesson Corp.’s warning that a “softer pricing environment” would eat into its bottom line. See: EpiPen’s role in the drug-pricing backlash. Graphic embed is no longer available.

Express Scripts Holding Co. shares ESRX, -0.93% tacked on 2.4%, after losing 6% the previous session. Meanwhile, some drug-maker stocks, like AbbVie Inc.’s ABBV, +0.40%  , didn’t bounce. That stock fell 2.3% toward a seven-month low, adding to Friday’s 6.3% slide, after a Credit Suisse downgrade on concerns over the longevity of its key drug Humira given the current challenging payer environment. Analyst Vamil Divan cut his rating to neutral, after being at outperform for at least the last three years, and trimmed his stock price target to $54 from $59. Divan wrote in a note to clients, that he believes Humira is likely to struggle with “increased scrutiny on U.S. drug pricing making it more challenging for Humira to maintain preferred formulary positions once biosimilar versions are available.” Graphic embed is no longer available. Amgen Inc. shares AMGN, +0.01%  shed 1.6%, after taking a 9.6% hit on Friday after the company’s outlook fueled concerns about how the new pricing environment will affect future sales of its blockbuster drug Enbrel. Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges wrote in a recent note to clients that it was “game over” for Enbrel’s pricing power. He estimated that Enbrel price increases accounted for more than 80% of Amgen’s recent income growth, and the backlash over price increases now strips the company of one of its last remaining defenses against competition.

ABC,"The backlash against steep pharmaceutical price hikes over the last year has notoriously taken down individual drug companies — Mylan, Valeant and Turing among them. Now, drug wholesaler McKesson Corp.’s nearly 24.2% stock decline on Friday, the company’s biggest single-day price decline ever, along with a pricing policy about-face for Amgen Inc. appear to reflect larger ramifications across the health care sector from those pricing scandals. The SPDR health care exchange-traded fund XLV, +0.76%  was down 2.0% and the Nasdaq Biotech Index NBI, +0.68%  down 1.5% in early-afternoon trade. Wall Street analysts and investors have long speculated about pricing strategy turning into a risk for pharmaceutical and biotech companies. But attempts to determine the riskiest companies by that measure have encountered a challenge: all pharmaceutical companies had been making big price increases. McKesson MCK, +0.15%  on Thursday offered a clear signal of change when it said a “softer pricing environment” in the U.S. hurt its second-quarter results, in which income dropped by more than half and caused the company to slash its 2016 profit outlook. As a middleman in the pharmaceutical system, McKesson is compensated based on drug revenue, and thus, benefits from drug price increases. “What we have seen this year to date are fewer products with price increases, and those price increases are at lower rates than both prior-year results and our expectations for the current” fiscal year, said CEO John Hammergren, according to the FactSet transcript. The company expects coming pricing trends for branded drugs to be “meaningfully” below those this fiscal year, based on second-quarter results, he said. Graphic embed is no longer available. Competitors AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  and Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94% also plummeted in early-afternoon trade, with 13.0% and 11.7% declines, respectively. See more: McKesson shares slide as outlook slashed Amgen’s AMGN, +0.01%  third quarter provided additional evidence that pricing pressure is here to stay. The company said Thursday that it plans to move growth for blockbuster Enbrel on higher sales rather than increases in price, sending its stock diving 10.9% in Friday early-afternoon trade. The plan marks a departure from Amgen’s previous strategy with the drug. MarketWatch reported in July that Enbrel price increases offset a decline in the drug’s market share, prompting analysts to question “liberal price increases” as a long-term strategy. Read: Amgen is the latest to raise drug prices despite public outcry Graphic embed is no longer available. The company has used Enbrel price increases to propel more than 80% of its operating income growth over the last six quarters, according to Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges, who deemed the move “devastating” and “game over” for Amgen. The change “unwinds one of the company’s last remaining defenses against revenue and earnings erosion from biosimilar and branded competitors,” Porges said. See: Mylan’s EpiPen caught the full force of drug price outrage because it was the perfect target, not because it was the only one Despite the spiraling controversy, and evidence that consumers support pricing regulation in one form or another, there’s been little movement on Capitol Hill. Pricing pressure has instead come from commercial entities, especially employers and drug-negotiating middlemen called pharmacy-benefit managers. Read: This health care player you’ve never heard of is acting ‘aggressively’ to keep costs down Pharmacy-benefit managers “stop the pricing music regardless of the government,” Porges said. And “there is no reason to expect the volume trends to increase in coming periods...absent net positive price, Enbrel’s trajectory, and profit contribution, will be inexorably negative.” McKesson shares dropped 38.4% year to date, compared with a 4.3% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% Amgen shares dropped 11.8% year-to-date.

ABC,"Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and Rite Aid Corp. said Thursday they had extended the deadline to complete their merger as the companies work to obtain regulatory approval. The move came as Walgreens posted an increase in profit in its fiscal fourth quarter as revenue edged higher. The companies now expect the deal to close in early 2017 after extending the merger agreements deadline from October 27 to January 27. Last October, Walgreens agreed to buy Rite Aid for about $9.4 billion. In September, Walgreens said it would divest more of its stores than previously expected to help satisfy the Federal Trade Commission's review. Walgreens said Thursday it remains actively engaged with the FTC and believes it will be able to divest between 500 and 1,000 stores, as required by the FTC, by the end of the year. The Deerfield, Ill., also said Thursday that overall sales at stores open at least a year fell 0.3% in the fourth quarter, due to lower sales of consumables and seasonal items, partially offset by sales in the health, wellness and beauty categories. During the quarter, Walgreens reported a profit of $1.03 billion, or 95 cents a share, up from $26 million, or 2 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding a swing in the value of warrants exercised to buy a stake in AmerisourceBergen Corp. and other items, per-share profit rose to $1.07 from 88 cents. Revenue edged up 0.4% higher to $28.64 billion. Analysts projected 99 cents in adjusted earnings per share on $29.06 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters. Walgreens said it expects $4.85 to $5.20 in adjusted earnings per share for its new fiscal year. Analysts expect $5.02, according to Thomson Reuters.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% raised its outlook for the current year as the drug wholesaler reported better-than-expected results for the three months ended in June. The Valley Forge, Pa., company raised its per-share earnings estimate to $5.52 to $5.57 for the fiscal year ending in September, from its previous estimate for per-share profit of $5.44 to $5.54. AmerisourceBergen said the improved outlook reflected its performance in the latest quarter. However, the company also expects its gross profit for the quarter ending in September will remain under pressure from weaker generic pricing trends as well as lower contributions from new generic drugs. In the latest quarter, pharmaceutical distribution revenue grew 8% to $35.4 billion and revenue in its other businesses increased 2.8% to $1.6 billion. The company's performance has been helped by its acquisitions of MWI Veterinary Supply Inc. and PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings Inc. For the period ended June 30, AmerisourceBergen reported a profit of $349.8 million, or $1.56 a share, up from $214.2 million, or 89 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding litigation-settlement gains and other items, adjusted per-share earnings rose to $1.37 from $1.20. Revenue increased 7.7% to $36.88 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of $1.27 and revenue of $36.71 billion.

ABC,"The post-Brexit blues didn’t last long. As anyone who has followed the market knows, global equities went on a roller-coaster ride in the wake of Britain’s surprise vote to leave the European Union on June 23. Taking a cue from Europe, stocks in the U.S. rallied hard in the run-up to the results as investors went all-in that the vote would be to “stay,” as indicated by bookmakers, despite polls that showed the result too close to call. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  ended at 2,113.32 on June 23, just hours before results began rolling in. The shock “leave” victory triggered a sharp two-day selloff for U.S. stocks; the benchmark ended the following Monday, June 27, at 2000.54, a 5.3% drop from the pre-Brexit high. But the S&P 500 then rebounded and has since eclipsed its old all-time high. On Thursday, the S&P 500 recorded its fourth straight record close at 2,163.75, up 2.4% from its June 23 close and more than 8% from the post-Brexit closing low, even as companies warn that post-Brexit fallout is a key concern in their earnings calls. On Friday, stocks were struggling to hold on to gains. Which stocks were the biggest winners and losers? Here’s breakdown based on FactSet data: Winners—June 27 to July 14 Company Ticker Close—6/27 Close—7/14 Price Change American Airlines AAL, +2.18% $25.27 $35.88 42.0% Seagate Technology STX, +2.87% $20.87 $29.19 39.9% Endo International ENDP, +1.71% $13.69 $17.68 29.1% Freeport McMoRan FCX, +4.90% $10.13 $12.95 27.8% United Continental UAL, +2.30% $37.75 $47.85 26.8% Navient Corp.

American Airlines Group AAL, +2.18% for example, dropped 16.8% in two sessions. But shareholders who didn’t dump American in the post-Brexit carnage saw a rise of more than 18% between the June 23 close and Thursday’s close. Delta Air Lines DAL, +1.63%  was among firms discussing Brexit concerns in its earnings conference call, saying the sharp drop in the British pound led it to scale back 6 percentage points of its U.S./U.K. capacity for the winter. Airlines and other travel stocks were under pressure Friday after a terror attack in France left more than 80 people dead.

ABC,"Walgreens Boots Alliance said sales edged up in its latest quarter as it filled more prescriptions, though revenue fell short of expectations as shoppers bought less outside of the pharmacy. Shares in the company, down 2% this year through Tuesday's close, slipped 0.6% in premarket trading. The largest U.S. drugstore chain, formed when Walgreen and Alliance Boots merged at the end of 2014, has been working to reshape itself amid lower reimbursement rates and as the fast-changing U.S. health-care marketplace prompts consolidation. It is in the midst of completing its $9.4 billion acquisition of Rite Aid Corp., which Walgreens said Wednesday is on track to close in the second half of this year. Earlier this year it teamed up with United Healthcare Inc.'s pharmacy-benefit manager OptumRx, and last month Walgreens shook up its senior management ranks to lead what it says is the next phase of its evolutions. Also last month, the company pulled the plug on its three-year partnership with embattled blood-testing firm Theranos as regulators weigh sanctions against the firm for voiding certain test results. In its latest quarter, the Deerfield, Ill., company said overall sales at stores open at least a year grew 3.9%, better than the 3.7% analysts expected and up from the 2.2% pace -- the lowest in three years -- logged in the second quarter. Sales in Walgreens' pharmacy business jumped 6% on a comparable basis, nearly double the prior quarter's rate, as it filled 4.5% more prescriptions thanks to rising Medicare Part D volume. At the front end, where the company sells items from snacks to greeting cards to beauty products, sales inched up 0.1% after declining 0.3% a quarter earlier. Walgreens reiterated Wednesday that it is trying to beef up retail sales through new beauty offerings that it will continue to roll out this year. Over all for the period, Walgreens reported a profit of $1.10 billion, or $1.01 a share, down from $1.30 billion, or $1.18 a share, a year earlier. Excluding merger-related items and a change in the fair value of warrants exercised to buy a stake in AmerisourceBergen, among other things, per-share profit rose to $1.18 from $1.02. Revenue edged 2.4% higher to $29.50 billion. Analysts projected $1.04 in adjusted earnings per share on $29.71 billion in sales, according to Thomson Reuters. The company lifted the low end of its profit forecast for the year by a dime, now expecting to report $4.45 to $4.55 in adjusted earnings per share. Walgreens said the guidance assumes no impact from the pending Rite Aid deal.

ABC,"Drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp. swung to a profit for the March quarter but cut its earnings guidance for the current fiscal year amid continued generic-drug pricing pressures in the sector. Shares fell 7.5% to $78 in recent premarket trading as the company's second-quarter revenue also missed expectations. For the fiscal year ending in September, AmerisourceBergen lowered its per-share earnings guidance to $5.44 to $5.54, from its previous estimate for per-share profit of $5.73 to $5.83. Chairman Chief Executive Steven H. Collis said in prepared remarks Thursday that the reduced forecast reflects challenges from weaker generic pricing trends as well as lower contributions from new generic drugs. Contributions from the company's acquisitions of MWI Veterinary Supply Inc. and PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings Inc. helped AmerisourceBergen's performance in the March quarter, Mr. Collis stated. ""In addition, we have extended our contract with our largest pharmacy retail customer for an additional three years, and our large pharmacy benefit manager customer has extended their contract for an additional year,"" he said. For the period ended March 31, AmerisourceBergen reported a profit of $604.1 million, or $2.68 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $513.4 million, or $2.33 a share. Excluding one-time items, adjusted per-share earnings rose to $1.68 from $1.45. Revenue increased 9.3% to $35.7 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of $1.59 and revenue of $35.83 billion.

ABC,"U.S. stocks will be getting less support as the S&P 500 enters a more than month-long period in which companies cannot repurchase their shares, but some stocks are more vulnerable than others. Under Securities and Exchange Commission rules, companies are required to pause share buybacks during a so-called blackout period, which lasts about five weeks before each respective company’s earnings report until about 48 hours after results are announced. Looking at the S&P 500 Buyback Index, which tracks the top 100 stocks with the highest buyback ratios on the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at MKM Partners, noted that companies with relatively large buyback programs have slipped during their March-to-May blackout periods over the past two years compared with the broader S&P 500. And Krinsky said he thinks this year will be no different. “With the S&P 500 Buyback Index having outperformed the SPX by [about] 5% since the February lows, we think that trend could reverse,” Krinsky said. That said, Krinsky took note of eight stocks that appear particularly vulnerable to blackout periods given their higher than average reliance on buybacks and recent weak performance trends. “Presumably without the help of corporate buybacks, they could underperform in the months ahead,” Krinsky said.

ABC,"“Momentum stocks trade at an extreme premium to value stocks. Their valuation spread is the highest since 1980, except for during the tech bubble.” That’s what J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +1.82%  analyst Dubravko Lakos-Bujas wrote in a report Tuesday, as he discussed the signs of slowing economic growth in the U.S., “resulting in a more dovish” Federal Reserve as well as the “stabilizing/weakening” of the dollar. According to Lakos-Bujas, those combined factors are “providing implicit relief to [emerging markets] and commodity-linked equities.” And that could mean quite a bit to investors, as beaten-down stocks could rebound and soar. The “momentum stocks” to which Lakos-Bujas refers are part of a group that has performed quite well over the past several years. Momentum investing means you stick with the winners, rather than trying to decide which companies’ stocks are undervalued and primed for higher investment returns. There are plenty of good arguments to make for either strategy. Also see: Oil prices turn lower as traders question merit of ‘output freeze’ The idea is that the current stock market volatility, trading patterns and valuation within an industry group might set up a moment stock to underperform, even if the company has being doing well in increasing sales and earnings. An appearance on one of Lakos-Bujas’ lists doesn’t necessarily mean that J.P. Morgan Chase’s sell-side analysts have a certain rating on a stock — or any rating at all. J.P. Morgan provided its clients with two big lists of momentum stocks to avoid, and momentum stocks “at a reasonable price.” Here are five big companies the analysts included among momentum stocks to avoid: General Electric Co. GE, -1.46%  The stock has returned 17% over the past 12 months, with dividends reinvested, which compared to a negative 4% return for the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% according to FactSet. GE trades for 18.8 times the consensus 2014 EPS estimate, while the S&P 500 trades for 15.4 times the weighted aggregate 2016 EPS estimate. GE’s stock features a dividend yield of 3.26%. Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.11%  The stock has returned 34% over the past 12 months. Investors don’t value Amazon by traditional measures, such as price-to-earnings, because the company under founder and CEO Jeff Bezos always focuses on investment to grow sales and market share. Amazon disappointed investors with its fourth-quarter results, because of rising delivery costs. Other recent events include a new $5 billion stock-buyback plan. The company is reportedly considering opening hundreds of brick-and-mortar stores. Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.93%  The stock has returned a negative 11% over the past 12 months and trades for 15.7 times the consensus 2016 EPS estimate. The huge success of “Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens” helped Disney set an EPS record for its fiscal first quarter ended Jan. 2, while its revenue grew 14% from a year earlier. McDonald’s Co. MCD, -1.28%  The stock has returned 28% over the past 12 months, and trades for 21.9 times the consensus 2016 EPS estimate. The company has certainly changed investors’ opinions after years of slow growth. It grew fourth-quarter comparable sales by 5% during the fourth quarter and has tremendous momentum, driven by the successful rollout of all-day breakfast. The shares have a dividend yield of 3.02%. Starbucks Corp. SBUX, -0.02%  The stock has returned 23% over the past 12 months and trades for 29.5 times the consensus 2016 EPS estimate. The company increased its global comparable-store sales by 8% during its fiscal first quarter ended Dec. 27, but disappointed investors on a weaker-than-expected outlook for the fiscal second quarter. Here are the 17 momentum stocks that Lakos-Bujas and his team of analysts consider to be “at lower risk” while trading at “reasonable” prices: Company Ticker Industry Total return - past 12 months Price/consensus 2016 EPS estimate J.P.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. lowered the upper end of its guidance for the current year as the drug wholesaler reported that it swung to a profit during the quarter ended in December. For the fiscal year ending in September, AmerisourceBergen lowered the upper end of its per-share earnings estimate by seven cents and now expects per-share profit between $5.73 and $5.83. Chief Executive Steven H. Collis said in prepared remarks Thursday that the outlook reflects reduced expectations regarding prices of generic drugs and contributions from generic drug introductions as well as the effect of an early contract renewal. AmerisourceBergen in November completed its $2.58 billion acquisition of PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings Inc., which includes four compounding facilities that provide personalized medications to hospitals. In the latest quarter, pharmaceutical distribution revenue rose 7% to $35.2 billion. Nonpharmaceutical sales more than doubled to $1.6 billion, thanks to AmerisourceBergen's acquisition last year of MWI Veterinary Supply Inc., which distributes animal-health products in the U.S. and U.K. For the period ended Dec. 31, AmerisourceBergen reported a profit of $330.4 million, or $1.46 a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $199.5 million, or 91 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, adjusted per-share earnings rose to $1.27 from $1.14. Revenue increased 9.3% to $36.7 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of $1.25 and revenue of $36.86 billion. AmerisourceBergen has been forming ventures and collaborations with other health-care-related companies to increase bargaining power with drugmakers. AmerisourceBergen also said it reached a long-term distribution agreement on Thursday with Publix Super Markets Inc. Financial terms weren't disclosed. In 2013, AmerisourceBergen began an alliance with U.S. drugstore-chain operator Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH, which have since merged.

ABC,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. will hold a press conference at 8.00 a.m. Eastern to respond to allegations lobbed at the company regarding its relationship with specialty pharmacies and its accounting practices. Valeant VRX, +2.91% VRX, +2.65%  declined to do so for MarketWatch ahead of the press conference. TimeValeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:VRX $20.0 $15.0 $17.5 $22.5 Citron Research, John Hempton, ProPublica and The Wall Street Journal have said there is a tangled web of organizational ties between Valeant and specialty pharmacy network company Philidor RX, Philidor network member R&O Pharmacy, and other specialty pharmacies that may or may not be legally and financially related to Philidor and/or Valeant. Valeant shares fell as much as 40% at their worst level on Wednesday after Citron, a short selling firm, issued a scathing report, alleging that Valeant was shipping product to R&O and then falsely claiming the revenue. Citron’s report, which called Valeant a “pharmaceutical Enron,” cited a report that was published on Monday by the Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation, SIRF, that revealed the previously undisclosed relationships with specialty pharmacies. Valeant responded to Citron with a statement that said all sales to Philidor and its network pharmacies are “accounted for as intercompany sales and are eliminated in consolidation.” That would imply financial ownership of Philidor and an organizational connection with a distribution channel that had not been, until Monday, ever mentioned in Valeant’s financial statements or filings with the Canadian or U.S. securities regulators. Valeant had already responded to SIRF’s findings on its earnings call on Monday by saying that it has a “contractual relationship” with Philidor to fill prescriptions on its behalf, that it recently bought an option to buy the pharmacy, and that it also consolidates Philidor’s results with its own based on a variable interest entity (VIE) relationship. According to the guide to VIEs produced by Valeant’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers, a reporting entity must consolidate any other entity in which it has a controlling financial interest. That means Valeant already has voting control, most likely more than 50% of Philidor’s voting interest. That’s because under the VIE model, if Valeant is consolidating Philidor’s results, it must have the power to direct Philidor’s most significant economic activities and the ability to share in its profits. If all this is true, Valeant has a lot of explaining to do about why this is the first time anyone has ever heard of Philidor, and the special accounting for its revenues and inventory that’s required for such an entity. In addition, it’s not clear just how big of a channel the pharmacy network is, although Valeant said on its call that less than 5% of its inventory sits in specialty pharmacies. Two other large pharmaceutical firms, Allergan, plc. AGN, +1.59% and Endo International Inc. ENDP, +1.71% CA:ENL issued statements this week clarifying that they don’t depend to any great extent on the pharmacy network distribution channel. On the Monday call, Valeant Chairman and Chief Executive J. Michael Pearson, responding to questions about revenues from recent acquisition Salix, said that Valeant knows how much inventory is at its big three distributors—McKesson MCK, +0.15% AmerisourceBergen Corporation ABC, +1.29% and Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94% —because it has data sharing agreements with them. However, in its last annual report, the company says it uses third-party data to estimate the level of product inventories and product demand at other wholesalers and retail pharmacies. Pearson said information about anyone other than the big three is limited: “We don’t know how much inventory there is in some of the other distributors,” he said, “because there were no agreements in place to tell us that.” The SIRF article also highlights a court filing made by R&O Pharmacy and filed with the California District Court in September, in which the small regional pharmacy asks the court to block a demand for $69 million from Valeant for products that R&O said it had never received. The demand suggests R&O is a separate, third-party, non-affiliated company. But if R&O is actually owned by the Philidor organization, it would also be owned by Valeant. Valeant should also explain when, and to what extent, it is actually in the business of providing “back-end services, including call center, claims adjudication, IT and logistics support, as well as compliance/HIPPA regulation guidance, to other pharmacies, including R&O Pharmacy” as it says its consolidated entity Philidor is providing to its network of pharmacies. It’s also worth noting that Salix had a significant accounting restatement just before it was acquired by Valeant. Valeant revealed in its June 30 quarterly filing that the Securities and Exchange Commission is investigating the related accounting issues and possible securities law violations by Salix relating to disclosures of inventory amounts in the distribution channel and its disclosures.

ABC,"On April 6, 2015, CNBC host and best-selling author Jim Cramer wrote an article: “Jim Cramer’s Picks — Here are 49 Stocks to Buy Right Now,” published on TheStreet.com. Cramer made a strong case for the 49 stocks. “Every single one of these companies reported excellent last quarters, and with no exceptions their charts are pretty much perfectly made for this downturn,” Cramer wrote. Even if there was a correction or downturn, Cramer wrote that these stocks would do well. David O. England, a retired finance professor from Carbondale, Ill., decided to test Cramer’s stock buy list. On April 6, England bought $1,000 of each security on Cramer’s list in a paper-trade account (not including commissions) at the close of the following day. Tim Cook at WSJDLive: Apple Products in Customers' Lives England bet Cramer a dinner at the 17th Street BBQ restaurant in Murphysboro, Ill., one of the best rib houses in the country. If Cramer’s picks were profitable, England would pay. If Cramer’s picks were unprofitable, Cramer would pay. But Cramer never responded to the wager after repeated email and phone calls. (Here is the original MarketWatch column describing the rules of “The Cramer Challenge”) Absent Cramer’s cooperation, England went ahead and tracked the portfolio’s performance. England kept a weekly record of the results for the last six months. He also had the results audited by an independent third party. The final result? Even after the most recent 1,000-point Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  rally, Cramer got a failing grade. Although Cramer promised his picks could survive any downturn, these stocks didn’t survive during the market’s brutal third quarter. Only 14 of Cramer’s 49 stock picks closed higher after six months than their April trading price, a paltry 28% success rate. Click here to see the final performance results. Bottom line: England won the bet. (Note: The final results of Cramer’s picks are at the bottom of this column.) Cramer did not respond to e-mailed requests this week seeking comment about the recommended stocks’ performance. And England points out that he is not attacking Cramer personally, but takes issue with the quality of his stock picks. “It bothered me that so many experts publish buy lists,” England says, “but you never hear about the list again. I wanted readers to know that buying stocks based on a list is often a recipe for disaster.” Here are five other lessons that England shared: 1. Be careful about buying stocks based on a list. It’s better if you do your own homework. 2. In a downturn or bear market, even shares of “good” companies can go down, and by a lot. Look at Apple AAPL, +0.78%  or Wal-Mart WMT, +1.37%  , for example. 3. Be cautious about following anyone, especially well-known gurus. It’s okay to listen, but in the end you have to do your own research. But to blindly buy stocks based on a recommendation from a guru, a stockbroker, or a friend, usually leads to losses. 4. If you think about it, the list of 49 stocks are just 49 tips, and if there is anything you should know, never buy stocks based on tips. It’s rare that a tip works out. And if you buy based on a tip, will that person tell you when to sell? For example, if you had bought those 49 stocks, when do you sell? 5. Instead of “buy” lists, market gurus should call these “watch” lists. It would save investors of lot of time and aggravation. After all, Cramer’s 49 picks were supposed to protect you from a downturn. Unfortunately, these 49 stocks did no such thing.

ABC,"The S&P 500 finally nailed its longest winning streak of the year yesterday. That is five straight trading days of gains. What happens next depends on how brave investors are feeling. The index SPX, +1.38% closed at 1,987.05, a 1.8% gain yesterday, butting up against the 2,000 level, which has been a psychological wall hard for investors to scale. Hence, the debate about whether this latest run higher means that markets have shut the door on the volatility that struck in later summer, and which has been haunting it ever since. There’s a “65% chance this market has turned the proverbial corner,” Kent Engelke, chief economic strategist at Capitol Securities Management, told MarketWatch yesterday. Less optimistic is Mark Newton, a partner at Greywolf Execution Partners. Speaking to WSJ MoneyBeat’s Paul Vigna, Newton noted that since the year 1900, every single time the stock market has been off by 6% or more heading into October — that’s 22 times — it has failed to get back to positive ground by year’s end. Nine of those times, it has done even worse. Check out MoneyBeat here. Count former Pimco chief Bill Gross, who’s now at Janus Capital, as among those unwilling to take on that risk right now. In an interview with Bloomberg, he says investors need to sit this market out and get “cold water splashed on their faces.” But then, our call of the day sees the end of 2016 delivering big gains for global markets. As our chart of the day shows, any caution comes just as the VIX seems to be calming down. Maybe investors don’t give a ballyhoo about the angst on Wall Street anyway. As Convergex strategist Nick Colas notes, the average American investor is fairly apathetic about what’s going on the stock market, based on Google search terms since July. (h/t to Reformed Broker’s Josh Brown) Searches for the term “stockbroker” are down 6% over the past three months, notes Colas. But searches for political terms are up 50%, with — you guessed it — Donald Trump in the lead. Key market gauges There’s a bit of a pullback going on, with futures on the Dow US:YMZ5  and the S&P US:ESZ5  heading south, with earnings season starting to weigh on the minds of traders. The Nikkei NIK, +1.40%   got a boost from hopes that the Bank of Japan will deliver some easing moves at its meeting Wednesday. Europe SXXP, +0.44%  is limping early. Crude oil CLZ5, -0.17%  is lower ahead of U.S. inventory data. Gold US:GCZ5  is flat, and the dollar DXY, +0.00%  has lost some ground. The call Citigroup analysts weighed on stocks in a note released this morning, saying it’s “time to be brave (again).” A team led by Robert Buckland says the global bull market is “aging, but not finished.” They expect a 20% gain for global stocks by the end of 2016. Note they’re neutral on U.S. stocks, saying buy Europe, ex-U.K and Japan into the recent selloff. For one thing, they say global equities are pricing in a lower earnings-per-share outlook, which should protect prices against “inevitable negative EPS revisions.” Less sanguine was Bill Gross, who told Bloomberg a 10% drop for U.S. stocks is coming our way. He says downbeat economic data isn’t conductive to a rally such as what the market saw in 2013. The chart Crossing Wall Street’s Eddy Elfenbein has given the “all-clear” after the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, -12.68% known as the VIX, closed at 19.54 yesterday. “That doesn’t mean the market is about to surge higher, but it probably signals that the elevated volatility is behind us,” he writes. A VIX below 20 usually means less stress in the market, and it hasn’t closed under that level since August 20, when it closed at 19.1. Crossing Wall Streett All clear?

For the year ending in September, the company increased its per-share earnings estimate to $4.92 to $4.97 from its previous estimate for per-share profit of $4.85 to $4.95. In the latest quarter, pharmaceutical distribution revenue rose 10% to $32.8 billion, again boosted by the Walgreen Boots Alliance generic-pharmaceutical business. In 2013, AmerisourceBergen began an alliance with U.S. drugstore-chain operator Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH, which have since merged. Nonpharmaceutical sales more than doubled to $1.5 billion, thanks to AmerisourceBergen's acquisition earlier this year of MWI Veterinary Supply Inc., which distributes animal-health products in the U.S. and Britain. For the period ended June 30, AmerisourceBergen reported a profit of $214.2 million, or 89 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $12.8 million, or six cents a share. Excluding antitrust litigation settlement gains and other items, per-share earnings rose to $1.20 from $1.01. Revenue increased 13% to $34.23 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share profit of $1.15 and revenue of $33.98 billion.

ABC,"It’s much easier to buy stocks from a list than to find your own candidates. But can you make money this way? David O. England, a retired finance professor from Carbondale, Ill. who now offers investing classes and workshops, decided to test a recent stock “buy” list from well-known CNBC host and best-selling author Jim Cramer. And he’s challenging Cramer to put a meal where his mouth is. On April 6, 2015, “Jim Cramer’s Picks — Here are 49 Stocks to Buy Right Now,” was published on TheStreet.com. In the article, Cramer makes a strong case for these 49 stocks. “Every single one of these companies reported excellent last quarters, and with no exceptions their charts are pretty much perfectly made for this downturn,” Cramer wrote. Even if there is a correction or pullback, Cramer says these stocks will do well. Cramer writes, “This is THE list. Go forth and conquer.” To test Cramer’s picks, on April 6, England spent $49,000 in a paper-trade account, i.e. he bought $1,000 of each security not including commissions at the close of the following day. England is tracking Cramer’s performance on his website. He keeps a weekly record of the results, and after six months, he will publish the final results. The wager To make it interesting, England is betting Cramer a dinner at the 17th Street BBQ in Murphysboro, Ill., recently cited as one of the best rib houses in the country. The bet includes a round-trip (coach) airplane ticket. If Cramer’s picks are profitable (more stocks up than down) at the end of six months, England pays. If the picks are unprofitable, Cramer picks up the tab to send England to New York for ribs. Of course, this depends whether Cramer accepts the wager (so far, no word from Cramer). The purpose I asked England why he is tracking Cramer’s buy list. “I want hard-working people to know if they should buy stocks based on buy lists,” England says. “The bull market is getting long in the tooth so is it time to jump into new positions or take profits? I have tracked buy recommendations in the past and most have been bloodbaths.” He adds: “I am keeping an open mind on Cramer’s picks. If he hits a home run with his stocks, I will publicly praise him and treat him to dinner. If his picks are unprofitable, I’ll write about the dangers of buying stocks from buy lists without having a system.” What kind of system? “If you don’t rely on buy lists,” England says, “then you should learn how to do your own stock scans. I think people should be empowered to make their own financial decisions. Perhaps Cramer is an excellent stock-picker. I am not challenging him as a person, only the quality of his buy recommendations. I can’t wait to see who’s right.” The lesson There are many lessons to learn from this challenge. First, test the stocks by paper trading. Knowledgeable investors, meanwhile, can buy call options rather than individual stocks. The best idea is never to buy stocks based on tips or recommendations — even if they come from pros. U.S. GDP Swings to Contraction in First Quarter People will immediately invest $20,000 after hearing a stock tip from a stranger or unknowledgeable friend, but spend a month researching a $400 TV. If you feel compelled to buy any of the 49 stocks on Cramer’s list, or any other, first analyze and test whether the picks are credible. For reference, here are the 49 stocks Cramer recommended in his April 6 column: AutoNation AN, +2.03%   AutoZone AZO, +1.80%   CarMax KMX, +2.14% Cracker Barrel Old Country Store CBRL, +1.03%   Costco Wholesale COST, +2.63%   CVS Health CVS, -0.80%   Darden Restaurants DRI, +1.03%   Dillard's DDS, +0.96%   Dick's Sporting Goods DKS, +2.10% Dollar Tree DLTR, +1.05%   Dollar General DG, +0.66%   Hanesbrands HBI, +0.22%   Jack in the Box JACK, +0.25%   Jarden US:JAH   L Brands LB, +1.43%   Kroger KR, +1.35%   Kohl's KSS, +1.47%   Macy's M, +2.30%   Ross Stores ROST, +2.39%   Under Armour UA, +1.13%   Urban Outfitters URBN, +1.59%   Actavis ACT, +1.36%   AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29%   Boston Scientific BSX, +2.40%   Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94%   Cerner CERN, -1.09%   Cigna CI, -0.34%   Edwards Lifesciences EW, +2.01%   Humana HUM, +0.48%   Medtronic MDT, +2.24%   McKesson MCK, +0.15%   Perrigo PRGO, +0.90%   UnitedHealth Group UNH, -2.06%   Hormel Foods HRL, +1.96%   J.M.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. said its revenue rose 15% in the latest quarter, buoyed by strong demand for its specialty products and growth from its collaboration with Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. The drug wholesaler's revenue rose to $32.7 billion, slightly exceeding expectations of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters for $32.25 billion. AmerisourceBergen's board also authorized the repurchase of an additional $1 billion of the company's shares as part of its previously announced strategy to mitigate the potentially dilutive impact related to the exercise of the warrants held by affiliates of Walgreens Boots Alliance. For the year ending in September, the company raised its per-share earnings estimate to $4.85 to $4.95 and revenue growth view to 12% to 13%, from its previous estimate for a per-share profit of $4.45 to $4.55 and revenue growth of 10% to 11%. In 2013, AmerisourceBergen began an alliance with U.S. drugstore-chain operator Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH, which have since merged. In the latest quarter, pharmaceutical distribution revenue rose 14% to $31.8 billion, again boosted by the Walgreen generic-pharmaceutical business and sales of hepatitis C drugs. Nonpharmaceutical sales soared 72% to $986.1 million, thanks to a month of revenue from the recent acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply Inc., which distributes animal health products in the U.S. and Britain. For the period ended March 31, AmerisourceBergen reported a loss of $513.4 million, or $2.33 a share, compared with a year-earlier profit of $180.1 million, or 76 cents a share.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen is a distributor of drugs and health supplies based in Chesterbrook, Pa. It runs 26 U.S. pharmaceutical distribution centers, four U.S. specialty distribution centers, and two Canadian distribution hubs, in order to maximize supply chain efficiency. With some recent moves and some good growth, the stock appears to be a good one to check out for the space. The last time I wrote about this S&P 500 constituent, the company announced it was acquiring MWI Veterinary Supply for $190 per share. The acquisition is expected to add an additional $0.08 in earnings this year. I also was long the stock at the time that AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29%  announced the deal. The acquisition of MWI Veterinary Supply is expected to close soon, and as a result, several firms are raising their earnings estimates and upping their price targets and ratings on ABC stock. But most recently, UBS upgraded AmerisourceBergen to a buy from neutral. This firm's upgrade is based on the thesis that AmerisourceBergen has the ""greatest leverage"" to U.S. biosimilars, calling it ""the pony to ride"" to capture the upside related to the $65 billion in biologics that will be facing biosimilar competition over the next five years. What is a biosimilar? A biosimilar is a biological product whose approval is based on evidence it is highly similar to an already approved biologic, known as the reference product. While biosimilars have been used in Europe and Japan for a while, up until recently, there was no regulatory pathway in the U.S. But just this month the first biosimilar version of a drug received FDA approval in the U.S. And going forward, Amerisource Bergen is well leveraged to this business. Currently, three companies generate about 85%-90% of all revenue in the wholesale drug-distribution industry, AmerisourceBergen,Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94% and McKesson Corp MCK, +0.15% While AmerisourceBergen is not the largest competitor, is does have some the best revenue growth. What are some other factors driving growth for AmerisourceBergen? For one thing, the company is reaping the benefits of its 10-year contract with Walgreen WBA, -3.14%  to provide branded and generic drug products. AmerisourceBergen entered into a strategic agreement with Walgreen Boots Alliance in 2013, and clearly this relationship is paying off. Yet another factor driving results is sales momentum related to the sale of products to treat hepatitis C. New hep-C treatments are now available from Gilead Sciences GILD, +0.82% AbbVie ABBV, +0.40%  and Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% The company is bucking the trend of companies experiencing earnings difficulties and appears poised to outperform going forward. But AmerisourceBergen is not just a great growth story, it even pays a nice dividend yield of 1.0%. So let's take a closer look. Data from Best Stocks Now app AmericsourceBergen is a large-cap, $25 billion market-capitalization drug company. Its risk profile is conservative, and I own it in my conservative growth portfolio. Data from Best Stocks Now app AmerisourceBergen does not appear cheap on a valuation basis and rates a value grade of “D+,” but it is the growth story that makes the stock interesting. Its estimated 5 year annual growth rate is 11%, but that growth is rapidly accelerating due to strong growth in generic drugs and biosimilar agents, its partnership with Walgreen, and new drug availability in the hep-C segment. Data from Best Stocks Now app AmerisourceBergen receives a momentum grade of “B” and a performance grade of “A.” The stock has been a consistent outperformer relative to the Index. More recently, it is up more than 77% over the last year. And year to date, it is up an impressive 26.2%. Data from Best Stocks Now app AmerisourceBergen is ranked number 164 out of the more than 4000 companies in the Best Stocks Now universe. It receives a rating of weak buy with a stock grade of “B+.” There are huge opportunities in the drug-distribution segment given the growth in generics and biosimilars, new drug discoveries, and pharmacy alliances. AmerisourceBergen appears well positioned to capture these growth opportunities. Disclosure: Gunderson is long ABC, GILD, MCK and WBA.

ABC,"Cardinal Health Inc. raised its outlook for its fiscal year ending in June after the company posted forecast-topping results in its December quarter. Cardinal now expects to post $4.28 to $4.38 a share in earnings, up from its previous guidance for $4.10 to $4.30 a share in earnings. ""Although we experienced some continued challenges in the Canadian market, we saw real progress in most of our business lines and customer channels,"" said Chief Executive George Barrett in a news release. The Dublin, Ohio, company, which provides pharmaceuticals and medical products, was dealt a blow in 2013 when the drugstore chains that have since combined into Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. agreed to get their branded and generic pharmaceutical products from rival AmerisourceBergen Corp. Drug wholesalers have been forming ventures and collaborations with other health-care related companies, in an effort to boost their bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies and expand internationally. Cardinal Health agreed to form a joint venture with CVS Caremark Corp., in which the drugstore-operator and pharmacy-benefits manager source generic drugs as consumers increasingly are using the less-expensive medicines. For its fiscal second quarter, the company posted a profit of $289 million, or 86 cents a share, compared with $278 million, or 80 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings were $1.20 a share. Revenue grew 15% to $25.5 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters recently projected earnings of $1.10 cents a share on revenue of $23.5 billion. Revenue in the company's pharmaceutical segment grew 16% to $22.6 billion as it grew its existing and new customer bases.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. said Wednesday that its revenue rose 15% in the December quarter, buoyed by strong demand for its specialty products and gains from its collaboration with Walgreen Boots Alliance Inc. Results beat expectations, sending shares up about 3% in premarket trading. The company also raised its earnings outlook for the year ending in September to $4.45 to $4.55 a share, up from its previous range of $4.36 to $4.50 a share. Drug wholesalers like AmerisourceBergen have been forming ventures and collaborations with other health-care related companies to increase their bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies. In 2013, AmerisourceBergen began an alliance with U.S. drugstore-chain operator Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH, which have since merged. Earlier this month, the company agreed to buy MWI Veterinary Supply Inc. for $2.5 billion, expanding into the growing area of animal health. In its fiscal first quarter, pharmaceutical distribution revenue grew 15% to $33 billion, primarily due to the new Walgreen generic-pharmaceutical business, strong sales of hepatitis C products, and organic sales growth in its health systems and alternate-site customers. Within the segment, the specialty group saw revenue grow 26% due to good performance in the blood products category and increases in sales to community oncology practices. Nonpharmaceutical revenue also grew 15%, mostly due to demand for the company's consulting business. Overall, AmerisourceBergen reported a loss of $200 million, or 91 cents a share, compared with a profit of $41.3 million, or 17 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items including those related to the MWI transaction, earnings rose to $1.14 a share from 80 cents the year before. Revenue grew to $33.6 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had expected per-share earnings of 97 cents and revenue of $31.6 billion. Shares of AmerisourceBergen have risen 42% in the past 12 months as of Tuesday's close.

XOM, +2.47%  led losing stocks, both down about 2%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.64%  slumped 39.36 points, or 0.8%, to 4,664.71, as big losses in Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78%   dragged the index lower, in spite of a string of announced mergers and acquisitions among biotechnology companies. Meanwhile, as investors turned away from equities, havens such as government bonds and gold rallied. The 10-year Treasury yield US:10_YEAR which moves inversely to prices, fell 3 basis points to 1.91%. Gold prices US:GCG5  gained $17 to $1,233. Kim Caughey Forrest, investment analyst at Fort Pitt Capital, was not perturbed by the volatility. “Investors are reacting and sometimes overreacting to news, which is how markets are supposed to work. As long-term investors, we were a lot more nervous when markets kept marching in 2013 and 2014,” Forrest said. “Another slide in oil is bad news, because it is indicative of bigger issues in global economy. So, markets will react to that. Long-term investors should pay attention to stocks in their portfolios and periodically evaluate if the story behind why they own the stock is still intact. But for the most part, selling when everyone else is selling is a bad strategy,” she added. John Manley, chief equity strategist at Wells Fargo, noted that the momentum for the fourth-quarter earning expectations has shifted to less positive, as energy companies’ profits will be hit. “Investors are asking questions, like, how can oil fall 50% and not have repercussions, when the price is about 20% below the level at which most energy companies cut their capital expenditures,” Manley said. “However, we still believe that consumer spending, which dwarves capex spending, will benefit from lower oil prices and therefore will be net positive for the economy. We are in a period of higher volatility, but would consider any pullback of 8-12% as a buying opportunity,” he added. Oil still a worry: Oil futures plunged Monday, with the U.S. benchmark trading below the $46-a-barrel threshold for the first time in nearly six years after Goldman Sachs cut its crude outlook, predicting prices will remain low for a lengthy period. The investment bank slashed its Nymex 2015 crude forecast to $47.15 a barrel, from $73.75 a barrel, and cut its Brent estimate to $50.40 a barrel, from $83.75 a barrel. Société Générale also cut its oil-price forecasts.

ABC,"Cardinal Health Inc. said its revenue edged down 2% in the September quarter, hurt by the expiration of its contract with Walgreen Co. The company was dealt a blow last year when Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH agreed to get their branded and generic pharmaceutical products from rival AmerisourceBergen Corp. Drug wholesalers have been forming ventures and collaborations with other health-care related companies, in an effort to increase their bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies and expand internationally. Late last year, Cardinal Health agreed to form a joint venture with CVS Caremark Corp., in which the drugstore-operator and pharmacy-benefits manager source generic drugs as consumers increasingly are using the less-expensive medicines. The Dublin, Ohio-based company provides pharmaceuticals and medical products to more than 100,000 locations, while also offering direct-to-home distribution of medical supplies. For its first quarter ended Sept. 30, the company posted a profit of $266 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with $339 million, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding special items, earnings fell to $1 a share from $1.10. Revenue fell to $24.07 billion from $24.52 billion. Excluding the impact of the Walgreen contract expiration, revenue would have grown 13%, the company said. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters recently projected earnings of 96 cents a share on revenue of $22.43 billion. Revenue in the company's pharmaceutical segment fell about 3% to $21.21 billion because of the expiration of the Walgreens contract in the prior-year quarter. Excluding the impact of the Walgreens contract expiration, the segment's revenue would have grown 15%, the company said. Segment profit rose 4% to $451 million, driven by growth from new and existing customers. The medical segment's revenue increased 5% to $2.85 billion, driven by acquisitions, while profit climbed about 6% to $113 million. The company backed its outlook for full-year earnings.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. said its revenue increased 29% in the fourth quarter, driven by strong top-line gains in its pharmaceutical distribution business. For the recently started fiscal year, the drug wholesaler expects earnings of $4.36 to $4.50 a share on revenue growth of 7% to 8%. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters recently expected full-year earnings of $4.38 a share on revenue growth of 5%. Drug wholesalers have been forming ventures and collaborations with other health-care-related companies to increase their bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies and expand internationally. Last year, AmerisourceBergen began an alliance with U.S. drugstore-chain operator Walgreen Co. and European drug company Alliance Boots GmbH. The onboarding of all the new Walgreen-branded pharmaceuticals business and a chunk of the generic pharmaceuticals business helped drive up revenue this quarter, the company said. Earlier this year, the company launched its specialty drug-distribution joint venture with Profarma Distribuidora de Produtos Farmaceuticos SA, and completed its acquisition of a 19.9% stake in the Brazilian drug wholesaler. For the period ended Sept. 30, revenue rose to $31.59 billion from $24.47 billion. Pharmaceutical distribution revenue rose 29% to $31.02 billion.

In the latest period, the San Francisco company's distribution segment posted revenue growth of 37% to $44 billion, largely driven by contributions from its increased stake in German drug distributor Celesio AG and market growth.

ABC,"Walgreen Co. on Tuesday said same-store sales rose 5.2% in July, as strong pharmacy sales helped to offset weaker front-end traffic. Overall sales increased 6.1% to $6.39 billion. Walgreen in June pulled its goals for fiscal year 2016, saying key decisions still need to be made about its partnership with European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH, while also highlighting a number of pressures that hurt its pharmacy operations in the May quarter. Walgreen has an option to buy the rest of Switzerland-based Alliance Boots between February and August of next year. Executives intend to brief investors in the coming weeks on whether the company plans to acquire the remaining stake, how it would structure a deal and where the combined company would be based. Meanwhile, the company has faced lower third-party reimbursements, fewer brand-to-generic drug conversion and generic drug price inflation, all of which have hurt margins. A shift in consumers' drug purchases toward generics has led pharmacy companies to take steps to improve their performance, highlighted by the alliance between Walgreen and Alliance Boots with drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp. On Tuesday, Walgreen said same-store sales in the pharmacy section increased 7.6% in July. Same-store prescriptions filled increased 3.7%.

ABC,"Cardinal Health Inc. said its fiscal fourth-quarter revenue declined, hampered by the expiration of the drug wholesaler's contract with Walgreen Co. Its results for the period still topped consensus estimates. The company was dealt a blow last year when Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH agreed to get their branded and generic pharmaceutical products from rival AmerisourceBergen Corp.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp. said its fiscal third-quarter revenue rose 39% and beat expectations, driven by strong gains in its pharmaceutical distribution business. For the fiscal year, the drug wholesaler raised its per-share earnings estimate to $3.89 to $3.94 on revenue growth of 35%, up from its previous estimate of $3.64 to $3.74 a share on revenue growth between 30% and 34%. Drug wholesalers have been forming ventures and collaborations with other health-care related companies to increase their bargaining power with pharmaceutical companies and expand internationally. AmerisourceBergen last year began an alliance with U.S. drugstore-chain operator Walgreen Co. and European drug company Alliance Boots GmbH. Earlier this year, the company launched its specialty drug distribution joint venture with Profarma Distribuidora de Produtos Farmaceuticos SA, and completed its acquisition of a 19.9% stake in the Brazilian drug wholesaler, investing about $110 million. ""We delivered very strong performance in our June quarter, driven by the onboarding of substantial new business, and excellent operational and financial results,"" said Steven H. Collis, president and chief executive. ""In addition, we made important progress with our strategic objectives, and continued to make significant long-term investments in our business.""

Overall, AmerisourceBergen reported a loss of $12.8 million, or six cents a share, compared with a profit of $168.4 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. The company's cost of sales rose sharply during the quarter, up 39% at $29.66 billion.

ABC,"Getty Images In honor of our nation’s 238th birthday, we have put together a big list of publicly traded companies whose names include the words “America” or “United States,” or any abbreviation or combination of the two. Whimsical? A bit. Silly? Certainly not. Any arbitrary method of producing a decent-sized list of publicly traded companies is sure to highlight some quality stocks for further inspection. We began with the components of the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% the S&P MidCap 400 MID, +1.35%   and the S&P SmallCap 600 SML, +0.99%  and added a list of U.S. energy stocks supplied by FactSet. We then pared the list to companies with any version of the nation’s name, with market values of at least $100 million. That left us with 47 stocks. The 20 listed above had an average total return of 20% during the first half of the year, which was nearly triple the total return of the benchmark S&P 500 Index. The financial sector is best represented on the list, with real estate investment trusts, big banks and insurance companies. There are also plenty of oil and gas stocks, and a few utilities. What follows is a brief discussion for each of the 20 best “American” stock performers during the first half of 2014. You can click on each company’s name to see current stock quotes and lists of articles mentioning the company. U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA, +0.51%  of Frederick, Md., was the top-performing “American” stock, with a total return of 63.5% through Monday’s close. The company provides silicate products for use in oil and gas production, and manufacturing. It has grown its annual sales per share for four straight years. The stock rose 9% on April 29 after the company reported a 45% increase in sales of sand used in hydraulic fracturing. “We are currently sold out of all grades of frac sand and believe that industry demand growth will continue to outpace planned supply additions,” CEO Bryan Shinn said in the company’s earnings release. U.S. Silica expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2014 to increase to a range of $180 million to $200 million from $160.8 million in 2013. The stock closed at $55.44 on Monday, and trades for 19.1 times the consensus 2015 earnings estimate of $2.91 a share, among analysts polled by FactSet, up from an estimated $1.97 this year.

US:RAI  of Winston-Salem, N.C., is the second-largest cigarette maker in the U.S., and its stock has returned 24% this year to $60.35, assuming dividends were reinvested. Tobacco stock are cash plays, and Reynolds American boasts a dividend yield of 4.44%.

The good news included increased market share for all four of the company’s key brands, including Camel, Pall Mall, Grizzly and Natural American Spirit. American Electric Power Co.

First-quarter operating revenue was down 8% to $101.9 million, mainly because of a 32% drop in contracted services revenue, which had been expected as projects at two bases were completed. The company expects contract revenue to increase over the rest of the year. Net income was $11 million, or 28 cents a share, down from $13.5 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier.

ABC,"Walgreen Co.'s Chief Executive Greg Wasson on Tuesday said for the first time that the company is weighing moving outside of the U.S., as it considers buying the shares it doesn't already own in European pharmacy group Alliance Boots GmbH. Under pressure from shareholders to use a merger with Alliance Boots to cut its tax bill through a so-called inversion, Mr. Wasson said the company is looking at how to structure its tax liabilities as part of its discussions over whether to buy the remaining 55% of Alliance Boots it doesn't already own. Walgreen, based in Deerfield, Ill., plans to hold a conference call in the coming weeks to lay out its plans. ""We're looking at all and everything,"" Mr. Wasson said in response to a question about inversions from an analyst on a conference call. He said the company is looking at the tax structure and ""what the structure could do as far as our effective tax rate."" The company is also considering other issues, such as the timing and the structure of a deal to obtain the remainder of Alliance Boots, but investors have been focusing more on whether Walgreen can lower its tax bill by relocating its corporate home overseas to Switzerland, where Alliance Boots is based. Inversions have been gaining popularity of late as American companies seek to lower corporate tax rates and to keep cash earned overseas out of the reach of U.S. tax authorities. Pharmaceutical companies have led the recent flurry of the inversion activity and it would be rare step for a U.S.-based retailer to move abroad. Mr. Wasson as recently as March had sworn off considering doing an inversion. ""Just to reiterate, as I said on the last call, we have no plans to do an inversion,"" he said on a March 25 earnings call. But other executives softened that stance in more recent public comments, saying that a move is something the company would consider. Pressure could rise for such a move after Walgreen reported weaker-than-expected earnings, as margins in its pharmacy business were squeezed by higher prices for generics and lower reimbursement rates. With Alliance Boots also not increasing profit as fast as expected, Walgreen had to scrap its 2016 financial guidance. The company also now expects to wring more cost out of the partnership, as it makes spending cuts and combines operations. Walgreen spent $6.7 billion in 2012 to buy 45% of Alliance Boots, with the option to buy the entire company before 2016. For its fiscal third quarter ended May 31, Walgreen's profit rose to 16% to 722 million from a year earlier, while revenue rose 5.9% to $19.4 billion. Sales, excluding newly opened or closed locations, rose by 4.8%, even as customer traffic slowed, helped by bigger basket sizes and better pharmacy sales. Walgreen will also lay out new financial targets for the combined company at a meeting in late July or early August.

ABC,"Walgreen Co. said its fiscal third-quarter earnings climbed 16% as the drug-store operator posted continued sales improvement, though customer traffic declined slightly. Shares edged down about 3% premarket as the top and bottom lines grew less than expected and the company pulled its goals for fiscal year 2016, saying key decisions still need to be made about its Alliance Boots partnership. A shift in consumers' drug purchases toward generics has led pharmacy companies to take steps to improve their performance, highlighted by an alliance between Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH with drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp. Walgreen Chief Executive Greg Wasson said Tuesday that he and Alliance Boots Executive Chairman Stefano Pessina are working on step two of their partnership, pointing to ""complex issues in planning."" The company now expects the second year of its partnership with Alliance Boots to generate $400 million to $450 million in cost savings, up from $375 million to $425 million. The company also said Tuesday that it is experienced increased pressure on pharmacy margins amid lower third-party reimbursement, fewer brand-to-generic drug conversions and generic drug price inflation. In the latest quarter, Walgreen's overall gross margin shrank to 28% from 28.5%. Still, the company ""continued to see improving top-line growth in the third quarter driven by increased daily living sales and strong increases in both prescriptions filled and our pharmacy market share,"" Mr. Wasson said. For the period ended May 31, Walgreen reported a profit of $722 million, or 75 cents a share, up from $624 million, or 65 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding acquisition-related impacts and other items, per-share earnings rose to 91 cents from 85 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 94 cents. The latest period's adjusted earnings included a per-share contribution of 15 cents from Alliance Boots. Revenue rose 5.9% to $19.4 billion, slightly below the $19.49 billion the company estimated earlier this month. Sales, excluding newly opened or closed locations, rose by 4.8%, including growth of 2.2% in the front of the store and a 6.3% increase in the pharmacy section. Customer traffic decreased 0.7%, while basket size increased 2.9%. The company earlier this year unveiled plans to close 76 drugstores in the second half of the year, reversing some of its rapid expansion over recent years.

ABC,"Walgreen Co. said its fiscal second-quarter earnings eased as the drug-store operator was hit by weaker margins tied to a slowdown in generic drug introductions and a milder flu season. The company also unveiled plans to close 76 drugstores in the second half of the year, reversing some of its rapid expansion in recent years. However, Walgreen still expects its store count to increase by 55 to 75 for the year. A wave of generic drug introductions that has pressured sales at drugstore retailers slowed in the latest period, narrowing the company's gross margin to 28.8% from 30.1%. Generic drugs carry higher margins than brand-name medicines. ""Our second-quarter performance, in spite of expected headwinds from slower generic drug introductions, comparisons with last year's flu season and severe weather, was marked by solid top-line growth driven by record quarterly sales and record second-quarter prescriptions filled,"" said Chief Executive Greg Wasson. The shift in consumers' drug purchases toward generics has led pharmacy companies to take steps to improve their performance--including an alliance by Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots with drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp. The company now expects cost savings during the second year of its partnership with Alliance Boots to generate $375 million to $425 million in cost savings, up from $350 million to $400 million. For the period ended Feb. 28, Walgreen reported a profit of $754 million, or 78 cents a share, down from $756 million, or 79 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding acquisition-related impacts and other items, adjusted earnings fell to 91 cents from 96 cents. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected 93 cents. The latest period's adjusted earnings included a per-share contribution of eight cents from Alliance Boots, at the high end of company estimates. The company recently reported that total drugstore sales rose 5.1% to $19.61 billion, above analysts expectations at the time. Same-store sales improved 4.3%, including growth of 2% in the front of the store and a 5.8% increase in the pharmacy section. Same-store customer traffic fell 1.4%, while basket size increased 3.4%. The store closure plans are expected to benefit adjusted per-share earnings by two cents to three cents starting during the next fiscal year. Walgreen also expects to post charges related to the move of $240 million to $280 million, mostly in the third and fourth quarters.

ABC,"Beating the market can be difficult when you pick stocks on your own. One common source of alpha can be focusing on small cap stocks, which tend to outperform their larger peers over time. Another source of alpha can be following the smart money, by mimicking the trades of professional investors. Our research has shown that, by combining these two approaches — buying the most popular small-cap stocks recently purchased by hedge funds — investors outperformed the market by 18 percentage points a year on average (read the details here). We have been forward testing this strategy since August 2012 and its stock picks returned 87% since then. Rite Aid Corp. RAD, +0.60% was one of the more heavily bought stocks by hedge funds recently, with Peter Rathjens' Arrowstreet Capital, David E. Shaw's of D E Shaw and Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group increasing their stakes significantly during the fourth quarter of 2013. In addition, Jerome L. Simon of Lonestar Capital Management initiated a new position during the quarter, while Phill Gross / Robert Atchinson of Adage Capital Management and Sander Gerber of Hudson Bay Capital Management added to their positions. Rite Aid is a $6.4 billion market capitalization company that is the third largest drug retailer in the U.S., with 4,592 stores located in both the East and West Coasts and annual revenue of $25.4 billion. The stock has rallied since December 2012, when it reported its first quarterly profit in years thanks to making good progress on its turnaround plan. RAD has continued to execute on its plan ever since (including during the most recent fiscal third quarter ended November 30, 2013, when it increased its forward guidance above consensus expectations), increasing its EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) from a low of $859 million in fiscal year 2011 to $1.3 billion for the last 12 months through its third quarter of fiscal year 2014, through a combination of reinvigorated top-line growth, reduced selling, general and administrative expenses and refinancing of its debt. In addition to its fundamental improvement, RAD could be a participant in the ongoing transformation of the drug industry in the U.S. Prescription drug distributors have formed alliances with retail pharmacies to gain more pricing leverage with drug manufactures while obtaining larger scale in higher-growth international markets. The trend started in 2012, when drug retailer Walgreen Co. US:WAG acquired a 45% stake in privately-held Alliance Boots GmbH, a U. K-based wholesaler and retailer. Shortly thereafter, the two firms formed a partnership with drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% Naturally, speculation began on the Street regarding the next possible deal, with some expecting RAD to be acquired by U.S. drug distributor McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15% Those hopes were subsequently dashed when MCK agreed to buy German pharmacy Celesio AG (DB: CLS1) for $8.4 billion in October 2013. However, the possibility of another suitor is still in the cards. The shares aren't cheap, trading at forward P/E and EV/EBITDA multiples of 22.3X (versus 19.1X for peer group) and 9.6X (versus 9.9X for peers), respectively. However, with continued progress on its turnaround plan, RAD offers a way to gain exposure to favorable secular trends — including an aging population that tends to fills their prescriptions at retail pharmacies and expansion of prescription drug insurance coverage due to the Affordable Care Act (ACA)—at a reasonable valuation. A potential acquisition by another drug distributor would be an added bonus but not central to the investment thesis on the stock.

Drugstore retailers like Walgreen have posted higher margins lately, aided by a wave of generic-drug offerings that carry higher profitability than nongenerics. However, generic drugs also command lower prices. The shift in consumers' drug purchases toward generics has led pharmacy companies to take steps to improve their performance--including a recent alliance by Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots with drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp.

The companies also extended Cardinal Health's distribution agreement with CVS by three years to 2019. The companies said the venture is expected to be fully operational as soon as July and would form the largest generic sourcing entity in the U.S. For an initial 10 years, the venture will source and negotiate generic supply contracts for both companies.

Industrywide, a wave of major generic drug introductions has put pressure on pharmacy revenue.

ABC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Expect a heightened focus on revenue and corporate capital expenditure spending as earnings season reaches its midpoint this week. Last week, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  finished up 1.1%, the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38%   gained 0.9% to finish at a new record close of 1,759.77, and the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64%  advanced 0.7% after a peak earnings week. On the surface, results from the biggest U.S. companies appear relatively strong, and that’s helped support stock gains. Europe’s Week Ahead: U.K. Housing, Nokia Earnings With nearly half the S&P 500 and more than two-thirds of the Dow industrials having already reported quarterly results, the current earnings season is looking to be the best of the year in terms of how companies are beating expectations. And S&P 500 earnings are on their way to setting a new record high. “What’s occurring is that U.S. corporations are benefitting from being the best house in a bad neighborhood,” said Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets. Much of that has to do with corporate America stripping away costs in a challenging global revenue environment, Belski said. A wave of earnings beats last week significantly bumped up the percent of companies topping forecasts. After this past week, 75% of S&P 500 companies have topped the earnings consensus this season, compared with the four-year average of 73%, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet. Prior to last week’s reports, the earnings beat rate had been running at 69%. This will be a “Dow-a-day” week of quarterly results with Merck & Co. MRK, -1.13%  on Monday, Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.54%  on Tuesday, Visa Inc. V, +2.25%  on Wednesday, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +2.47%  on Thursday, and Chevron Corp. CVX, +1.73%  on Friday. The Next 24: Apple, Facebook, and the Fed Plus, more than 120 companies on the S&P 500 report next week with notable releases from Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78% and Biogen Idec Inc. BIIB, +0.74%  on Monday; Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, +0.82%  and Allergan Inc. AGN, +1.59%  on Tuesday; Starbucks Corp. SBUX, -0.02%  , General Motors Co. GM, +2.45% and Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +2.67%  on Wednesday; along with MasterCard Inc. MA, +2.82%  and ConocoPhillips COP, +0.95%  on Thursday. And Nasdaq stock Facebook Inc. FB, +4.42%  reports Wednesday. Easier to beat Some strategists, however, are less than impressed with earnings. Earnings beats have become a less significant metric because the results compare with lowered expectations. In late June, analysts on average forecast earnings-per-share growth for the third quarter would be around 6% year-over-year. By the time earnings season started, they had trimmed that growth outlook to less than 1%. The beats don’t “seem to be all that clean,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief U.S. strategist at Citi Research, in a recent note. “Moreover, a good number [of companies] have made or topped forecasts on lower than expected tax rates or one-time items, suggesting that results were not necessarily comprised of high quality beats,” Levkovich noted. “Accordingly, it is challenging to argue that the reporting season has been all that good when some detailed insight is applied.” RBC Capital Markets The average quarterly earnings surprise. Also, corporations giving outlooks for the fourth quarter continue to be negative, which places pressure on analysts to lower their estimates. About 86% of fourth-quarter earnings outlooks (49 out of 57 companies on the S&P 500) have been negative, meaning the forecast falls below the current Wall Street consensus, according to Butters. Over the past five years, on average, about 63% of companies giving a quarterly earnings outlook provided one that’s below the consensus. With much of corporate America still conservative about costs, a metric that’s useful to look out for is a company’s mention of capital expenditure spending, Belski said. A prime example of that was Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.10%  earnings last week. Not only did Microsoft top earnings estimates but revenue was $730 million higher than the Wall Street consensus due to a big boost in spending from businesses. • Need to Know: Critical intelligence before the U.S. markets open Given excess volatility in Europe and emerging markets, expect to see more of an acceleration of capital expenditure spending going into 2014, Belski said. Revenue may be a cleaner indicator during earnings season because fewer companies on average are managing to top consensus estimates. Revenue beats for the S&P 500 are actually running below the four-year average of 59% this season with only 52% of companies reporting top-line results above the Wall Street consensus, according to Butters. One group that’s beating the average so far this season is a list of 20 companies, excluding financial and utilities, that Goldman Sachs estimated would be top contributors to third-quarter revenue growth on the S&P 500. So far, nine out of 11 companies on that list, or 82%, have beaten the revenue consensus by an average 1.6%, according to FactSet data. The big upside surprises go to Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. FCX, +4.90%  (8.7% above consensus with $6.17 billion in revenue) and Microsoft (4.1% above consensus with $18.53 billion in revenue.) The other companies on the list that beat revenue estimates were Ford Motor Co. F, +2.03%  , Google Inc. GOOG, +2.71%  , Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.11%  , WellPoint Inc. US:WLP  , McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  , Boeing Co. BA, +2.46%  , and Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.37%  UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06%  and United Technologies Corp. UTX, +1.10%  missed the revenue consensus. Companies on the Goldman list reporting this week include LyondellBasell Industries NV LYB, +2.45% Aetna Inc. AET, -0.25%  , AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  , Chevron, Marathon Petroleum Corp. MPC, +1.80%  , and Eaton Corp. ETN, +1.09% Less impact from the Fed On Tuesday, the Federal Open Market Committee will kick off its two-day policy meeting. Expectations are very low for any action to taper the Fed’s $85 billion a month in asset purchases. With soft economic numbers and the Fed’s decision not to taper in September ahead of the government shutdown, isolated daily data points are less likely to drive investors to act as the focus turns to longer-term trends on whether the economy is softening or firming up, Belski said. “The Fed’s not going to taper for a while,” Belski said. “Bernanke foreshadowed that in September.” Many forecasters estimate that a tapering of asset purchases won’t happen until least March or April. Economic data on tap next week includes the Case-Shiller home price index and consumer confidence index on Tuesday, Chicago PMI on Thursday, and the ISM manufacturing index on Friday.

ABC,"Walgreen Co.'s WAG September same-store sales jumped 7.4% as more people got flu shots, though store traffic dropped. Susquehanna Financial Group had forecast a 6.6% rise. Drugstore retailers like Walgreen have posted higher gross margins recently, helped by a wave of generic-drug offerings that carry higher profitability than nongenerics. However, generic drugs also command lower prices. The shift in consumers' drug purchases toward generics has led pharmacy companies to take steps to improve their performance--including a recent agreement by Walgreen and European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH with drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% Walgreen said same-store sales were helped by 1.9 percentage points due to calendar day shifts, but hurt by 0.5 points over generic drug introductions in the last 12 months. Walgreen's front-end same-store sales climbed 2.9% and comparable pharmacy sales rose 10% last month. Same-store prescriptions filled climbed 9.6% in September, helped in part by more flu shots versus a year earlier. Flu shots administered at pharmacies and clinics season-to-date were more than 1.9 million versus about 1.6 million last year. Same-store customer traffic declined 0.8%, while basket size increased 3.7%. Total September sales rose 8% to $5.92 billion. Walgreen earlier this week reported its fiscal fourth-quarter profit jumped 86% as pharmacy section's sales continued to improve. Shares closed Wednesday at $56.53 and were inactive premarket.

When market participants liquidate foods, beverages, tobaccos, drugs and household products, and purchase retailers, restaurants, broadcasters, appliances and entertainment, it is unlikely they are doing so with the idea that the economy will roll over anytime soon. Worthwhile trends in the market are not sustained by our next-door-neighbor Bill; they are fed by institutions. While anyone's logic can be questioned, the market is pretty smart. And arguing with it, and the extremely deep pockets of institutions, can be pretty expensive. It can be like arguing with the ocean's waves. They are there to be ridden. Or not. But not to be argued with if one is a short- to medium-term player. For an active individual investor, the advantage is that large investors leave tracks on the tape for anyone to see. These tracks can form trends, or waves, and can be ridden just like the ones in the ocean. Challenging, for sure. But it can be done. No one puts up a sign saying institutions are buying stock. But the evidence has been, and continues to be there for those interested in rolling up their sleeves. Blue-chip growth shares like Costco Wholesale COST, +2.63% putting the finishing touches on a six-week cup on volume; Starbucks SBUX, -0.02% breaking out of a five-week base on volume; Amerisourcebergen ABC, +1.29% clearing its own five-week cup; Baidu BIDU, +0.04% driving out of a four-week consolidation on volume 63% above normal; Mastercard MA, +2.82% leaving its five-week cup; and Priceline.com US:PCLN closing in on the top of its five-week cup were just six of Wednesday's sights. Beyond the larger growth issues, one of the more striking characteristics since the April lows is the raft of emerging growth titles ""building and breaking out of bases."" Longtime readers recognize these words as being the most bullish descriptor of general market health found in this column. Since 1990, the presence of scores of titles building and breaking out of bases has almost always led to richer quotations in the intermediate-term, with perhaps three exceptions. (The most recent anomaly occurred in May 2010 when the flash crash took the market by surprise.) In fact, the number of emerging growth issues being embraced by large investors is believed to be the most since 2000. The advances of 2003, 2006-2007, and 2009 never had this combination of speculative sentiment and young, dynamic growth companies. The question was asked on the Twitter feed whether this degree of growth-stock leadership might be too much for comfort. No. The precedent of the '80s and 's proved that bull markets can go a long way while led by dynamic companies with innovative products and services. Eventually, the Street will come out with too much product in the way of initial offerings for the market's good. The silver lining there is that many of those issues will provide the seeds for the next bull market. Until then, the market will not top until it does. That should be the credo of the speculator. Among the names, Yelp YELP, +1.14% the online consumer-review platform, is expected to go from an 11-cent-a-share loss in 2013 to a 24-cent-a-share profit in 2014. Notably, sequential quarterly revenue has grown by 10%+ over the last several quarters, a sign of fast growth. Moreover, quarterly revenue growth is up 63%, 66%, 67%, 63%, 65%, 68% and 69% in recent quarters, exceptionally steady for such a high-growth vehicle. Technically, what with its triple in the last five months, YELP is in the 99th percentile for relative strength over the past year. Its industry group is in the 97th percentile. Leading titles in leading groups are always accorded special attention. YELP vaulted out of a five-week cup pattern last Friday on volume 198% above normal. Price is slightly extended above the base top and does not offer attractive entrance. A pullback would make more sense; the stock may offer one before too long. Worth watching.

ABC,"As we approach all-time highs in the S&P 500, we wanted to look at the top 10 most overbought names in the index. As expected, these names are compiled in the defensive sectors such as consumer goods, health care and some consumer services. These names have lead since the second part of the rally took hold in mid December. On the chart page attached below, we show the defensive sectors’ divergence from the aggressive, more cyclical sectors. The most overbought names are in ascending order, some of which happen to be on our strongest 20 S&P list, as money continually chases defensive, higher-yielding stocks as investor look for yield. The Kroger Co KR, +1.35%   Hormel Food HRL, +1.96%   John & Johnson JNJ, +0.55%   AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29%   Health Care REIT US:HCN   Kimberly-Clark Corporation KMB, +0.61%   Kellogg K, +1.74%   GIS, +1.60%  General Mills Celgene CELG, +0.90%   H&R Block HRB, +1.03%   If we get a meaningful pullback it would not be unexpected for these names to revert the hardest, as investors have significant gains in these names. Another reason would be the further away the price deviates from its mean, the greater the risk of falling to its mean. We haven't seen evidence yet of a rotation into cyclical stocks just yet and the current trend could remain much longer than anyone can predict. However, this could be a potential trade setup for a nice mean-spread trade that would have these two sectors realign to their historical mean.

ABC,"Cardinal Health Inc.'s CAH, +0.94% fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 3.6% amid a tax benefit and as stronger margins offset lower pharmaceutical sales revenue. For the fiscal year, the company raised its per-share earnings estimate to $3.67 to $3.71, from its previous estimate for $3.42 to $3.50. The company's board also authorized a 10% increase in Cardinal's quarterly dividend to 30.25 cents a share. Cardinal Health was dealt a blow in March as Walgreen Co. WAG and European drug giant Alliance Boots GmbH formed an alliance with rival drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% that could give the companies an advantage in demanding lower prices from drug makers. The distribution pact with AmerisourceBergen replaces Cardinal's contract with Walgreen that expires in August. Last year, Cardinal also lost its contract with pharmacy-benefits manager Express Scripts Holding Co. ESRX, -0.93% to AmerisourceBergen. For the latest quarter, Cardinal's pharmaceutical segment reported revenue declined 10% mostly on the nonrenewal of the Express Scripts contract and brand-to-generic conversions, though segment earnings were up 12%.

(CVS), where Cardinal also faces a near-term contract renewal battle. ""Our organization is successfully innovating and adapting our business lines and portfolio to an evolving market, with a focus on establishing a strategic edge in areas of higher growth,"" Chief Executive George Barrett said Thursday, pointing to the company's recent $2.1 billion acquisition of AssuraMed Holding Inc., which sells medical supplies directly to patients.

ABC,"An earlier version of this column had incorrectly quoted Apple’s stock price for Tuesday. The story has been corrected. SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Apple Inc. marked the one-year anniversary of the announcement of its first dividend by closing marginally lower while Lululemon Athletica Inc. attracted attention for the wrong reason: pants that are too sheer. Top Tickers Trending $AAPL: When Apple AAPL, +0.78%  said on March 19, 2012 that it was initiating a quarterly dividend, the stock rallied 2.7% to $601.10. Exactly six months later, Apple hit its historic high closing price of $702.10. Now, six months on, with investors clamoring for the company to explain what it will do with its $137 billion cash hoard, the stock closed at $454.49, down about 35% from its September peak.

That will undoubtedly pressure Apple to not only beat Samsung to market and offer a device that can offer superior features. As expected, the news prompted some speculation that Samsung is once again trying to steal Apple’s thunder if not its idea. But before the narrative gets too twisted, there are a couple of important facts to remember. Samsung has been making watches since 1983 and smartwatches have been around for a while. $MSFT: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.10%  shares recovered from earlier losses to close slightly higher. The Wall Street Journal reported that regulators are investigating Microsoft’s business relationship with partners that allegedly bribed foreign government officials in return contracts. “Lawyers from the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are examining kickback allegations made by a former Microsoft representative in China, as well as the company’s relationship with certain resellers and consultants in Romania and Italy,” the Journal reported. The probe is the early stage and Microsoft has not been accused of any wrongdoing, the newspaper said. $LULU: Lululemon Athletica LULU, +3.68% shares are paying a steep price after the maker of athletic clothing for women announced a product recall on Monday that affects forecasts for first-quarter same-store sales and revenue. The recall is for its Luon pants and cropped pants, which are made from nylon and Lycra spandex and are considered too transparent. In a statement titled “Black Luon Pants Shortage Expected,” the company said the move will affect about “17% of all women’s bottoms.” $C: Citigroup Inc. C, -1.11%  trended online. The bank’s price target was raised to $53 from $46 on Tuesday by Deutsche Bank. The bank also agreed to pay $730 million on Monday to settle allegations it misled investors during the financial crisis. $BA: Boeing Co. BA, +2.46%  sparked chatter after Ryanair Holdings PLC announced an agreement with Boeing on Tuesday to buy 175 new Next Generation 737-800 airplanes in a deal valued at almost $15.6 billion. Gainers S&P: Brighter Outlook for China Property Market AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  rose 3.6% while Walgreen Co. US:WAG  added 5.4%. Walgreen and Alliance Boots announced on Tuesday an agreement to buy pharmaceutical products from AmerisourceBergen, a drug wholesaler, as they gained the right to buy a minority position in the company. Shares of Skullcandy Inc. US:SKUL  gained 7.5%. The headphone maker said Monday it hired Hoby Darling, a digital executive from Nike Inc. NKE, +1.53%  as chief executive and president. Decliners Affymax Inc. AFFY, +0.65%  shares plunged 64%. The biotechnology company said Monday it will reduce its workforce by 75% and may sell itself. Both actions are linked to an investigation of Affymax’s antianemia drug Omontys, which it recalled after it led to fatal reactions in some first-time users. Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94%  shares slid 8.2%. The stock was downgraded to neutral from buy at Lazard Capital Markets following Walgreen’s deal with AmerisourceBergen. “This morning, WAG announced a new relationship with ABC that, among other things, includes a 10-year distribution agreement between the retailer and that wholesaler. As such, CAH will be losing the WAG business, which represents $20 billion plus revenue. We had roughly estimated WAG represents about 7.5% of CAH EPS,” Tom Gallucci, an analyst at Lazard, said in a note. Lululemon Lululemon store. Chesapeake Energy Corp. CHK, +1.00% shares are off 5.1%. The natural-gas producer said Monday that it is looking into selling $2.3 billion in bonds to finance a debt buyback. Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. CLF, +5.30%  shares shed 6.6%, down for a second day. An analyst at Bank of America cut the price target on Cliffs to $25 from $30, Benzinga reported Monday. The stock of the iron-ore producer is the biggest loser so far in 2013, down 47% year to date. After an initial spike from the resignation of Chief Executive John Riccitiello, Electronics Arts Inc. EA, +1.60%  shares fell 8.3%. In addition to announcing the departure of Riccitiello, the videogame publisher late Monday said its fourth-quarter results are likely to come in on the low end of its forecast. Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR, +1.16%  shares declined 5.3% after Goldman Sachs downgraded the networking gear maker’s stock to sell from neutral.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — Another batch of earnings reports did little to shake the health-care sector from joining in on the broader market rally Thursday, though two notable firms stumbled thanks to some jittery investors. Varian Medical Systems Inc. VAR, +0.92%  was off more than 4% to $71.71 in recent action in the wake of the company’s earnings first-quarter report issued late Wednesday. Varian was virtually in line with expectations on most counts, but a concern over a drop-off in its oncology business put a chill on its shares. How DNA Can Be Used to Store Data The maker of various medical devices used to treat cancer said that while revenue for its oncology products was up 8%, orders were off 2% from a year ago, dropping 4% in markets outside North America. “Oncology customers took delivery during the quarter as expected but order placements were slower than anticipated,” Dow Wilson, the company’s chief executive said in a prepared statement. “We believe the order slowness is principally a timing issue and that the market fundamentals remain sound.” Varian said net income for the quarter was $95.3 million, or 86 cents a share, compared with $90.2 million, or 79 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. Sales were $678.4 million against last year’s $625.3 million. Analysts polled by FactSet had expected earnings of 87 cents a share on sales of $676.7 million. In a note to clients, Lazard Capital Markets analyst Sean Lavin said the drop in oncology orders was unexpected, as he predicted a 2.9% gain and the consensus was for a 6.7% increase. “With shares at an all-time high, they may slide some, but the fundamentals of the business remain intact and our estimates and company valuation move very little,” Lavin said. Meanwhile, recording first-quarter earnings that were slightly higher than expected didn’t seem to help drug distribution giant AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  , as shares dipped by nearly 2% to $45.43. Investors got a bit skittish, however, when the company missed revenue projections. AmerisourceBergen said net income for the period was $168.6 million, or 71 cents a share, compared with $162.1 million, or 62 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. Sales were $21.47 billion against last year’s $20.36 million. The company’s adjusted earnings of 69 cents a share were two cents ahead of the FactSet estimate, but revenue was off slightly from the $21.67 million expected.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — The major portions of President Barack Obama’s health-care overhaul bill won’t take effect until 2014, but in the coming year the medical industry will start to prepare for the onslaught of new policyholders scheduled to hit the system in little more than 12 months. As the bill — formally known as the Affordable Care Act and popularly referred to as Obamacare — starts to kick in, investors should watch a number of stocks that could either sink or soar. MarketWatch Week Ahead: Merry Christmas Cliff The fortunes of insurers, care givers, device makers, drug distributors, pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms rest largely on which sector they occupy in the health-care spectrum. If they sink, chances are others in their sector will suffer as well unless mitigating factors help keep their shares humming. The same goes for Obamacare winners; all boats in a particular sector are likely to be lifted if the rash of new policies smiles on them. Analysts agree the biggest winners in Obamacare will be hospitals, followed by insurers and drug distributors/pharmacy benefit managers. Medical-device makers, on the other hand, could suffer as a new tax imposed on them under the law threatens to eat into their bottom line. As more companies in the system become acclimated to the law, they likely will cut down on the use of health consultants and services groups. Provisions of the law that affect drug makers and biotech labs already, for the most part, have been enacted — including taxes on some drugs coupled with higher reimbursements. Going forward, these two sectors should see a largely neutral effect, though there could be a net gain for some companies, analysts say. MARKETS | • The Tell: Market news and analysis • | Canada section • Columns: Stocks | Oil | Gold | Bonds | Dollar  TOOLS AND DATA | • My Portfolio: Know where your funds are? • Real-time currency exchange rates • After-hours stock screener But there are exceptions too. There are some medical-device makers which could cut a swath based on demand for their products. And some hospital companies could see their windfalls limited in states that opt out of Obamacare’s Medicaid expansion program. One caveat: as with most legislative mandates, they can always be pushed back. Les Funtleyder, president of the investment advisory division at Poliwogg, a health-care investment specialist, says he wonders if states will be able to set up health-insurance exchanges by October 2013, or whether they’ll have to be delayed. The exchanges are a critical cog in the new system, as they are expected to be used to add millions of new policyholders to insurers’ rolls. “I think we’re going to have this conversation in the middle of 2014 and early 2015,” Funtleyder said. Here’s a list of five prospective winners, once Obamacare is implemented: 1. HCA Holdings Inc. HCA, -0.15% : The largest hospital operator in the nation, HCA is in prime position to reap the rewards of Obamacare. As more individuals become insured, hospitals stand to wipe billions of dollars in bad debt off their books that they have incurred for years by treating uncovered indigent patients in their emergency rooms. For some hospitals, it amounts to as much as 20% of revenue. “That should drop significantly by covering the uninsured as long as states go along with the Medicaid provisions,” said Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli & Co. Due to its sheer size, HCA stands to gain more than most but it also is setting itself up to take advantage. The company operates 263 hospitals and surgery centers in 20 states. It also recently announced a secondary offering of shares, as a number of private investors are liquidating their stake in the company which has traversed in and out of the public market. One note of caution, though. HCA has significant holdings in Texas, which has opted not to take part in the law’s Medicaid expansions. Seventy HCA facilities are listed in Texas. But Jonas says most states are likely accept the provisions. “It’s essentially free money for the first few years,” he said.

ABC,"Obama has been re-elected; “Obamacare” is the law of the land. It doesn't matter if you agree or disagree with Obamacare, you might as well generate big profits from it. Obamacare has been profitable for us. We bought Amerigroup Corp. US:AGP at $22.05, and, as of this writing, the stock is at $91.44 — this is a whopping 315% return. It wasn't long ago when we aggressively bought Tenet Healthcare THC, +1.76% at $20.40. Yesterday THC hit a 52-week high of $27.60. Here are 26 ways to profit from both the long and the short side. Hospital stocks The best way to profit on the long side from Obamacare is to buy hospital stocks as utilization rates will increase and uncollected receivables will go down. Under Obamacare, the pool of paying patients will increase. It is estimated that currently about 30 million Americans are uninsured. The increase in the number of paying patients will be huge. By law, hospitals have to serve all patients who show up at their emergency rooms including indigents as well as those with no insurance. Hospitals also have difficulty collecting from low income Americans who may have no insurance or are underinsured. Some hospitals aren't able to collect as much as 30% of their billings. The earnings of some hospitals may increase by as much as 25%. Our favorite stock in this sector is THC. Other hospital stocks on our list buy are Community Health Systems CYH, -3.65% HCA Holdings HCA, -0.15% LifePoint Hospitals LPNT, -1.67% and Universal Health Services UHS, -2.45% Medicaid HMOs These HMOs focus on Medicaid and other government programs and will be big beneficiaries of Obamacare. We own AGP but it is not suitable for those not in the stock. AGP is being bought by WellPoint US:WLP Other names on our buy list are Centene Corp. CNC, +6.50% Molina Healthcare MOH, +2.64% and WellCare Health Plans WCG, +1.77% Medicare Part D Medicare Part D is a private plan which provides prescription drug coverage for those eligible for Medicare. Government payments received by insurance companies for this program are likely to see reductions. Humana HUM, +0.48% is our top pick to short sell, but we will wait for this stock to meet all of our six screens before acting. Branded pharmaceuticals In the long run, branded pharmaceuticals will be hurt. Obama will be under intense pressure to reduce rising health care costs in Medicaid and Medicare. Branded drugs are a sitting duck simply because Big Pharma sells them for far less abroad than in the United States. Large-cap pharmaceutical stocks are in favor these days. The market participants perceive them as safe. The reasoning goes that people will always be using drugs irrespective of what happens in Europe, China or to the U.S. economy. It doesn't hurt that these stocks also pay high dividends. Buying high dividend stocks is the rage. However Bush tax cuts expire at the end of this year; if there is no compromise in Washington, income-tax rate on dividends will jump and high dividend stocks will give up some of their recent gains. Secret to making money by short selling is to sell short stocks that are popular and whose fundamentals are likely to deteriorate. We are short Market Vectors Pharmaceutical ETF PPH, +0.96% We have recently taken profits on Lilly LLY, +0.47% but we plan to short it again. Two other stocks to short on our list are Merck MRK, -1.13% and Pfizer PFE, +0.54% Generic pharmaceuticals In the short run, Obamacare is positive for generic pharmaceutical companies such as Teva TEVA, +0.29% Mylan MYL, +1.65% and Dr. Reddy’s Labs RDY, -0.30% In the long run, these companies will suffer as there will be intense pressure on the prices they can charge. There is an opportunity here on the long side in the medium term, but it will become a short opportunity in due course. Medical devices Obamacare levies a tax on medical devices. Further pressure on medical device companies such as Medtronic MDT, +2.24% Stryker SYK, +1.87% St. Jude Medical US:STJ and Zimmer Holdings US:ZMH to reduce prices will increase. . We plan to short sell these companies when they meet our six screens. Testing laboratories There will be more medical tests as more patients are insured. In the short run, implementation of Obamacare is positive for testing companies such as Quest Diagnostics DGX, +0.79% and Laboratory Corp. of America LH, +0.14% In the long run, Obamacare is very negative for these companies because they will come under heavy pressure to reduce rates. These are some of the best ways to profit from the short side in the long-term. Drug distributors As more pharmaceuticals are used, the ruling is positive for drug distributors such as McKesson MCK, +0.15% Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94% and AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29% Obamacare will prove to be a gold mine for astute traders and investors on the long side and the short side. The key to making money will be the timing of entries and exits using a proven method such as ZYX Change Method. If you cannot short, consider the inverse ETF RXD, +0.26% Disclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report are long THC, AGP and RXD, and short PPH; further we plan to initiate positions in the names in this column as they meet our six screens.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — A slew of earnings reports had largely positive effects on a broad array of health-care stocks Thursday, though a triple-digit market rally didn’t hurt matters much. As the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  gained a percentage point to 13,232.62, various health-care indexes moved up anywhere from slightly less than half a point to more than 2%. The day’s trading produced a few strange results as the rally seemed to lift all boats, regardless of earnings performance. Perhaps the most notable example of this was HCA Holdings Inc. HCA, -0.15% the hospital giant that reported growth in earnings and sales but missed analyst forecasts on both counts. Investors, however, were buoyed by the company’s growth and pushed shares a penny past the $30 threshold at the close, a gain of more than 5%. Weidner: NYSE Was Correct in Closing for Two Days The company said third-quarter net income came to $360 million, or 78 cents a share, compared with $61 million, or 11 cents, earned in the same period a year ago. Revenue for the Nashville, Tenn.-based hospital operator was $8.06 billion against last year’s $7.26 billion. On an adjusted basis, HCA’s earnings would have been 77 cents a share. Analysts polled by FactSet had predicted earnings of 79 cents a share on sales of $8.07 billion, on average. Meanwhile, drug-distribution behemoth AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  managed to get the same benefit, rising nearly 4% to $40.90 despite missing on earnings and sales for the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30. The company said net income was $163.5 million, or 67 cents a share, on sales of $19.45 billion, compared with income of $147.3 million, or 55 cents a share, on sales of $20.35 billion for the same period a year ago. With adjusted earnings of 65 cents a share for the period, that fell short of FactSet estimates of 68 cents a share; the company was expected to ring in $20.2 billion in revenue as well. But in its earnings release, AmerisourceBergen said it plans to shed its AndersonBrecon pharmaceutical packaging business in order to focus more on other operations. The Valley Forge, Pa.-based company also pegged its earnings target for fiscal 2013 and said its board declared a dividend increase and approved a new $750 million authorization for stock repurchases.

CI, -0.34%  ended up with a boost somewhere between that of HCA and AmerisourceBergen, though the insurance giant reported better-than-expected earnings and sales. Cigna credited an increase in policyholders and premiums during its third quarter. Cigna said net income was $466 million, or $1.61 a share, compared with $183 million, or 67 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. Sales for the period were $7.39 billion against last year’s $5.46 billion. Adjusted income was $1.69 a share. The FactSet-compiled consensus estimates called for earnings of $1.36 a share on sales of $7.34 billion. Cigna’s shares traded up 4.5% to $53.27. Read more on Cigna. But one company that didn’t get any break from investors Thursday was Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.54% part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. The drugmaker said third-quarter sales fell 16%, and dipped below estimates, as a number of its exclusive patents expired, including its popular cholesterol drug Lipitor. Lipitor revenue, for one, plunged by 71% worldwide from the third quarter of 2011. The company reported double-digit percentage losses in 18 other drugs from last year. Pfizer reported net income of $3.21 billion, or 43 cents a share, compared with the $3.74 billion, or 48 cents a share, for the 2011 quarter. Quarterly sales generated by the New York-based company were $13.98 billion against last year’s $16.61 billion. Adjusted income was 53 cents a share, a penny ahead of FactSet’s consensus estimates, but sales fell short of the $14.7 billion forecast. Shares fell 1.3% to $24.55 at the close. Read more on Pfizer. Another drug maker, Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. US:WPI  , found the earnings environment a little more hospitable, as its shares were up 2% to $87.71. The company said net income was $76.7 million, or 60 cents a share, for the third quarter compared with $68.1 million, or 54 cents a share, for the same period a year ago. Sales were $1.29 billion against last year’s $1.08 billion. Adjusted earnings were $1.35 a share, 7 cents ahead of analyst forecasts. Sales were expected to come in at $1.27 billion. Three other smaller health-care firms saw their shares surge after reporting earnings, led by Gentiva Health Services Inc. US:GTIV  , a provider of home health care and hospice services. Gentiva shares jumped by more than 21% to $11.36 after the company said adjusted third-quarter income was 4 cents ahead of estimates. Gentiva’s revenue was a little light of forecasts at $424.4 million, but the company raised its fiscal 2012 outlook to a range of $1.20 to $1.30 a share. That’s up from its previous forecast of $1 to $1.20 a share. Catamaran Corp. US:CTRX  , a pharmacy benefit manager, jumped by nearly 9% to $51.20 after the company adjusted third-quarter income was a penny ahead of estimates. But Catamaran bumped up its fiscal outlook to a range of $1.09 to $1.13 in adjusted earnings per share, up from $1.07 to $1.09 a share. And Mednax Inc. MD, +0.34%  gained more than 6% to $73.41 after the company beat estimates by 4 cents in adjusted earnings per share.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp.'s ABC, +1.29% fiscal fourth-quarter profit rose 11% as the drug wholesaler's lower input costs masked weaker pharmaceutical-distribution revenue. AmerisourceBergen boosted its dividend by 62%, to 21 cents a share, with the increase costing the company about $19.7 million a quarter. The company also approved a new $750 million share-buyback program, which will be added to another authorization with $97 million remaining, bringing the total to $847 million. According to FactSet, AmerisourceBergen's market value is about $9.93 billion. The company also said it is pursuing the sale of AndersonBrecon, its contract pharmaceutical-packaging business, so that it can focus on its distribution, specialty and manufacturer services businesses. The company has solicited buyers and is currently reviewing initial bids for the business. Income from AndersonBrecon represented four cents of the total $2.80 in per-share earnings for fiscal-year 2012. AmerisourceBergen is likely to benefit from the continuing introductions of big generic drugs this year, which tend to carry higher margins. It has also expanded its reach outside the U.S. with a string of acquisitions, including its $520 million purchase of World Courier Group, which closed in April. In July, the company picked up a high-volume deal with Express Scripts Holding Co. (ESRX) to distribute about $18.5 billion in medication each year. AmerisourceBergen came under federal scrutiny in August, when prosecutors and federal agents issued two subpoenas to the company related to its procedures for monitoring the distribution of narcotic painkillers and other controlled medications. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, AmerisourceBergen reported a profit of $163.5 million, or 66 cents a share, up from $147.3 million, or 54 cents a share, a year earlier. Earnings from continuing operations rose to 65 cents from 53 cents. Revenue fell 4.4% to $19.45 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters most recently projected earnings of 68 cents a share on revenue of $20.21 billion. Gross margin widened to 3.7% from 3%, as input costs fell 5.1%. The pharmaceutical-distribution segment's revenue fell about 6% to $19.1 billion. For 2013, the company said it expects per-share earnings from continuing operations of $3.06 to $3.16. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters recently projected earnings of $3.14 a share. Shares closed Wednesday at $39.44 and were inactive premarket. The stock is up 6.1% so far this year.

ABC,"Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94% said Wednesday that the government is seeking information in a process that could lead to civil fines following a recent settlement over allegations the drug wholesaler didn't do enough to stop misuse of prescription painkillers from a Florida distribution hub. The Dublin, Ohio, company reached the settlement with the Drug Enforcement Administration in mid-May over the Lakeland, Fla., center. Cardinal agreed to a two-year suspension of its license to ship controlled substances from that facility and also agreed to improve its procedures. Cardinal didn't pay a fine in May, but the deal ""did not foreclose the possibility of the U.S. Department of Justice seeking civil fines for historical conduct covered by the settlement agreement,"" Cardinal said in a regulatory filing Wednesday. ""In that regard, we are responding to civil subpoenas from two local offices within the DEA and the U.S. Department of Justice related to our distribution of controlled substances,"" the company said. Cardinal also said it is not yet possible to ""reasonably estimate a range of possible loss."" The government has been closely scrutinizing the nation's pharmacy-supply chain, including drug wholesalers and retail pharmacies, amid a soaring problem with prescription painkiller abuse. In 2008, Cardinal was blocked from shipping out controlled substances at three facilities due to DEA allegations the company wasn't doing enough to spot illegitimate purchases. Cardinal eventually paid a $34 million settlement payment but did not admit any wrongdoing. ISI Group analyst Ross Muken noted that the 2008 fine ""related to a much broader suit than they may face today,"" and he sees ""minimal financial impact"" if Cardinal winds up paying a fine. The company also noted in Wednesday's filing that the DEA confirmed, as part of May's settlement, that it wasn't planning further administrative actions at any other Cardinal facilities based on conduct prior to the settlement. Cardinal competitor AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% disclosed earlier this month that it received subpoenas from the U.S. Attorney's Office in New Jersey and the DEA seeking documents on the company's internal controls. In 2007 the DEA suspended all controlled-substance shipments for several months at an AmerisourceBergen facility in Orlando, Fla., until the company installed a more-robust order-monitoring program.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — Amid a broad Wall Street selloff, shares of Cigna Corp. climbed Thursday as second-quarter earnings exceeded forecasts and the health insurer raised its outlook for the rest of the year. Cigna CI, -0.34%  said net income eased to $380 million, or $1.31 a share, down from the $391 million, or $1.43 a share, reported a year ago. Revenue reached $7.46 billion in the latest quarter against the prior year’s $5.51 billion. On an adjusted basis, earnings would have come to $1.49 a share, or 7 cents ahead of the consensus projection among analysts polled by FactSet Research. Quarterly sales also had been projected at $7.22 billion, on average. Fitness Buddy, iFitness Pro review The company said it expects full-year adjusted income in a range of $5.25 to $5.60 a share, up from its previous estimate of $5.20 to $5.55 a share. The FactSet-derived consensus had been for $5.51 a share. Shares of Cigna traded up 4% to $41.86 by session’s end, bucking the broader bearish trend gripping U.S. stocks Thursday. Cigna doesn’t appear to be facing the same headwinds that other insurers reported during the quarter, analysts said. This earnings season has buffeted the shares of many managed-care providers due to higher utilization rates, along with uncertainty over federal spending trends. “Given the multiple earnings reports that have highlighted increasing macro challenges (sharper uptick in outpatient, broadly higher utilization in Medicare Advantage, etc.), we were pleased to see that [Cigna] doesn’t seem to be encountering trends they haven’t expected in their pricing assumptions,” wrote Jefferies & Co. analyst David Windley in a note to clients.

Also Thursday, shares of drug distributor Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94%  slipped nearly 4% to $40.89, as investors shrugged off a strong earnings report.

Cardinal reported net income of $236 million, or 68 cents a share, up 17% from the $203 million, or 58 cents, earned in the final three months of fiscal 2011. Sales generated by the Dublin, Ohio-based company were $26.76 billion, all but unchanged from a year ago. The company’s adjusted earnings of 73 cents a share came in a penny ahead of the FactSet-compiled consensus. Meanwhile, shares of SurModics Inc. SRDX, -0.39%  soared by 14% to $17.53. The medical products company beat analyst estimates on earnings for the third quarter ended June 30, and revised higher both its revenue and income outlook for fiscal 2012.

Sales were $14 million against last year’s $13 million. Adjusted earnings would have been 18 cents a share, ahead of the 14-cent consensus from analysts polled by FactSet. The company also raised its full-year revenue estimate to a range of $51 million to $52 million, up from $47 million to $51 million previously.

ABC,"The Supreme Court has just upheld most of President Obama’s health care overhaul. There is excellent coverage of the ruling by Russ Britt and Robert Schroeder in their piece Supreme Court upholds health-care overhaul. Here is how I think investors can profit from the ruling. Hospital Stocks The best way to profit on the long side is to buy hospital stocks. By law, hospitals have to serve all patients who show up at their emergency rooms, including indigent patients, as well as those with no insurance. Hospitals also have difficulty collecting from low-income Americans who may have no insurance or are under-insured. Some hospitals are not able to collect as much as 30% of their billings. As a result of the new law, the pool of paying patients will increase. It is estimated that currently about 30 million Americans are uninsured. The increase in the number of paying patients will be huge. The earnings of some hospitals may increase by as much as 25%. Hospital stocks to consider are Tenet Healthcare THC, +1.76% Community Health Systems CYH, -3.65% HCA Holdings HCA, -0.15% LifePoint Hospitals LPNT, -1.67% and Universal Health Services UHS, -2.45% Under the ZYX Change Method a buy signal is issued when all six screens are met. All of the hospital stocks mentioned here are currently meeting five to six screens. Commercial HMOs The changes are a mixed blessing for commercial HMOs. On the one hand, they will get more patients. On the other hand, there will be more competition as insurance exchanges under the law are implemented. The exchanges will make it easier for consumers to shop and compare insurance. The law will also allow individuals to easily become parts of groups and get lower rates. From a valuation perspective, stocks such as WellPoint WLP Aetna AET, -0.25% Cigna CI, -0.34% Humana HUM, +0.48% and UnitedHealth Group UNH, -2.06% are inexpensive deserve serious consideration on any dip from here. All of the HMO stocks mentioned here are currently meeting four to five screens of the ZYX Change Method. Medicaid HMOs These HMOs focus on Medicaid and other government programs. The Supreme Court has ruled that states can opt out of Medicaid expansion. According to the Supreme Court, if a state accepts the expansion funds, it has to obey the new rules. However, a state can refuse to participate in the expansion and still not lose all of its Medicaid funds. At this time, there is no way to know how various states will respond. If most states accept expansion funds, the biggest opportunity will be in Medicaid HMOs. The names include Amerigroup AGP Centene CNC, +6.50% Molina Healthcare MOH, +2.64% and WellCare Health Plans WCG, +1.77% Temporarily, we are suspending our ratings on these stocks. We simply need more time to analyze the Supreme Court ruling. However we have advised subscribers to hold AGP. AGP is a long-term position in ZYX Buy Change Alert being held long from an average price of $22.05. Currently, 55% of the full core position size is held. Partial profits have been taken as high as $74.60. Branded Pharmaceuticals In our analysis the Supreme Court ruling is neutral for pharmaceutical stocks such as Merck MRK, -1.13% Pfizer PFE, +0.54% and Eli Lilly LLY, +0.47% in the short-term, but negative in the long-term. Long-term investors may consider establishing short positions in pharmaceutical stocks on any big up moves. These are one of the best ways to profit from the short side in the long-term. Generic Pharmaceuticals In the short run, the ruling is positive for generic pharmaceutical companies such as Teva Pharmaceuticals TEVA, +0.29% Mylan MYL, +1.65% and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratory RDY, -0.30% In the long run, these companies will suffer as there will be intense pressure on the prices they can charge. Medical Devices The new law levies a tax on medical devices. In the short run, the ruling is negative for medical device companies such as Medtronic MDT, +2.24% Stryker SYK, +1.87% St. Jude Medical STJ, -0.32% and Zimmer Holdings ZMH Opportunities abound in specialty device companies that are on the cutting edge. Examples are Intuitive Surgical ISRG, +2.59% and MAKO Surgical MAKO Testing Laboratories There will be more medical tests as more patients are insured. In the short run, implementation of the law is positive for testing companies such as Quest Diagnostics DGX, +0.79% and Laboratory Corp. of America LH, +0.14% In the long run, the law is very negative for these companies because they will come under heavy pressure to reduce rates. These are one of the best ways to profit from the short side in the long-term.

ABC,"AmerisourceBergen Corp.'s ABC, +1.29% fiscal second-quarter earnings fell 1.1% as severance and acquisition costs masked the drug wholesaler's revenue growth. AmerisourceBergen had reported improved profits in recent quarters on the strong performance of its generic drugs and specialty pharmaceuticals. The company will likely benefit from continuing introductions of big generic drugs this year, which tend to carry higher margins, and a streak of acquisitions that have expanded its reach outside the U.S. AmerisourceBergen also agreed last month to pay $520 million in cash for World Courier Group Inc., whose focus is helping pharmaceutical companies test complex treatments. For the quarter ended March 31, AmerisourceBergen reported a profit of $212.1 million, down from $214.4 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, earnings rose to 81 cents from 77 cents, due to a reduction in shares outstanding. The most-recent quarter included $6.1 million of employee severance costs and $2.9 million of acquisition costs. Revenue increased 1.6% to $20.1 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had most recently forecast earnings of 81 cents on revenue of $20.05 billion. Gross margin slipped to 3.46% from 3.48%. Revenue at its drug business was relatively flat, while specialty group revenue grew about 6%. The company also backed its full-year guidance.

Terms call for Watson to make an upfront payment of 4.25 billion euros, with additional consideration contingent on Actavis achieving certain 2012 performance targets. The contingent payment, if fully earned, would result in the delivery of up to 5.5 million common shares of Parsippany, N.J.-based Watson during 2013. Watson also said it expects that the combined company’s “substantial” free cash flow will enable debt to be paid down quickly.

Along with reporting lower profit and revenue for the fourth quarter ended March 31, Xilinx Inc. XLNX, +1.25%  issued an upbeat revenue forecast for the first quarter of fiscal 2013. The San Jose, Calif.-based chipmaker said it expects revenue to increase 1% to 5% on a sequential basis, implying a range of roughly $564.6 million to $587 million.

ABC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Corporate earnings will command the attention of investors in the coming week with about one-third of the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reporting quarterly results. “We’re looking at the big industrials for indicators of global growth,” said Mark Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott. Economic data in the past week have indicated a cooling off in the manufacturing sector as the Federal Reserve said March industrial production levels were unchanged from February, and manufacturing gauges in the New York and Philadelphia regions declined. Also, slowing growth in China and a possible recession in Europe threaten to throw cold water on U.S. exports. MarketWatch Week Ahead: Apple and the Fed Among the big earnings reports beginning Tuesday are Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78%  along with Dow components AT&T Inc. T, +0.25%  , United Technologies Corp. UTX, +1.10%  , and 3M Co. MMM, +1.38% Other Dow DJIA, +1.07%  components reporting include Boeing Co. BA, +2.46%  and Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +1.53%  on Wednesday, Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +2.47%  on Thursday, with Chevron Corp. CVX, +1.73% Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.56% and Merck & Co. MRK, -1.13% wrapping up the week on Friday. Other high-profile earnings include Netflix Inc. NFLX, +3.35%  on Monday, and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.11%  on Thursday. Of the 106 companies on the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38%  that have reported earnings this season, 83% have reported earnings above consensus Wall Street estimates, according to John Butters, senior earnings analyst at FactSet Research. If that rate holds, it will be the highest upside surprise rate during earnings season in three years, Butters said. One nonearnings factor that may color the week is the first round of the French presidential election on Sunday, where front-runners Nicolas Sarkozy and challenger François Hollande are expected to go to a runoff election. “There may be a little spillover from France but it will be more of the same from earnings,” said Luschini. “The numbers have been exceeding by a sizable amount, so either management was good at keeping expectations low or analysts were too cautious.” Luschini said Tuesday and Wednesday will be busy days for economic data and Fed watching. On Tuesday, Case-Shiller home-price data come out, along with April consumer confidence data and March new-home sales. Then, on Wednesday comes durable-goods orders for March, and the Federal Open Market Committee announcement followed by a news conference from Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke. “Anybody and everybody will be trying to interpret where the Fed’s psyche is at the moment,” Luschini said. Financial stocks, which are the best performing sector with regards to earnings expectations this season, will continue to be a focus. Over the past week, the blended earnings growth rate in the S&P 500 improved to 2.2% from 1% in the previous week. That was fueled by a 12.8% blended earnings growth rate from financial firms, according to Butters. Now that the big banks have reported earnings, focus will turn to their regional counterparts, said Kevin Fitzsimmons, managing director of equity research at Sandler O’Neill. On Monday, Zions Bancorp ZION, +1.07%  and SunTrust Banks Inc. STI, +2.22%  report quarterly results. On Tuesday, Regions Financial Corp. RF, +1.64%  reports. That follows a week where Bank of America Corp. BAC, +2.04%  and Citigroup Inc. C, -1.11%  met or exceeded earnings. The previous week, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.82%  and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.81% surpassed Wall Street expectations. The sector has benefited from a reduction in credit costs and nonperforming assets as well as modest loan growth, and that comes when first-quarter seasonal costs such as payroll expenses are higher and improving margins remain an uphill battle, Fitzsimmons said. Still, even if strong earnings extend to this week’s regional banks, Fitzsimmons doesn’t expect a huge rally in the sector. “The group has had such a run over the last six months, we’re not seeing any dramatic stock moves,” Fitzsimmons said. Year-to-date, the Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF XLF, +1.36% which tracks the financial stocks in the S&P 500 Index, is up 17%; and the KBW Bank Index BKX, +1.30% which tracks the 24 leading U.S. banks, is up 21%.

Drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen made a number of acquisitions last year that bolstered the services it can offer its customers. Most recently, it acquired CVS Caremark Corp.'s (CVS) TheraCom LLC unit, which provides support services to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. World Courier, with projected 2012 revenue of about $500 million, is based in Stamford, Conn., and has over 137 offices, 13 storage depots and 2,500 employees in 52 countries. President and Chief Executive Steven H. Collis said the addition of World Courier's services ""provides an established platform for the introduction of our specialty services outside North America."" AmerisourceBergen expects to close the deal during the fiscal third quarter ending June 30, and it said the acquisition will be neutral to fiscal 2012 earnings and should add between 6 cents and 10 cents in fiscal 2013.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — Shares of AmerisourceBergen Corp. tumbled by nearly 4% Monday after the drug distribution giant’s chief financial officer resigned, prompting at least one analyst to downgrade the company’s shares. AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29%  dropped $1.39 to $37.21 at the close after Michael D. DiCandilo left unexpectedly to “pursue other interests,” according to a company press release. Markets Rise on Greek Debt News DiCandilo left after 21 years with the company and the last 10 as its CFO. Tim G. Guttman will now serve as acting CFO; he has been vice president and corporate controller since 2002. Read more about the CFO’s departure. The news prompted Robert W. Baird & Co. analyst Eric W. Coldwell to downgrade AmerisourceBergen shares to neutral from outperform. “We weren’t expecting this transition, and it comes on the heels of [AmerisourceBergen’s] first quarterly [earnings-per-share] miss in over four years,” Coldwell wrote in a note to clients. Coldwell put adjusted earnings for the company’s first fiscal quarter, which ended in December, at 62 cents a share, a penny below estimates. Coldwell also noted the CFO change comes after Chief Executive R. David Yost retired in July and was replaced by Steven H. Collis. “CFO leadership transition follows change at CEO position last July, and other headwinds; we’re moving to sidelines,” Coldwell wrote. The company also reaffirmed its own fiscal 2012 forecast of earnings between $2.74 and $2.84 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet Research expect earnings of $2.81 a share. The share drop kept AmerisourceBergen from taking part in a broader market rally, which extended to most parts of the health sector. The Chesterbrook, Pa.-based company’s two main rivals, McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  and Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94%  each posted gains — McKesson up slightly to $81.80 and Cardinal climbing 1.2% to $42.40.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — Shares of Edwards Lifesciences Corp. jumped nearly 6% Tuesday, sitting atop the S&P 500 index, as the coronary device maker reported positive test results from a new product. The Irvine, Calif.-based company’s shares traded up $4.40 to $82.67 at the close, after touching a session high at $83.96. Edwards EW, +2.01%  said that results from a trial of its Sapien transcatheter heart valve reduced the mortality rates in patients with the severe heart condition known as aortic stenosis. Lipitor Exclusivity Loss Knocks Pfizer's Earnings Stenosis is the blockage of the aortic valve that usually results in operative mortality on an average of 30 days. Using the Sapien device in a trial of 822 patients, Edwards said the mortality rate after 30 days was 8.2% and was 23.6% after one year. This is the second trial of the Sapien device; the first, with 104 patients, yielded mortality rates of 8.7% and 29.1%, respectively. Also Tuesday, shares of McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  climbed nearly 4%. Late Monday, the drug distribution giant reported adjusted income for the third quarter ended Dec. 31 that beat analyst expectations and announced it would repurchase another $650 million in stock. McKesson said net income for the quarter was $300 million, or $1.20 a share, on sales of $30.84 billion. In the same period during fiscal 2011, the company earned $155 million, or 60 cents a share, on sales of nearly $28.25 billion.

ABC,"Reuters SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Stock investors no longer have doubts about dividends, and that’s reason for some doubt. Shares of high-quality, cash-rich, large-cap companies that yield more than the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index SPX, +1.38% are the new favorites in many portfolios. But many of these success stories have been discovered, boosting share prices and trimming yields. INVESTING COMMENTARY IN TRADING DECK Back to 1987 for stocks? Our Trading Deck has been home to a spirited debate over whether we're in for a crash. • L.A. Little: Don't worry | Michael Gayed: Worry • The warning signs of a 1987-style crash • Hulbert: Stocks as overvalued as at 2007 high At this point, investors might do better scouring the S&P 500 for companies that wouldn’t show up on a screen for above-average yielders, but which still enjoy dominant, “wide moat” positions in their business. “It’s kind of a crowded trade,” said Paul Nolte, managing director at investment firm Dearborn Partners, about the popularity of the high-quality dividend strategy. “Valuations on high-dividend payers are at the upper-end of their historical ranges.” Indeed, money has cascaded into dividend-focused mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. Dow Jones Select Dividend Index Fund DVY, +1.04% for example, saw assets grow to around $10 billion from $6 billion a year earlier, according to the ETF Industry Association. Similarly robust asset growth was seen at Vanguard Dividend Appreciation VIG, +1.26%  and SPDR S&P Dividend SDY, +0.94% It’s easy to see why dividends are in demand. They’re an alternative to bonds’ paltry payouts, and cushion volatility. Plus, these stocks offer potential for capital appreciation. Without dividends, the S&P 500 was flat in 2011; including dividends the market returned 2.1%. The yield-rich Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  fared even better, up 5.5%. And the 10 highest-yielding Dow components, the so-called Dogs of the Dow, returned 12.2%. “Any time we see a big surge in the popularity of dividends in the market, that means prices have been marked up and it’s tough to find bargains,” said Josh Peters, editor of Morningstar’s DividendInvestor newsletter. Off the beaten path Owning financially healthy companies that reward shareholders with meaningful income is certainly still a viable investment idea. Large-cap stocks with little or no debt, that pay consistent dividends, and which grow those payouts over time, have been excellent decisions. And 3% or 4% in cash payments every year is nothing to ignore. Read more: How to elude the Fed's attack on savers. Last year, for example, the average S&P 500 dividend payer gained 1.4%, compared to the average 7.6% decline for non-payers, according to S&P. Performance was even better for S&P’s “Dividend Aristocrats” — companies with that have boosted payouts for at least 25 consecutive years, such as AT&T Inc. T, +0.25% Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% McDonald’s Corp. MCD, -1.28% and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, +0.56% Research S&P's Dividend Aristocrats. Many investors now are hoping such dividend magic will apply to Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78% which earlier this week reported blowout earnings. Apple’s chief financial officer said the company is considering ways to be proactive with a cash hoard approaching $100 billion. Read more: Apple's growth rate will not last. Apple isn’t paying a dividend, but if it did, the dividend world would spin. “If Apple came out with a policy that was going to give the stock a yield of 4%, you bet I would look at it,” said Morningstar’s Peters. Read more: Is Apple the cheapest growth stock? But investing in a company that might pay a dividend isn’t a solid approach; nor is buying the highest yield. Companies in financial trouble often sport unusually fat yields after the shares have taken a beating, and their ability to maintain the dividend is questionable. Near 0% Yields Ahead on Deposit Accounts? Better to focus on dividend-paying companies in robust financial health, and then consider how that quarterly payment could grow. The dividend might not be terrific now, but a well-run operation with a high return on investment is often the kind of company given to dividend hikes. And dividend investing is a long-term strategy; the goal is to “clip coupons” year after year. “Think in terms of what the yield could be, rather than what it is,” said Don Taylor, manager of Franklin Rising Dividends Fund FRDPX, +1.52% Ideally, these businesses boast a “wide moat,” meaning they stand apart from competitors because they invest shareholder capital wisely, minimize borrowing, grow revenue streams through smart expansion, and retain cash-generating assets such as patents or other intellectual property. It’s also crucial that dividend investors choose companies with plenty of cash to cover the dividend — derived from an earnings-based measure called the payout ratio. Nowadays, with companies banking cash as a buffer against economic uncertainty, the average payout ratio of S&P 500 members is under 30% of earnings, compared to a historical 52%, according to S&P. One upside to this stinginess is that companies have room to loosen their purse strings. Howard Silverblatt, the senior index analyst at S&P, estimates that 70% of the S&P 500 payers will boost their dividends this year. 10 for the money In searching for attractively priced, profitable companies that wouldn’t necessarily appear on a high-yield screen, MarketWatch enlisted the help of two researchers: Morningstar’s Peters and David Trainer, president of investment researcher New Constructs Inc. in Nashville. Morningstar’s analysis included wide moat companies with dividend yields below 2.1%, a cash surplus and no debt. New Constructs’ methodology, meanwhile, dug into financial statements to unearth companies with high excess return on invested capital, increasing economic earnings, low debt-to-total-capital, and high free-cash-flow yield (total cash flow divided by enterprise value). Strong stewardship of capital also suggests that management is acting in shareholders’ best interests. “You’ve got to have decent return on invested capital to afford a dividend,” Trainer said. “If you’re not making money, you can’t sustain a dividend very long.” Here are 10 wide-moat companies, culled from the two screens, that are debt-free and have a history of dividend increases: 1. Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, +1.94%  shows up on Trainer’s screen. The computer and mobile telephone chip-maker sports a a 2.1% yield — slightly more generous than the S&P 500. Its shares trade at a discount to Morningstar’s fair value estimate of $38. 2. Stryker Corp. SYK, +1.87%  makes both Morningstar’s and Trainer’s list. The orthopedic and medical equipment company recently yielded about 1.5%, with a low payout ratio of about 23%. The shares trade below Morningstar’s estimate of $63. Trainer’s screen also gives top marks to Stryker for profitability and valuation. 3. Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +1.30%  shows up on Morningstar’s screen for many of the same criteria as Stryker. The communications-technology leader yields about 1.5%, with a payout ratio of around 27%. Plus, the shares are discounted to Morningstar’s fair value of $62. Said Nolte: “Qualcomm is a cash machine.” 4. AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% makes Trainer’s screen for earnings strength and a cheap valuation. The pharmaceutical distributor’s shares yield about 1.3%, the dividend is growing, and the stock price is below Morningstar’s $45 fair value. 5. Cisco Systems CSCO, +2.95%  recently began paying a dividend, and the shares yield about 1.2%. The technology bellwether’s payout ratio is a low 15%, leaving plenty of room for potential dividend growth, and the stock trades at a healthy discount to Morningstar’s fair value of $26 a share. 6. Expeditors International of Washington Inc. EXPD, +2.73%  comes up on Morningstar’s screen. Recently the shares yielded 1.1%, with a payout ratio of 27%. Morningstar’s fair value on the shipping company’s stock is $61. 7. Franklin Resources Inc. BEN, +1.67% yields 1%, but the company’s 12% payout ratio and pristine balance sheet means there’s plenty of room to grow the dividend, or to continue special cash dividends that line shareholders’ pockets. Morningstar’s screen gives high marks to Franklin Resources on valuation, and the shares are priced far below Morningstar’s $137 estimate. The company is also one of the S&P 500’s Dividend Aristocrats. 8. Oracle Corp. ORCL, +1.71%  is another relatively new dividend payer. The shares yields 0.9%, while the company’s payout ratio is around 11%. The business software leader has a high return on invested capital, according to Trainer’s screen. Free-cash-flow yield and price-to-economic-book value are also attractive. Oracle also appears on the Morningstar screen based on valuation and profitability. Its shares trade at a steep discount to the researcher’s $41 fair value price. Going forward, Oracle could increase its dividend at a “better-than-normal clip,” Nolte said. “You’re getting 1% on your money, big deal, but if you’re compounding that at 10%, that starts to add up over years.” 9. Visa Inc. V, +2.25%  has a 15% payout ratio, according to Morningstar’s screen, even after a substantial dividend hike last year. The credit- and debit-card payment processor’s shares yield 0.9%, and trade slightly below Morningstar’s $105 fair value estimate. 10. National Oilwell Varco Inc. NOV, +2.45%  also is a new dividend payer that doesn’t provide much yield, recently 0.6%, but the drilling-rig equipment supplier has already increased its payout. The company still has plenty of available cash — the payout ratio is just 10% — and the shares are discounted to Morningstar’s fair value of $97. These types of top-drawer stocks combine value characteristics with growth potential. Said Nolte: “You have, from a total return perspective, the ability to grow principal in addition to growing income. And because you’re below the radar, you’re not in that crowded trade and have the opportunity to pick them up at better valuations.” More from MarketWatch This emerging-market ETF continues to blow away the competition Delta flight scare is a reminder never to put electronics in checked baggage Jobless claims drop 4,000 to 226,000 Related Topics Mutual Funds Investing U.S. Stocks Exchange Traded Funds","Jan 27, 2012 12:01 a.m. ET",1,10 income-paying stocks that beat the crowd,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/10-income-paying-stocks-that-beat-the-crowd-2012-01-27

ABC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Third-quarter financial results start to roll in next week, and there are a few things investors can do to help limit their exposure to earnings misses, analysts at RBC Capital Markets said Friday. Knowing what steps to take is particularly important, given that among all of the reporting seasons, the third quarter has “produced the deepest slide on average for companies that miss their earnings expectations” — down more than 4% within 10 days after their announcement, the firm’s analysts wrote in a research note. Are We Headed for a Double-Dip Recession? The latest quarterly reporting season faces extra challenges, with the benefit of a weak dollar “starting to roll off” and the “concentration of solid earnings growers” moving higher, according to RBC. Also, consensus earnings-per-share estimates only have been modestly reduced over the past three months. So look for stocks with modest earnings-growth expectations, low volatility in recent earnings-per-share growth and higher earnings transparency, the analysts said. Based on those factors, RBC provided a list of companies more likely to have a more challenging time in the upcoming reporting season, as well as companies with a higher probability of surpassing quarterly expectations. The analysts pointed out, however, that “both of these lists are intended as a starting point for investors looking into the earnings prospects of S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  companies; therefore, we suggest investors take a deeper dive into these names before making an investment decision.” The companies with a less favorable outlook heading into earnings, according to RBC Capital, include the following: COMPANY NAME & TICKER EXPECTED REPORTING DATE Schlumberger Ltd.

Shares were up 1.6% to $35.81 in premarket trading. Through Wednesday's close, the stock is up 3.3% this year, ahead of the broader market.

ABC,"Drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% will ""make every effort"" to extend its relationship with its biggest client, pharmacy-benefit manager Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS as Medco is acquired by one of its competitors, AmerisourceBergen's chief executive said Thursday. The drug wholesaler also anticipates it will be hard to meet its long-term goal of 15% per-share earnings growth in the upcoming fiscal year due to stronger-than-expected fiscal 2011 results that create tough comparisons, Chief Executive Steven Collis said on an earnings call. He said the company, which will release formal guidance in early November, could see 7% to 10% earnings per share growth in fiscal 2012. The current fiscal year runs through September. Chief Financial Officer Michael DiCandilo added that AmerisourceBergen is ""by no means"" reducing its earnings expectations in dollars. Instead, the company is far outpacing its original fiscal 2011 expectations with help from three specialty generic drugs. That performance will be hard to repeat, in part because AmerisourceBergen exhausted its supply of one drug that won't be available again for about a year. The company's shares recently traded down 2.1% to $38.18. On the Medco front, after Express Scripts Inc. ESRX, -0.93% announced plans last week to buy its pharmacy-benefit manager competitor for $29.1 billion, it raised questions about whether AmerisourceBergen could lose Medco as a customer when their current contract expires after March 2013. Drug wholesalers distribute both brand-name and generic drugs to health-care providers. Pharmacy-benefit managers, or PBMs, help employers and health-insurance companies administer prescription drug benefits, process claims and control costs by securing discounts from drug makers. Medco last year got nearly two-thirds of its drugs from AmerisourceBergen and represents about 18% of AmerisourceBergen's sales. But it only represents about 5% of earnings, Collis told analysts, due to factors like very competitive pricing. He also noted the companies' relationship centers around branded drugs, not generics. ""As a combination of the two PBM businesses evolves we will, of course, make every effort to extend our relationship well into the future,"" Collis said. AmerisourceBergen is not assuming it will lose Medco's business, believes it's done a great job serving Medco and expects ""to be considered very strongly"" going forward, Collis also said. AmerisourceBergen has ""a longstanding and excellent working relationship with Medco"" and a ""solid contract"" that will remain in place through its end date, the executive said. He added he does not believe the contract is subject to early termination as a result of the PBM consolidation. The Valley Forge, Pa., wholesaler reported early Thursday that fiscal third-quarter earnings rose 13%, topping analyst expectations, and it boosted its full-year earnings guidance while backing its revenue outlook.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — One thing seems clear — Wall Street loves the idea of pharmacy-benefit managers Express Scripts Inc. and Medco Health Solutions Inc. joining forces. Investors liked it so much that they not only rewarded Express ESRX, -0.93%  and Medco MHS  in Thursday trading, they also boosted the shares of what will become the companies’ chief rival in the sector, CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, -0.80%   Markets Hub: Markets Up on Euro News, Earnings Medco, which will be bought by Express for $29.1 billion in cash and stock, was up more than 14% at the close, climbing $8.05 a share to $63.83. Express was up 5.4% to $55.36. And CVS joined the party with a 2.4% gain to $37.82. Read more about Express Scripts’s deal to buy Medco. But there are reservations among investors, primarily over possible antitrust concerns. In pharmacy-benefit management, Medco, Express and CVS are the big three public companies and there have been calls recently for CVS to divest some of its holdings. Those concerns might not have been obvious, but they showed up in Medco’s stock price, which soared more than 24% as Thursday trading began but fell as the day wore on. The deal prices Medco shares at $71.36 a share, more than $7 a share higher than what investors were paying. “This timing no doubt takes into account what is likely to be a tough regulatory approval process,” Carol Levenson, analyst at Gimme Credit, said in a note to clients.

The “drag” on Medco’s stock also could be due to a key piece of business that the former unit of Merck & Co. Inc. MRK, -1.13%  is losing. Medco said it will not renew its pact with one of its largest customers, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06%  , which is likely to do the work that it was contracting Medco to do. Analysts, however, said that was expected. “We believe the stock was already pricing in a high probability of the contract being brought in-house by [UnitedHealth],” David Larsen of Leerink Swann said in a note to clients, “and while we view this as an incremental negative, we believe the bigger story is [the merger], which will overshadow both earnings and the [UnitedHealth] contract loss in our view.” One company that may lose Medco as a client is drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  The company’s shares fell 6% to $39.26 as it appeared it would lose Medco, its biggest client, as a result of the merger. Pharmacy-benefit managers like Medco and Express serve as the last conduit in the drug pipeline before medications reach the retail pharmacist. They not only bring medications from drug makers and drug distributors like Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94%  and McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  , they help process claims for the pharmacist. PBMs often exist within larger organizations; Merck and Medco formed a giant union before splitting in 2003. CVS also operates drug stores in addition to serving as a PBM. Walgreen Co. WAG  recently divested its PBM business and now, UnitedHealth appears ready to take on that function. Medco and Express, however, are probably one of the few in the sector that are nearly pure-play PBMs. Express now has 17% of the market while Medco has 14%. CVS has 21% and that has come under fire for anticompetitive practices by consumer groups. In April, five organizations, including Consumers Union and the Consumer Federation of America urged the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the company’s practices, saying the merger has “harmed consumers.” “By reducing choice, raising prices and violating patient privacy, the combination of CVS Caremark poses profound problems for consumers,” the groups said. Some analysts said, however, that the Medco-Express merger actually could bring down prices for consumers. The companies said in their press release announcing the deal that it should save costs by creating efficiency in the supply chain. “The cost and quality of health care is a great concern to all Americans; this is the right deal at the right time for the right reasons,” George Paz, Express’s chairman and chief executive, said in a written statement. “Companies like ours have a responsibility to provide the leadership and resources required to drive out waste in health care and provide the best care in the world.” More from MarketWatch Why tax refunds have lost their sparkle Jobless claims drop 4,000 to 226,000 Delta flight scare is a reminder never to put electronics in checked baggage Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets NY Stock Exchange NASDAQ","July 21, 2011 4:35 p.m. ET",1,Express-Medco shares lifted along with CVS,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/express-medco-shares-lifted-along-with-cvs-2011-07-21
ABC,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Drug wholesaler AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% faces the loss of a key customer as a result of Express Scripts Inc.'s ESRX, -0.93% deal to buy Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS, +0.00% for $29.1 billion. Medco is AmerisourceBergen's biggest client, representing 18% of the Valley Forge, Pa., company's revenue in 2010. No other customer accounted for more than 5%. While the Medco contract goes through March 31, 2013, its loss could cause a decline of 15 cents a share in AmerisourceBergen's per-share earnings, analysts say. A spokeswoman for AmerisourceBergen did not immediately return a request for comment. AmerisourceBergen shares recently fell 6.1% to $39.19, after declining as much as 11% Thursday. Earlier this month, the company's stock hit an all-time high of $43.47. ""Losing 18% of revenue calls earnings into question,"" said A.J. Rice, equity analyst at Susquehanna Financial Group, though he said the company can probably mitigate losses with cost cuts and share repurchases. Drug wholesalers distribute both brand-name and generic pharmaceuticals to healthcare providers. Medco last year got nearly two-thirds of its drugs from AmerisourceBergen. The planned merger presents a challenge to the three drug wholesalers, which includes Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94% and McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15% because it shrinks the number of pharmacy-benefit managers in the U.S., likely leading to price concessions from drug wholesalers as contracts are renewed. Cardinal Health, though, could benefit from AmerisourceBergen's possible loss, as it currently has a contract with Express Scripts that is set to expire in mid-2012. Corey Kerr, a Cardinal Health spokeswoman, declined to provide any specifics about the contract value. She also declined to comment on the Express Scripts and Medco deal. If Express Scripts moves the Medco business to Cardinal Health, Raymond James equity analyst John Ransom said in a note, it could potentially lift the drug wholesaler's earnings-per-share 5 cents to 10 cents, assuming that there is additional pricing pressure on the combined contract. But it is not a lock that Cardinal Health would be the winning bidder, even given its relationship with Express Scripts, he said. There also is the potential for Express Scripts to choose multiple distributors. ""All distributors would likely be active in bidding for this contract, with AmerisourceBergen's specialty capabilities providing a theoretical competitive edge,"" Ransom said. Shares of Cardinal Health rose 2.1% to $46.49 in recent trading, while McKesson shares gained 0.2% to $82.47.

The three firms collectively control more than 90% of the distribution market. In November 2008, McKesson agreed to pay out $350 million in claims, but other cases remain pending. “As a result of these discussions and the company’s periodic review of these claims, the litigation reserve has been increased by a pre-tax charge of $189 million,” the company said in a press release, adding that the charges are “without merit” and it plans to “vigorously” defend them.

At the close, Centene was off $1.63 to $22.81. It led a widespread selloff of health insurers for the day. The momentum from Centene apparently dragged Amerigroup Corp. AGP  shares down 3.8% to $41.32. WellPoint Inc. WLP  dropped 2.3% to $55.94 after the company’s shares were cut to hold from a buy rating. Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94%  had been up more than 5% on speculation of a possible takeover, but those gains subsided as the company tried to quash those rumors in a press statement released Tuesday. “While it is our longstanding practice not to respond to market rumors and speculation, we are making an exception in this limited situation.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — Shares of Immucor Inc. lost more than a fifth of their value at one point Thursday, plunging as the medical lab-equipment maker revised its financial forecast below analyst estimates. Immucor BLUD  said it now expects earnings for fiscal 2011 to come in at $1.08 to $1.18 a share, on sales of $320 million to $332 million. Analysts polled by FactSet Research had called for the company to have earned $1.24 a share by the time its fiscal year ends in May, on sales of $344.9 million. In recent action, Immucor shares traded down more than 18% to $16.64. At their weakest intraday level of $15.01, the shares touched a 52-week low. Immucor made the revised forecast as part of its first-quarter earnings report released after Wednesday’s close. The company said net income for the three months ended Aug. 31 was $21.4 million, or 30 cents a share, up modestly $21.3 million, or 30 cents, earned during the same period a year ago. Sales generated by the Norcross, Ga.-based company totaled $83.6 million compared with last year’s $83.1 million. The FactSet-derived consensus estimates for the quarter called for earnings of 30 cents a share on sales of $85.1 million. In a conference call with analysts Thursday morning, Chief Executive Gioacchino De Chirico said the company expects a 3% to 4% drop in industry volume. Immucor sells systems used to screen and process blood prior to transfusion. Market data indicate there will be lower blood demand than expected, De Chirico said. “While our fiscal 2010 financial performance was in line with expectations, there was a decline in the overall industry volume that was not evident in our numbers,” De Chirico said, according to transcripts of the call. “In fiscal 2010, we did not see the economic impact in our financial performance, primarily because of the substantial price contribution we had in 2010, the large number of instruments that went live and the delay in our customers adjusting their orders.” Also among health-care stocks, insurers made up for a lackluster showing on Wednesday.

ABC,"Corrects story to show that Blue Valley Ban Corp paid its first TARP dividend SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- The number of banks missing payments on the bailout money they got from the U.S. government has jumped and the Treasury Department is starting to get tough. Saigon National Bank may be among the first lenders to be affected, as the Treasury flexes its muscles. In August, 123 financial institutions missed dividend payments on securities they sold to the Treasury Department under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP. That’s up from 55 in November 2009, according to Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Of the 123, seven institutions have had a particularly tough time making TARP dividend payments. These are Anchor Bancorp Wisconsin ABC, +1.29%  , Blue Valley Ban Corp BVBC, -12.87%  , Seacoast Banking Corp. SBCF, -0.23%  , Lone Star Bank, OneUnited Bank, Saigon National Bank SAGN  and United American Bank UABK, -1.46%  , according to KBW. Saigon National is the only institution to have missed seven consecutive quarterly TARP dividend payments. The other six have missed six consecutive payments, KBW noted. Blue Valley paid its first TARP dividend in February 2009, but then missed the next six. The government used TARP to support the U.S. financial system at the height of the mortgage-fueled crisis in 2008, funneling billions of dollars into the country’s largest banks, including Bank of America BAC, +2.04%  , Citigroup C, -1.11%  , Wells Fargo WFC, +1.81%  , J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, +1.82%   Most of the big banks have repaid the TARP money they got and the Treasury has collected about $10 billion in dividend payments from the effort. However, the rising number of smaller banks that are struggling to meet dividend payments shows the program hasn’t been a complete success. Skipping six straight TARP dividend payments is an important threshold because Treasury gets the right to appoint two directors to the offending banks’ boards when that happens. Now Treasury is starting to exert this right. “We are exploring a number of options on how to properly exercise our contractual rights so to best protect the interests of taxpayers,” Treasury spokesman Mark Paustenbach wrote in an email to MarketWatch. “Once a director has been appointed, that information will be made public.” Treasury is focusing on banks where it invested more than $25 million. At first, it may send observers to board meetings to see whether new directors can help. Trade the FTSE 100 Reshuffle, Says HSBC At Saigon National Bank, which serves the Vietnamese business community in Southern California, this process has already begun. “They’ve asked for approval to appoint two observers to attend our board meetings,"" Roy Painter, chief financial officer of Saigon National, said in an interview. The observers haven’t turned up at any board meetings yet and Treasury hasn’t discussed any further details, including who the observers are, how they were picked and when they will start, Painter added. Painter also noted that Saigon National has been raising capital over the past year. He declined to comment further. If Treasury decides to appoint two directors to a bank’s board, it will hire an executive-search firm to track down the best candidates, according to a list of frequently asked questions that Paustenbach emailed to MarketWatch. These directors won’t be government employees. Compensation and expenses related to these new board members will be paid by the bank involved, according to the FAQ. Government-appointed directors won’t represent Treasury either. Instead, they will have the same fiduciary duties and obligations to shareholders of the bank that the other directors have, the FAQ said. The new directors also won’t be able to force banks to pay TARP dividends. “The board of directors, using its best business judgement, decides when and how to deploy the institution’s capital, including whether to make dividend (or interest) payments,” Treasury said in the FAQ document. Treasury has discussed its options with Anchor Bancorp Wisconsin, according to Chris Bauer, chief executive of the bank. “We’ve had dialog with them. They are in the process of determining what approach they will take. Nothing’s finalized yet,” he said in an interview. “We are ready to work with them and do the right thing -- they made a significant investment in the company,” Bauer added. “Our next board meeting is in October. They have to make a decision before that.” Still, Bauer warned that having government-appointed directors on the boards of TARP banks could create problems. If the Treasury’s investment in a bank is being analyzed by the board, there may be a conflict of interest if government-appointed directors are involved in the discussions, he explained. Such problems wouldn’t be as big if the government just sent observers to monitor board meetings, he added. “As a board member, you have legal and fiduciary responsibilities to shareholders,” Bauer said. “You could get into situations that are fairly complex.” More from MarketWatch My husband sold his grandmother’s house and paid off our mortgage — now his family is threatening to sue Trump boasts about making up facts about trade deficit to Trudeau This emerging-market ETF continues to blow away the competition","Sept 16, 2010 6:52 p.m. ET",1,Treasury getting tough on TARP deadbeats,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/treasury-getting-tough-on-tarp-deadbeats-2010-09-15
ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) — A series of notes indicating that conditions may be improving for U.S. “Big Three” pharmaceutical distributors led to sharp gains Wednesday. McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15%  , AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29%  and Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94%  saw their shares climb, with McKesson’s 5.4% rise to $62.98 leading the way. AmerisourceBergen tacked on more than 4% to $30.25 while Cardinal Health was up nearly 4% to $32.98 at the close. News Hub: Midnight Runners of Central Park Analysts had been noting that the three companies, which control more than 90% of the drug distribution network in the U.S., had been undervalued. But a report from Lazard Capital Markets analyst Tom Gallucci released Wednesday noted that recent data showed pharmaceutical sales took a turn higher in August. Gallucci quotes IMS Health, which noted that pharma sales were up 1.9% year-over-year, nearly double the rate of the second quarter’s average. He says new prescriptions were up 6.6% on an unadjusted basis. Gallucci said flu-vaccine sales will face difficult comparisons year-over-year, but noted that pharmaceutical distributors should confront less earnings pressure as their earnings are weighted toward generic medicines. MARKETS | • The Tell: Market news and analysis • | Canada section • Columns: Stocks | Oil | Gold | Bonds | Dollar  TOOLS AND DATA | • My Portfolio: Know where your funds are? • Real-time currency exchange rates • After-hours stock screener In an interview, Gallucci said it wasn’t just the IMS report that prompted the movement in stock prices. Sentiment had been declining throughout the health-care sector and may be on the rise, as price-to-earnings ratios for some had been as low as 10. “We’ve had horrible sentiment toward health care for a while,” Gallucci said. “We sort of said for the last several months that sentiment was worse than the fundamentals.” The analyst maintained his “buy” rating on McKesson and AmerisourceBergen shares, and a “hold” on Cardinal. He also noted that elsewhere in health care, most other sectors were up. Hospital shares rose with Lifepoint Hospitals Inc. LPNT, -1.67%  leading the way by leaping more than 10% to $36.69. A massive sale of options figured prominently Lifepoint’s move, according to a report from Dow Jones Newswires, but analysts were puzzled over the gain. Medical-device makers also rose, with Boston Scientific Corp.’s BSX, +2.40%  1.5% move to $5.41 leading the way. Insurers weren’t participating in the rally for the most part. WellPoint Inc.

The NYSE Healthcare Index was up 0.8% to 5,760.28 at the close. Tenet THC, +1.76% was up nearly 7% at one point early in the session, due largely to the company's depressed stock price.

CINCINNATI (MarketWatch) - With just over one week remaining in the second quarter, the Standard & Poor's 500 Index is struggling to escape major resistance. The specific area holds at the 200-day moving average, a level that's served as a magnet over the past five sessions. The S&P 500's SPX, +1.38% hourly chart details the past three weeks. As illustrated, the index tried to break higher on Monday, briefly rising on China's revised currency policy. Nonetheless, the rally was greeted with selling pressure, sending the S&P to close near session lows. From current levels, initial support spans from 1,105 to 1,111, bracketing the early-June peak and the 200-day moving average. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials' DJIA, +1.07% near-term view is similar. Like the S&P, the Dow briefly rallied at Monday's open, but reversed to close near session lows. Looking ahead, initial support holds around 10,430, and is followed by the Dow's 200-day moving average, currently 10,346. And the Nasdaq Composite's $COMPX near-term backdrop is the weakest. In fact, this was the only major benchmark to violate the early-June peak -- the 2,307 mark -- with Monday's reversal. From current levels, initial support holds at 2,289, and is followed by a deeper floor at the 2009 close of 2,269. Widening the view to six months adds color. As illustrated, the Nasdaq stalled just shy of its 50-day moving average on Monday, arguably contributing to its sharp reversal. Stepping back slightly, and taking in the entire chart, the May breakdown inflicted significant technical damage, and an extended basing period would normally be expected before the next sustainable upturn. Moving to the Dow, it topped just above its 50-day moving average on Monday before plunging 152 points into the close. On this wider view, initial support holds at the 2009 close of 10,428 and is followed by the 200-day moving average, currently 10,346. And the S&P 500's six-month backdrop is equally conflicted. In Monday's action, the S&P topped intraday at 1,131 -- just four points under its 50-day moving average -- and subsequently plunged straight back to its center of gravity at the 200-day moving average, in blue. The bigger picture As detailed above, each major U.S. benchmark challenged its 50-day moving average on Monday. Specifically: The S&P topped Monday at 1,131, just under its 50-day moving average of 1,135. The Dow topped at 10,594, slightly above its 50-day moving average of 10,573. The Nasdaq topped at 2,341, just under its 50-day moving average of 2,347. And upon reaching resistance, each benchmark reversed sharply to close near session lows. Bearish price action. Against this backdrop, the SPDR Trust S&P 500's SPY, +1.28% six-month view highlights familiar technical territory. Consider the following inflection points: Resistance at the S&P's 200-day moving average, currently 1,111. Resistance at the S&P's 50% market-crash retracement of 1,121. With these areas detailed, the S&P 500 remains uncannily trapped by this band. Specifically, the index closed last Tuesday at 1,115, Wednesday at 1,114, Thursday at 1,116, Friday at 1,117 and Monday at 1,113. So collectively, the S&P has cleared headline resistance at the 200-day moving average, a move that ""should"" have drawn market bulls off the sideline. But as always, it's not just what the markets do, it's also how they do it. And by this measure, the current recovery attempt has technical issues. To start, total volume remains lackluster, and recent strength has been driven by uninspiring sector leadership. And more technically, the S&P hasn't closed atop the 1,121 resistance. So all told, the S&P remains trapped by an unusually tight resistance band -- the 1,111-to-1,121 area -- and a guarded approach remains advisable until more convincing signs of stabilization emerge.

Aluminum sector rallies on China's revised currency policy Drilling down to sectors, the aluminum names perked up on China's revised currency policy: Alcoa, Inc. AA, +1.22% Aluminum Corporation of China ACH, +3.57% and Century Aluminum CENX, +2.10% Fundamentally, the currency adjustment signals confidence in China's economic recovery, also raising aluminum's cost of production in China to the benefit of worldwide producers. And from a technical standpoint, the group has responded accordingly. As illustrated, each has cleared a multi-month downtrend, and its 20-day moving average, signaling a near-term trend shift. Moreover, Monday's rally came on increased volume, improving the chances of a sustainable upturn. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold FCX $68.08 $67.00 $71.30 Similarly, Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold FCX, +4.90% is a large-cap name coming to life. With Monday's rally, the shares have spiked atop a three-month downtrend tracking the 20-day moving average. The breakout came on increased volume -- improving the chances of further gains -- and an uptrend is in play barring a violation of the 20-day. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC $32.42 $32.00 $33.25 Initially profiled May 13, AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% remains well positioned. Earlier this month, the shares broke to all-time highs, clearing resistance at the May peak. By comparison, the subsequent pullback has been orderly, placing the shares at an attractive entry near first support. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Tenaris SA TS $38.19 $37.30 $38.80 Tenaris SA TS, +3.31% is a large-cap manufacturer of steel pipe products. Technically speaking, the shares have sustained a break atop the 20-day moving average signaling a potential trend shift. Its backdrop would further strengthen on a close atop the late-May peak, around $38.80, a move that would mark a ""higher high,"" neutralizing the former downtrend. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance AK Steel Holding Corp. AKS $14.26 $13.75 $14.60 AK Steel Holding Corp. AKS, +5.84% is a mid-cap name showing signs of life. As illustrated, the shares are holding tightly to the 20-day moving average, raising the flag to a potential trend shift. Moreover, Monday's rally was driven by increased volume, improving the chances of a more decisive breakout. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Questcor Pharmaceuticals QCOR $10.89 $10.50 $11.60 Initially profiled May 24, Questcor Pharmaceuticals QCOR has returned 21% and remains well positioned. Earlier this month, the shares knifed to all-time highs on increased volume. Since then, it has sustained its gains, and while near-term extended, a pullback toward the breakout point, around $10.50, would mark a high risk/reward entry.

ABC,"ANNANDALE, Va. (MarketWatch) -- Though there are surprisingly strong statistical reasons for ""selling in May and going away,"" many nevertheless find it difficult to actually do what the strategy calls for -- sitting on one's hands from now until Halloween. It is especially hard to do now, in fact, with the bull market defying all odds and continuing to chug along. Money managers tell me that the worst crime that they can commit, at least in the eyes of many of their clients, is being out of the market when it is rising.   TRADING STRATEGIES: MAY Searching for great deals As the market climbs, good deals are harder to find. Let our panel of experts help you find value even in an arguably frothy market. • Kee: How to profit from May's market fall • Gilani: Stay and play the VIX in May • Lowell: Balancing shorts, bonds and coal • Kahn: Solar stocks show signs of life • Hulbert: Retail, leisure, food picks for summer • Cordier: Oil bull running out of gas • Lancz: Unlikely financials have merit • Murphy: Three biotech picks for May • Whalen: Short-term, low-yield bonds • Horowitz: May's value sectors • Auer: Money not easy, but still possible •   • See the full special report As a result, many choose to thumb their noses at the historical odds and stay in the market between May Day and Halloween. If you're just such an investor, this column is directed at you. It turns out that there are ways of increasing those otherwise poor odds. That at least was the finding of recent study that appeared last August in the Financial Review, an academic journal. Entitled ""The Halloween Effect in U.S. Sectors,"" the study was written by Ben Jacobsen and Nuttawat Visaltanachoti, both from New Zealand's Massey University. The researchers searched for seasonal tendencies among 49 different industries and 17 separate sectors in the U.S. stock market over the period from 1926 through 2005. They found a handful of sectors and industries whose returns in the summer were no worse than those in the winter. Provided you focus on stocks within those groups, therefore, and assuming the future is like the past, there is no reason the odds of success will be any worse this summer than they would be during the winter months. Which industries and sectors have the best odds of success between May Day and Halloween? According to this new study's authors, they fall broadly within the consumer-related sectors such as food and agriculture, leisure, multimedia and retailing. The winter months' best-performing industries, in contrast, are those in the manufacturing and production sectors, such as durables, chemicals, construction and machines. With this research in mind, I searched the Hulbert Financial Digest's database for highly recommended stocks that fall within the food and agriculture, leisure, multimedia and retailing sectors. To find such stocks, I started by identifying those advisers who had beaten a buy-and-hold in the stock market over the last 15 years -- a long enough period to identify those with genuine ability. Of the nearly 200 monitored advisers, 27 were able to jump over this high hurdle. I next determined which stocks in the favored industry sectors also are currently recommended by at least three of these 27 advisers. They are, in alphabetical order: AmerisourceBergen Corp.

ABC,"Air China first quarter profit $318 million (11:03 PM ET) HONG KONG (MarketWatch) -- Air China Ltd.'s(HK:753)(CN:601111) AIRY shares were up 1.1% in Friday morning Hong Kong trade, after the carrier said its net income for the first quarter more than doubled from a year earlier because of a rapid rebound in demand for air travel.

ABC,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Chuck Carlson, editor of the DRIP Investor newsletter, says that the economy is reverting to a ""two yards and a cloud of dust"" grind-it-out mentality, but that even with slower potential advances, some setbacks are still on the horizon. During an appearance on the ""Your Money with Chuck Jaffe"" podcast, Carlson said his firm is currently about 85% invested -- keeping some of its cash on the sidelines because it is waiting for another correction before being fully invested -- and that he likes the technology, health-care and consumers staples sectors. Carlson's newsletter is published by Horizon Investment Services, which also publishes the Dow Theory Forecasts newsletter, and which has its own proprietary stock analysis system. ""We have had confirmed new highs by the Dow Jones industrials DJIA, +1.07% and transportation averages saying that the primary trend in this market is bullish right now,"" Carlson said. ""But that doesn't preclude markets from pulling back,"" and possibly sooner than later, he added. Carlson said the passage of health-care legislation in Washington should help health-care stocks, which are in a sector that was looking promising without the new legislation. ""Markets don't like uncertainty,"" Carlson explained. ""If nothing else, whether you like the health care reform or not ... the uncertainty of whether it's actually going to happen has been reduced."" Listen to Carlson's views on tech, health care stocks. He added: ""It's interesting that people are fearful of health-care stocks when, in fact, there is going to be another $1 trillion dropped into health care over the next 10 years."" Carlson suggested Amerisource Bergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% and Hospira Inc. HSP, +0.18% as health-care stocks worth buying now. He also pointed out that one area that the Quadrix system does not currently like is big pharmaceutical companies, saying that brand-name stocks like Merck & Co. MRK, -1.13% and Pfizer PFE, +0.54% are actually stocks to sell or avoid right now.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Hospital and nursing home operators are sharply up while health insurers are mixed, with the nation's biggest carriers in the red. Is this what the House and President Barack Obama had in mind? Well, not exactly, and Monday's stock movements don't tell the whole story, analysts say. But they are an indication of what could be coming down the road in health care. The best indicator of how Sunday's vote by the House will affect the health-care industry probably could be seen in hospital stocks. The sector rallied strongly, and for good reason, says Dave Shove, analyst for BMO Capital Markets in New York. 'We view the event as being much more significant as a driver of investor sentiment.' Tom Gallucci, Lazard Capital Markets ""They may be one of the larger beneficiaries because the growth of the uninsured has really hammered them,"" Shove said. Indeed, hospitals in many cases have had to accept patients regardless of their ability to pay and it's a problem that has left many companies in shambles, such as Tenet Healthcare. THC, +1.76% Now, fueled by the prospect of $940 billion in government assistance to help pay for the care it will be giving, Tenet shares were up more than 9% at the close. Health Management Associates HMA rose even more, climbing 11.3%, as both it and Tenet have been trading below the $10 level for several years. A number of others in the group posted sizable gains and included acute care hospital operators Community Health Systems CYH, -3.65% LifePoint Hospitals Inc. LPNT, -1.67% and Universal Health Services Inc. UHS, -2.45% All three jumped by roughly 6%. Yet Lazard Capital Markets analyst Tom Gallucci is holding back on the euphoria. Gallucci said in a note to clients Monday that he is maintaining his buy rating on Community Health, as well as his hold designations on LifePoint, Health Management, Tenet and Universal Health. ""The legislation will result in a limited fundamental impact on our universe of coverage in the near to intermediate term, given that the bulk of the bill is implemented in 2014 [and] beyond,"" Gallucci wrote. ""As such, we view the event as being much more significant as a driver of investor sentiment."" Meanwhile, insurers seemed to be taking it on the chin, though that could be deceiving, says Shove. While UnitedHealth UNH, -2.06% HealthNet Inc. HNT, +0.00% and Humana Inc. HUM, +0.48% were all down Monday, those stocks and others had been enjoying solid gains in the days and weeks leading up to Sunday's vote. ""With all stocks, everything is relative to their valuations and what they've done recently,"" Shove said. He added that the industry is about to get a number of new patients as the bill promises to insure 32 million more Americans, but many of those will be unprofitable patients. ""In our point of view, we think that's a wash,"" Shove said. More negative Robert Zirkelbach, spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, says that's more of a negative, adding the industry is vehemently opposed to the bill. For one, the bill doesn't provide enough incentive for the uninsured to enroll in a plan right away because the penalties aren't stiff enough. In the first year, the tax penalty is $95, a tariff that many would be willing to pay against much higher priced health insurance. When the penalties rise to $750, that still may be cheaper than getting insured, he says. ""We have a health-care cost crisis in this country. And this is going to make it worse,"" Zirkelbach said. Others on Wall Street feel more assured, however, that whatever Congress plans to throw at insurers already has been thrown. The House's sidecar ""reconciliation"" bill has yet to be approved by the Senate, which could drastically alter it. ""However, we continue to believe money will rotate back into health-care stocks now that the uncertainty of 'reform' is lifted, boosting valuations longer-term, and the worst-case 'public plan' is off the table,"" Citigroup analyst Charles Boorady said in a note to clients. Help for tech As for other aspects of health care, medical technology faces a slightly smaller fee than expected, as that was reduced at the last minute in House negotiations, BMO's Shove said. And the reform legislation seems bound to help the fate of any firm in or around the pharmaceutical industry with drug benefits expected to stay the same or improve. Drug distributors such as Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94% McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15% and AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% were all up Monday. Similar gains were enjoyed by pharmacy benefit managers Medco Health Systems MHS and Express Scripts. ESRX, -0.93% Drugmakers enjoyed modest gains on Monday, with giants such as Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.54% and Eli Lilly & Co. LLY, +0.47% posting 1% gains. ""Pretty much everybody gets a pony, except for the taxpayers,"" said Les Funtleyder, analyst for Miller Tabak in New York, noting that those making more than $250,000 will have to help finance some of the reforms via higher taxes. Funtleyder says, however, that it won't be known for some time whether the legislation has been effective as many of the reforms come into effect in four years. Costs could well continue to soar. ""This doesn't do much about costs,"" he said. ""If costs continue to be unsustainable, we're going to have to come back and recast health care again.""

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Health insurers hung on to gains Wednesday after President Barack Obama exhorted lawmakers to move forward with a health care-reform plan that included tougher regulation of the nation's carriers. Meanwhile, a number of drug distributors lost ground after the speech, with many down more than 1%. Most major insurers had been up 1% or more ahead of the Obama speech but started losing ground afterward. WellCare WCG, +1.77% led the sector, climbing more than 4.5% after Stifel Nicolaus raised its rating on the company's shares to buy from hold. The company's stock has dropped in recent weeks on a lowered outlook, but an improved picture for Medicare and Medicaid programs has helped temper that. WellCare had been up more than 6% at one point. Amerigroup Inc. AGP still managed to retain gains of 1.4%, while Cigna Corp. CI, -0.34% and Aetna Inc. AET, -0.25% were both up close to1% . The nation's biggest carrier, UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06% was up 0.4% while top rival WellPoint Inc. WLP tacked on roughly 0.7%. HealthNet Inc. eked out gains of 0.9%, and Humana Inc. HUM, +0.48% ended the day unchanged. But Obama's proposals to eliminate ""wasteful"" subsidies of pharmaceutical companies took a bite out of drug distributors. Drug distribution giants McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15% and AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% dropped more than 1.5% while Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94% lost 1.1%. Pharmacy benefit manager Medco Health Solutions was off 1.4%. And hospitals and nursing facilities were mixed despite posting healthy gains earlier in the session. Kindred Healthcare Inc.

ABC,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Rich Moroney, editor of the Dow Theory Forecast and Upside newsletters, says that health care and consumer-discretionary stocks are on the rise, and that there are still good buys in technology, though the sector on the whole is slowing down. During an appearance on the ""Your Money with Chuck Jaffe"" podcast, Moroney said that health-care companies in general ""are scoring well"" on the proprietary Quadrix system that forms the basis for his newsletters' picks. ""Their momentum scores are holding up because they are more defensive companies that tend to perform well in recessions,"" he said. ""Their value scores are attractive because people are scared about the prospects for health-care reform."" Among the biotech stocks with the best scores right now, Moroney pointed out AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% Hospira Inc. HSP, +0.18% and Cantel Medical Corp. CMN During the ""Hold it or Fold it"" portion of the podcast -- where Jaffe's guests gives recommendations on stocks suggested by listeners -- Moroney also praised Stryker Corp. SYK, +1.87% Baxter International BAX, +1.86% Abbott Laboratories ABT, +1.16% and Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% suggesting that all have good prospects over both the short and long haul. On the consumer discretionary side, Moroney said that while it would seem surprising given the current economy to find retail companies with good prospects, it's the off-price sellers and discounters that have been rising to the top of the Quadrix system. He pointed out that Ross Stores ROST, +2.39% and TJX Cos. TJX, +1.08% are standouts in this area, and he also put a ""Buy"" recommendation on General Mills GIS, +1.60% in the consumer-staples sector. Among technology stocks, Moroney had buys on IBM Corp. IBM, +0.60% and BMC Software BMC, -2.86% and suggested in ""Hold It or Fold It"" that both Microsoft MSFT, +2.10% and Research in Motion RIMM are stocks with good long-term prospects, although he said he might prefer a slightly better purchase point rather than jumping in right now. Listen to why Moroney expects health-care stocks to lead the market. ""In a lot of sectors today, the values are in the higher-quality companies, the companies that have good track records have good operating momentum, have good financial strength,"" Moroney said. ""The stocks that have led since March have been the most speculative, most high-risk stocks. To some extent, that made sense; those were the companies priced for bankruptcy back in March. ""Now,"" he added, ""after nine months of months of outperformance by lower-quality high risk stocks, I think -- especially with the market acting a little bumpy here -- the appeal of a high-quality stock like IBM will become quite clear over the next nine months.""

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Having your industry under Congress' microscope can be a good thing. Just ask the 51 health-care companies in the Standard & Poor's 500. The stocks of 90% of these companies were within 10% of 52-week highs, while more than four-fifths are within 5% of that mark, as of Friday's close. And 28 of the companies, more than half, continued to touch new highs this week, all hitting a new closing threshold since Monday. While some of this remarkable performance is due to the overall S&P 500 index hitting its own new annual highs this week, analysts and reform advocates say the performance of these companies over the last few months can be partly attributed to the diluting of proposals for overhauling the nation's health-care system. Some of it also may be due to a market overreaction that occurred when Congress first started tackling the issue, says Les Funtleyder, health-care analyst for Miller Tabak & Co., and author of ""Healthcare Investing: Profiting From the New World of Pharma, Biotech and Health Care Services."" ""Reform won't be as bad as people think because people have a tendency to misprice risk,"" Funtleyder said. ""In this case, it got mispriced to the lower side."" The best performing companies that have reached new 52-week highs in the last few days include three of the nation's largest insurers, goliaths UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06% and Wellpoint Inc. WLP along with Humana Inc. HUM, +0.48% Wellpoint has broken past $66 after languishing in the mid-$40 range just three months ago. A similar pattern shows up in the chart of UnitedHealth, now heading toward $34 after dropping to around $24 in October. All six insurers in the S&P hit a rough patch at the same time in October as it was uncertain whether they faced the prospect of competing against the government to offer health insurance. Since then, they've all moved up. ""I would tell you that 90% of the share performance over the last [few] months has been due to the news that reform is not going to put these companies out of business,"" said David Shove, analyst for BMO Capital Markets. ""They were valued as if this business was going to go away."" Two of the other six, Cigna Corp. CI, -0.34% and Coventry Health Care Inc. CV.H, +0.00% hit 52-week closing highs this month and remain within 5% of those marks. The sixth, Aetna Inc. AET, -0.25% hit its 52-week high nearly a year ago and remains 9% below that mark. But Aetna has been making the same upward progress in the market as other insurers. The company suffered a setback when it reported earlier this week that it expects 2010 earnings to be below that of 2009, but it has rebounded and threatens to climb again. Does an improving stock market mean that health-reform legislation has lost its bite when it comes to regulation? U.S. Rep. John Garamendi, D-Calif., thinks so. ""What it's saying is a lot of folks are betting Congress will bring 30 million people into the insurance market without protections,"" said Garamendi, ""and without a proper regulatory environment."" Garamendi, formerly California's insurance commissioner and currently active in enacting health-care overhaul, criticized the Senate's version. He says the body developed a health-care bill without a public option and without proper safeguards for consumers. Others aren't so sure a watered-down Senate bill is the only reason for rising health-care firm fortunes. ""It's an easing of fear that health-care reform may not turn out as bad for them as they thought,"" Paul Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Changes, said. ""There certainly are positive aspects of reform for these companies."" Ginsburg said the ultimate fallout of the bill will be more drugs for companies to sell, and more patients being covered. Insurers, however, aren't the only health-care companies to reap big benefits over the last few months. A baker's dozen of medical device makers and pharmaceutical companies hit new highs this week, while seven others are within 5% of that level. Among the big winners are Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% Merck & Co. MRK, -1.13% Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.54% Medtronic Inc. MDT, +2.24% Millipore Corp. MIL, -3.92% and Stryker Corp. SYK, +1.87% Others are King Pharmaceuticals KG, +4.65% Watson Pharmaceuticals WPI, +0.00% Hospira Inc. HSP, +0.18% Varian Medical Systems Inc. VAR, +0.92% Thermo Fisher Scientific TMO, +0.26% Zimmer Holdings Corp. ZMH and Waters Corp. WAT, +0.04% The legislative effect on these stocks isn't as clear; in fact, medical device makers should be suffering if that were the case. Device makers face the prospect of an added tax on their revenue under current proposals. But device makers also haven't developed a large number of new products of late, says Miller Tabak's Funtleyder, and it still hasn't hurt them. ""The tax is certainly not a good thing for them,"" he said. ""But they're likely to sort of tread water."" For pharmaceuticals, the rise in that industry's fortunes may be more cyclical, says Douglas Christopher, analyst for Crowell, Weedon in Los Angeles. The industry has been out of favor with investors for some time now due to patent issues and a worrisome regulatory climate outside the overall health-care effort in Congress. Now, he says, fundamentals are beginning to point to more reasonable growth. The industry is valued a notch or two below where it should be, with price-to-earnings showing room for about 5% to 8% growth. Has the health-care overhaul movement had any effect? ""I guess it may have held it back from moving higher than it has,"" Christopher said. ""It's been a strong performer, despite that."" Other companies that have touched 52-week highs this week are, in the biotech sector, Biogen Idec Inc. BIIB, +0.74% and Life Technologies Corp. LIFE, -1.85% In health-care services, Davita Inc. DVA, -0.09% Lab Corp. of America LH, +0.14% and PerkinElmer Inc. PKI, +1.14% reached new plateaus. The only hospital firm in the S&P 500, Tenet Healthcare THC, +1.76% hit a new high while medical suppliers Patterson Cos. Inc. PDCO, -0.27% Baxter International Inc. BAX, +1.86% and Dentsply International Inc. XRAY, +0.72% did the same. Among pharmaceutical distributors, AmerisourceBergen Corp.

""We believe that the allegations are without merit, and we look forward to the opportunity to examine these matters with the states before the court,"" the company said in its own statement. ""Because this lawsuit is now in litigation, we are limited in our remarks about matters pending before the court,"" Amgen added, saying that it has a compliance program and code of conduct, ""and we expect that all of our employees follow it at all times."" Parties to the complaint include the states of California, Delaware, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Tennessee and Virginia, along with the District of Columbia. According to Amgen's Web site, Aranesp had worldwide sales of $3.14 billion in 2008. The product has had declining sales in recent quarters due largely to tighter reimbursement and prescribing restrictions. Shares of Amgen were down 1% at $53.62 during a decidedly bearish session for the broader market on Wall Street. AmerisourceBergen shares were down 2% at $22.19.

ABC,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- While not ""The Da Vinci Code,"" the obscure footnotes of a company's financial statements hold information that David Trainer swears will tell you if a stock is worth buying or selling. He has the record to prove it. Trainer, president of New Constructs, a Nashville-based independent research firm, uses an intensely bottom-up approach to analyze stocks. Each month, from the 3,000 stocks his staff dives into, New Constructs produces a list of the 25 most attractive and most dangerous. If you bought the 25 most attractive each month and sold short the 25 most dangerous dating back to April 2006, your long/short strategy would be up 63%. That doesn't just beat the market, it kills it -- topping the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index's SPX, +1.38% return over the same period by 86 percentage points. Trainer's research process and dedication to rooting out what he calls the ""truth"" about a company's numbers is why he is part of a series of columns I am writing focused on interviews with outstanding money managers. Straight and narrow Trainer's philosophy is straightforward: ""The economics of the business is what investors should care about, not the accounting,"" he said. ""Accounting rules were actually not designed for equity investors,"" Trainer added. ""They were designed for debt investors, so when you trust the financial statements on their face -- if you trust the net income number or you trust the cash flow statement number -- ... you are getting a very small piece of the overall picture with respect to the financial performance of the business."" Trainer digs to determine the economics of a business, looking for ""everything that helps you understand how much cash flow the company is generating based on how much cash flow was invested in the business."" He frequently finds that good companies are bad stocks, improperly valued with what New Constructs labels ""misleading earnings."" That's where a company cites rising profits in its accounting, while the underlying figures Trainer's research show that economic earnings in fact are moving in the other direction. Couple an inflated stock valuation with misleading earnings, and you have a stock that's a candidate for New Construct's ""most dangerous"" list. Of the stocks on that list for this month -- and you can get free downloads of lists that are three months old or older at www.newconstructs.com -- Trainer said Red Hat Inc. RHT, +2.26% may be the epitome of the kind of trouble stocks that his research weeds out. ""That's a company whose stock price implies that their profits will be 400% greater, and we show in our model that it would take them more than 100 years of profit growth to actually realize what is embedded into the value of the stock already,"" Trainer said. ""They show their accounting earnings rose by $2 million last year, even though we show that their economic earnings fell by $10 million."" Another dangerous stock is Sprint Nextel Corp. S, +0.41% which has been bouncing on and off the danger list for months, coming off whenever its price falls (so that its valuation improves). Now it's on the list. Said Trainer about the stock: ""The economics of the business have been horrendous for a long time, and the valuation is already pricing in profit growth for more than we can see -- our model says for more than 100 years, which just means forget about it, it's over the top -- and the economics of the business just don't support [uninterrupted profit growth for the next century]. Appealing prospects On the flip side, two stocks from the most-attractive list include Dish Network Corp. DISH, +1.20% and McDonald's Corp. MCD, -1.28% Dish has a valuation that ""implies that its profits are going to be 30% lower than they currently are ... forever, perpetually ... while we see that their profits are very strong and rising,"" Trainer said. McDonald's, he noted, is a stock with very low risk of being crushed by current market conditions. ""No growth expectation is baked into the stock price and we believe the competitive position and the economics are very strong,"" he said. ""If the market catches up to where we believe the profitability actually is, it could go up quite a bit."" Trainer's research isn't foolproof. His system sometimes produces a clunker or a stock that the market can sustain or depress despite all of the obvious signs. Part of the problem, Trainer said, is that corporations can hide a lot of information in footnotes and statements. ""In the last 10 years, corporations, auditors and Wall Street in many ways conspired together to try and make the financial statement, the accounting statement, do what they need [the numbers] to do, which is to help them sell stock,"" Trainer said. ""Just like any salesman, you're going to put your best foot forward always, you're going to focus on the positives instead of the negatives, and so the accounting statements are essentially a sales tool."" He added: ""We make it our goal in life to go through and gather all of the relevant financial information in all the statements ... The income statement, the balance sheet, the cash-flow statement, even the statement of shareholder's equity, where they are burying some important details with respect to preferred stock that they don't want you to see."" The research also can reveal industries where there are opportunities. The most attractive list favors energy and oil stocks and pharmaceuticals, including Chevron Corp. CVX, +1.73% Diamond Offshore Drilling DO, +2.95% and VAALCO Energy EGY, -1.87% on the energy side, and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +1.09% AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29% Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc. CBST and Questcor Pharmaceuticals Inc. QCOR on the biotech/pharma front. Yet neither industry is a slam dunk, Trainer said. The dangerous stocks list included Allscripts-Misys Healthcare Solutions MDRX, +0.73% and Northeast Utilities NU, -7.41% ""So much of the propaganda machine with respect to investing is trying to get you to start with a supposition [such as energy and pharma being hot industries],"" Trainer said. ""It's just not that simple.""

ABC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Given the surge that U.S. stocks have enjoyed, maybe mutual-fund investors should just call it a year. The market's performance over the last three months is closer to what you'd see in a runaway bullish 12-month period. Diversified U.S. stock funds rose 17.6% in the second quarter on average, according to preliminary results from investment researcher Morningstar Inc. The group is up a no-less impressive 7.1% in the first six months of 2009. In fact, while U.S. stocks lagged their international counterparts, every domestic stock-fund category that Morningstar tracks enjoyed double-digit quarterly gains, and all but real-estate focused funds are up for the year. See story on international stock-funds' quarterly results. But the rally since early March, while heartening, hinged on the good fortune of lower-quality, smaller-capitalization stocks. Such higher-risk holdings typically lead the market once it hits bottom, but they may not have much more juice left. ""Low-quality has panned out very well,"" said Paul Nolte, director of investments at money manager Hinsdale Associates. ""But going forward you're not going to get the economic expansion that's going to allow lower-quality companies to benefit. They're going to have to come up with real earnings and real growth."" That's easier said than done, with the U.S. economy still anemic. At this point in the cycle, the market should begin to favor larger, better-capitalized companies that can deliver the earnings growth investors seek. Yet even a rotation to higher-quality leadership will still leave investors far from whole: The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index SPX, +1.38% gained a robust 15.9% in the quarter, including reinvested dividends, but the benchmark needs to advance 60% in the next six months just to break even for the decade. Such a turbocharged performance would be extremely unlikely, to say the least. Instead, what U.S. investors could see, according to Standard & Poor's Inc., is a 10%-15% decline in stock prices followed by a rally that pushes the S&P 500 to about 955 by year-end. The index closed at 919 on June 30. ""I keep biting my nails, wondering when this correction is going to come,"" said Sam Stovall, S&P's chief investment strategist. ""We expect to see a correction over the next three months that will bring the S&P 500 down to between 800 and 850."" Sizing up funds For the past three months, however, small stocks were the big story. Small-cap funds gained 21.5% on average in the quarter, led by small value's 22.2% rise. Standouts included Aegis Value Fund AVALX, +1.74% up 48.5%, and Wasatch Micro Cap Value Fund WAMVX, +0.90% up 40%. Large- and midcap offerings followed with their own strong showings. Large-cap funds collectively added 16.2%, with large-blend and large-value each up 16.4% and large-growth up 15.6%. Among the top performers were the hardest-hit funds of 2008, such as Vanguard Capital Value Fund VCVLX, +1.01% up 39.1%, Yacktman Focused Fund YAFFX, +1.21% up 36.9%, Legg Mason Value Trust LMVTX, +1.40% gaining 29.4%, and Longleaf Partners Fund LLPFX, +1.04% rising 26.6%. Midcap funds averaged an 18.4% gain, with midcap-blend up 19.5%, midcap-value adding 18.9% and midcap-growth up 17%. Notables in these categories included a 41.9% gain for Kinetics Small Cap Opportunities Fund KSCOX, +0.91% and a 38.1% advance for Fidelity Leveraged Company Stock FLVCX, +1.93% The biggest U.S. stock funds, meanwhile, matched the market's faster pace -- and at times outran it. Dodge & Cox Stock Fund DODGX, +1.26% soared 23.1%, well ahead of the 16.4% average gain for its large-cap value peers. American Funds' Growth Fund of America AGTHX, +1.55% rose 16.7% and Fidelity Growth Company Fund FDGRX, +1.63% added 15.9% -- slightly better than their large-cap growth category's 15.6% return. Additionally, the S&P 500-tracking Vanguard 500 Index Fund VFINX, +1.38% and the exchange-traded S&P 500 SPDR ETF SPY, +1.28% both finished in line with the index, gaining around 16%. Worst to first The rally's lower-quality nature attracted bargain hunters and propelled last year's worst-performing sectors into the first tier. Real-estate funds led the pack with a 29.6% quarterly gain; financial-services funds were up 27% and natural resources offerings added 18.7%. ""We continue to be bullish on commodity companies, especially those that help get that commodity out of the ground,"" said Jerry Jordan, manager of Jordan Opportunity Fund JORDX a large-cap growth portfolio that gained 25.4% in the quarter. Natural-resources holdings in his fund include Schlumberger Ltd. SLB, +2.48% BHP Billiton Ltd. BHP, +2.16% and Diamond Offshore Drilling Inc. DO, +2.95% The quarter's other noteworthy sectors included technology and communications, each of which gained about 20% in the 13-week period. Both tech and telecom are attractive to Emmanuel Ferreira, manager of Oppenheimer Quest Opportunity Value Fund QVOPX, +0.11% a moderate-allocation fund that added about 8% in the quarter. Among his favorites: Take-Two Interactive Software, Inc. TTWO, +0.33% ; Research in Motion, Ltd. RIMM and Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +1.30% ""They're companies with interesting business characteristics that afford them tremendous earnings generation,"" Ferreira said. The weakest sectors were those that investors consider defensive -- health care, utilities -- but even those added 11% and 13%, respectively. And for managers who expect choppier trading days ahead, safer, dividend-paying stocks are better. ""Utilities have been bypassed in this low-quality rally,"" said Barry James, manager of James Balanced Golden Rainbow Fund GLRBX, +0.64% which gained 6.1% in the quarter. He includes a telecom in that group, Centurytel Inc. CTL, +1.36% which sports a 9% dividend yield. The health-care business is under pressure, but Chris Rowane, manager of Huntington Mid Corp America Fund HUMIX is avoiding mainstream pharmaceutical companies. Instead, he's concentrating on niche players such as Cephalon Inc. CEPH which is developing drugs to treat neurological disorders and cancer, and to manage pain. ""Higher-quality securities will benefit as investors look a little closer at companies,"" said Rowane, whose fund posted a 16.7% quarterly gain. ""We're looking at companies that have sustainable revenue growth as well as enhanced earnings."" 'New normal' The market's stellar advance in the quarter is signaling some investment professionals that the worst is over and, quite possibly, good times are set to roll again. Financial advisers' confidence in the U.S. economy and stocks hit its highest level in June since October 2007, according to Rydex|SGI Advisor Benchmarking, though the indicator is still squarely in ""neutral"" territory. Individual investors aren't so sure. For the year through June 24, a net $6 billion in new money had been invested in U.S. stock funds, according to the Investment Company Institute, an industry trade group. That's healthier than a year ago at this time, when investors had pulled a net $30 billion out of the stock market, but still weak. ""People realize the financial world is not going to come to an end,"" said David Kelly, chief market strategist for J.P. Morgan Funds. ""At the same time we're still in a nasty recession."" For investors, this transition will be challenging. Bill Gross, managing director at bond-fund giant Pimco and manager of its flagship Total Return Fund PTTAX, +0.10% (up about 13% in the quarter), has been speaking out lately about how to invest in what is being called the ""new normal"" -- a protracted period of stricter government regulation, tighter credit, slower economic growth, cautious consumers, rising longer-term bond yields and muted stock returns. Read about bond funds' quarterly performance. ""The 'new normal' will not be investor-friendly,"" Gross wrote in a recent commentary posted on Pimco's Web site. ""The outlook for risk assets -- stocks, high-yield bonds, and commercial and residential real estate will involve just that -- risk. Investors should stress secure income offered by bonds and stable, dividend-paying equities."" That said, individual investors shouldn't give up on asset diversification, but they'd do well to upgrade portfolios with higher-quality stocks -- large or small. ""Quality,"" in Wall Street parlance, is just another word for what really matters to investors, particularly in taxing times: Earnings. See related story on MarketWatch's 2009 investment ideas. ""Companies with stronger balance sheets, liquidity characteristics and consistent earnings growth will be better positioned to withstand any near-term volatility and take advantage of an eventual economic recovery,"" Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer Asset Management Inc., wrote in a recent research report. The Oppenheimer report highlighted several stocks that sport earnings growth and free-cash-flow greater than the S&P 500, but trade at cheaper price-earnings ratios. These include AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% Archer Daniels Midland Co. ADM, +1.33% CenturyTel Inc., Church & Dwight Co. CHD, +2.27% Omnicom Group Inc. OMC, +0.04% and United Technologies Corp. UTX, +1.10% Investors can review their mutual-funds' portfolios for high-quality bias, and find others with sturdy, stalwart holdings. As the year progresses, it's worth remembering an old Wall Street adage: When earnings growth is everywhere, the market prices it like water. When growth is scarce, the market prices it like diamonds.

Owens Corning posts profit, sees weak U.S. housing market (7:46 AM ET) NEW YORK (MarketWatch) - Owens Corning OC, -1.47% on Thursday reported third-quarter net income of $112 million, or 86 cents a share. On an adjusted basis, it earned 40 cents a share. Net sales fell to $1.27 billion from $1.39 billion. The Toledo, Ohio-based company, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, said third-quarter results reflected continued weakness of the U.S. new residential construction market, partially offset by stronger global markets in its composites business. As part of Owens Corning's annual operations planning, the company said it is evaluating various cost-reduction projects to deliver significant savings in operating and corporate costs. These projects include capacity and job cuts, elimination of operational costs, and reduced general corporate expenses. Some of these cost-reduction projects have begun, Owens Corning said. The majority of the projects are expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter, resulting in a leaner cost structure that better positions the company to compete in a weaker housing market in 2008. This cost-reduction initiative is intended to reduce company-wide operating costs by about $100 million. The company no longer believes that it will surpass its earlier EBIT guidance from continuing operations of $365 million. Based on the deeper and prolonged weakness in demand for building materials in the U.S., the company now believes $335 million is a more appropriate estimate for 2007 adjusted EBIT from continuing operations.

For 2008, Timberland is targeting mid-single digit first half revenue declines and improved operating results.

ABC,"A delay in changing the way Medicaid reimburses for generic drugs provides a reprieve for pharmacies, which nonetheless face a risk of lower payments as a result of the new method, according to Wall Street analysts. Pharmacy benefit managers should see little or no effect and drug distributors only secondary results from the new pricing model, while independent drug stores and at least one nursing home pharmacy appear more vulnerable to new reimbursement caps, known as federal upper limits. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services late Monday provided a timeline for switching to Average Manufacturer Prices, or AMP, for covering generic drugs in Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor and disabled. The new policy emerged from the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, which required a revised definition of the Average Manufacturer Price and a new formula for calculating federal reimbursement limits. Pharmacies will not be subject to the new caps until the end of this year, which is six months later than the government had previously indicated and an entire year later than lawmakers had originally contemplated, Morgan Stanley analyst David Veal said in a note. The new policy was mandated by the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. CMS expects to publish the final regulation on July 2. Drug makers are to report their September AMPs in late October, and retail pharmacies can expect that Medicaid reimbursement for generic drugs based on those prices to take effect on Dec. 30, CMS said. The delay not only preserves the current generics earnings stream, based on the more lucrative Average Wholesale Price model, for another six months, it also postpones adoption of the rules until closer to the time that many state legislatures reconvene, ""potentially allowing lawmakers to boost dispensing fees more immediately to offset the potential reimbursement cuts,"" Veal said. ""At a higher level, however, the delay merely postpones the inevitable changes that, depending on the content of the final regulations, may pose a risk to earnings for pharmacy operators that serve Medicaid beneficiaries,"" he said. Morgan Stanley believes nursing home pharmacy Omnicare Inc. OCR may be at the highest risk among stocks it covers, given that some of its Medicare prescription-drug-benefit contracts use Medicaid upper limits as a key benchmark. Drug distributors have indirect exposure through their independent-pharmacy customers, which serve a greater proportion of Medicaid patients than do chain drug stores, according to Veal. Morgan Stanley owns at least 1% of Omnicare shares and at least $1 million of its debt, and has a recent investment-banking relationship with the company. The firm also has ownership positions in and business relationships with other companies in the pharmaceutical supply chain. JPMorgan analyst Lisa Gill noted that the final regulation to be published soon will determine exactly what the AMP calculation includes. CMS published the proposed rule last December, and it remains to be seen what changes the agency may implement based on responses it received. ""Retail pharmacies are projected to bear brunt of the reimbursement impact,"" Gill said, noting that industry trade groups and others had expressed concern to CMS that lower reimbursement could threaten the survival of independent community pharmacies and to beneficiaries' access to medications. JPMorgan sees no direct threat to drug wholesalers or pharmacy benefit managers, although the wholesalers could feel an indirect hit if pharmacy reimbursement declines dramatically. CMS indicates it expects less than a 1% reduction in retail pharmacy revenue as a result of the new rule, Gill said in a note. The big three PBMs have virtually no exposure to the Medicaid market, although the publication of AMP pricing data could increase transparency around generics pricing. Commercial adoption of the pricing methodology is difficult to predict, as there is ""a significant degree of uncertainty around a new benchmark for PBM contracts,"" she said. The big three PBMs are Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS Express Scripts Inc. ESRX and CVS Caremark's Caremark business. The big wholesalers are AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC Cardinal Health Inc. CAH and McKesson Corp. MCK Eric Coldwell of Robert W. Baird noted that while he hasn't anticipated a material risk to drug distributors from AMP, it has been a sector risk given concerns about the effect on customer bases. ""While we cannot know the ultimate impact of the reimbursement change, at a minimum the clarified timeline suggests an additional six-month breather from what most observers expected,"" he wrote. Adam Fein, president of pharmaceutical supply-chain consulting firm Pembroke Consulting Inc., said on his weblog that in the next few years, the true effects of AMP will become clearer. ""List minus"" pricing models, such as Average Wholesale Price minus a certain percent, will ""continue to be under tremendous pressure"" among private payors, who have historically followed government pricing models, he said. ""Cost plus"" models help give payors better control over costs in the pharmacy supply chain, he wrote. Large drug store chains and mass merchants will benefit from accelerated consolidation of retail pharmacies, Fein predicted. The role and compensation paid to drug wholesalers may change as manufacturers pay closer attention to accounting of fees and discounts, he said. -Contact: 201-938-5400","June 19, 2007 4:30 p.m. ET",0,Pharmacies get reprieve on Medicaid drug-pricing change,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pharmacies-get-reprieve-on-medicaid-drug-pricing-change
ABC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - Shares of Medco Health Solutions Inc. set a fresh 52-week high Thursday after the company was awarded what analysts called a ""major win,"" a three-year contract to provide mail and specialty pharmacy benefits to government employees. The contract, which is expected to add some $2 billion in revenue and as much as 20 cents a share to Medco's results in 2008, prompted numerous analysts to raise their earnings forecasts and price targets. Raymond James analyst Michael Baker, citing enhanced 2008 earnings visibility and the potential for additional contract wins, lifted his rating to outperform from market perform. Shares of the pharmacy benefit manager MHS rose to trade for as much as $80.90 before closing the session at $78.24, up $1.15. The contract for The Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association's government-wide service benefit plan, also known as the Federal Employee Program, covers more than 4 million federal employees, retirees and their families, Franklin Lakes, N.J.-based Medco said. FEP renewed the retail side of the contract, estimated to be worth $4 billion annually, with CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, -0.80% Caremark has been administering FEP's retail pharmacy benefit management program since 1993; it took the mail portion away from Medco during the 2005 through 2007 period. ""FEP's move to split the contract between two vendors had been discussed in the market, but is a surprise nonetheless,"" noted Cowen & Co. analyst Kemp Dolliver. He doesn't expect other employers to follow suit. The contract goes into effect Jan. 1, 2008 and runs through the end of 2010. CIBC World Markets analyst Charles Rhyee further modeled the impact on Medco's drug distributor, AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% whose 2008 per-share earnings he expects will see an added 2 cents. Meanwhile, he expects McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15% the distributor for CVS' PBM operations, to be negatively impacted by about a penny a share. AmerisourceBergen shares slipped 3 cents to close at $51, while McKesson shares finished at $61.09, down 97 cents. CVS shares rose 32 cents to end at $37.57.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- They are known as the ""Big Three"" in the pharmaceutical wholesale industry, and their control over the market is drawing the attention of lawmakers, the scrutiny of regulators and the wrath of smaller rivals who say they've had enough. Behemoths Cardinal Health Inc. CAH, +0.94% McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15% and AmerisourceBergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% have a virtual lock on the wholesale drug market with at least 90% and as much as 95% of all revenue. Collectively, the trio is expected to hit the quarter-trillion-dollar mark this year in sales. The three companies now are in the enviable position of controlling sales to pharmacies and other outlets, as well as being drugmakers' biggest customers. Regulators are concerned that because the Big Three control both the sell and buy sides of the equation, they could form both a potential monopoly and oligopoly, in antitrust parlance. A monopoly puts market clout into the hands of one entity, and an oligopoly means heavy market power put in the hands of a select few. ""Ninety percent is a market that we would consider to be oligopolistic in nature,"" said Michael Moiseyev, assistant director for the Federal Trade Commission's bureau of competition. ""Ninety percent is a zone where further consolidation is problematic."" While these pharmaceutical middlemen have amassed massive sales and market clout, there is no indication they have violated any statutes, experts say. But by holding massive buying and selling power, they're making federal officials nervous -- again. And the companies' size and market control stands out all the more starkly against a backdrop of rising health-care costs. These companies have grown far faster than the FTC anticipated when the agency last visited them just a few years ago. In the late 1990s, the FTC said no to McKesson's plan to buy Amerisource and Cardinal's dreams of owning Bergen Brunswig. As a concession, the FTC allowed Amerisource and Bergen Brunswig to merge in 2001, and could live with the fact the three collectively controlled roughly 80% of all drug wholesaling. Since then, however, it appears that all three have continued to steamroll and virtually corner that market. Recent efforts to quash the reimportation of drugs probably have strengthened the position of the Big Three. Drug reimportation, designed to help consumers save money by getting pharmaceuticals overseas, likely would have cut into the sales of these wholesalers. But a Senate bill, passed last week, effectively prevented that from happening. ""I can't say whether the market is more competitive with the three of them,"" said Moiseyev, who worked the FTC's cases involving McKesson and Cardinal. Four out of five McKesson, Cardinal and Amerisource essentially have secured the wholesale drug market, and they're close to having a similar standing over all prescriptions sold in the U.S. Some retailers and other end-users have direct ties to manufacturers, but it is estimated four out of every five drugs sold in the nation pass through the hands of the Big Three. Various estimates on the Big Three's share of just the wholesale market alone hover around 90%, though some say it is up to 95% by now, much of it due to dozens of acquisitions. Those purchases continue at a brisk pace, though they're now branching out into other fields with more recent buyouts such as distribution of medical devices and services for drugmakers. How did they get so big? See related story on acquisitions by these companies. There are few significant pharmaceutical distributors left for them to buy. Amerisource did, however, announce on March 28 it is trying to complete a deal for one of the last remaining major regional wholesalers, Bellco Health. The ever-expanding market share of all three companies has competitors crying foul for a number of reasons. For one, rivals say, the Big Three's market share could grow even more under a rule that would require their smaller wholesalers to provide documentation of where a drug has been, known as ""pedigree."" Amerisource, Cardinal and McKesson would be exempt from that rule, putting smaller rivals at a disadvantage. Further, drugmakers prefer to deal with the Big Three. Small wholesalers who try to deal directly with major drugmakers often find themselves steered toward McKesson, Cardinal or Amerisource for product. That puts these smaller players in the unusual predicament of relying on their much larger rivals for their livelihood. Under normal circumstances, economies of scale would help keep prices down with the size that the Big Three offer. But they're increasingly dictating prices and terms. In nearly all cases, Cardinal, McKesson and Amerisource are mandating that customers buy large amounts of product in bulk. Since the Big Three have most of the access to the drugs, customers feel compelled to comply. Sal LaDuca, president of QK Healthcare, a small wholesaler based in Ronkonkoma, N.Y, says the Big Three's marketing clout manifests itself in numerous ways. For example, generic drugmakers often will sell to anyone, but the Big Three's access to popular brand drugs such as Viagra allows them to charge more for generic goods. ""They're able to demand that because they have these proprietary items,"" he said. ""That's their game."" In addition, wholesalers don't capture the same attention that producers or retailers get; they often are considered the unsexy conduit between the two. As a result, the Big Three have flown under the radar to a large extent, and so it's unclear how much of an effect they have on pricing. Anecdotal evidence suggests these wholesalers could add as much as 25% to the price of drugs. ""I've heard everything from a few percent to 20%, but I honestly don't know,"" said Fred Gebhardt, a writer who covers drug wholesalers for the trade magazine Drug Topics. ""I don't know if anybody even has the data to build a reasonable model for that kind of setup. Everybody agrees that you get higher prices from an oligopoly, but I don't know how much higher."" FTC probe Recent concerns have prompted the FTC to reopen the file on at least the two biggest players in this troika, McKesson and Cardinal. McKesson's most recent annual 10K, filed May 9 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, says the FTC has requested documents as ""part of a non-public investigation to determine whether the company may have engaged in anti-competitive practices with other wholesale pharmaceutical distributors in order to limit competition for provider customers seeking distribution services."" Last year's filing from Cardinal used virtually identical language to disclose its situation. Both companies have said the probe has been ongoing since December 2004, when they first were contacted by the FTC. Neither McKesson nor Cardinal would comment on the matter. It's unclear whether Amerisource is part of that same investigation. The company will only say it hasn't had any FTC requests that it feels it must disclose. And neither Moiseyev nor other FTC officials would comment directly on the probe, except to confirm McKesson's and Cardinal's statements, and to say their investigation hasn't been completed. While the FTC is investigating Cardinal and McKesson, it hasn't put the kibosh on any of their acquisition plans. Since late 2004, the two companies have taken part in nine acquisitions. And all three have made more than 100 acquisitions since 1980, with the bulk of them in the past 10 years. In one of its purchases, McKesson obtained an FTC waiver on a waiting period so it could buy wholesaler D&K Healthcare Resources Inc. in mid-2005, several months after the company disclosed the FTC probe. The deal was completed in little more than a month for $427 million. FTC officials had no comment on the D&K deal. Biggest in Fortune 500 The Big Three are dominant players by any corporate yardstick. From 2002 to 2005, they were the largest of all health-care companies in sales among the Fortune 500, all consistently ranking in the top 30. For 2006, McKesson and Cardinal remained the top two health-care firms, ranking 18th and 19th, respectively. Amerisource ranks 29th and is now the fourth-largest health-care firm in sales, having been eclipsed by insurer UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06% Similarly, UnitedHealth has grown tremendously in the past year due mostly to merger activity. During calendar 2006, McKesson, Cardinal and Amerisource generated $213 billion to $218 billion of drug sales in the U.S., which represents roughly 80% of all pharmaceuticals sold in the nation. IMS Health says total U.S. sales during that period were $275 billion, some of which went directly to retailers from pharmacies. (None of the Big Three report on a calendar-year basis. Their revenue is the sum of quarterly sales during calendar 2006, in order to measure that against the IMS total.) Thanks to a number of acquisitions, McKesson's fiscal 2007 revenue reached $93 billion, the company reported recently. Projections from Thomson Financial show that Cardinal's sales should hit $88.5 billion and Amerisource will reach $67 billion. Amerisource's income, however, will be augmented by another $2 billion with the company's planned Bellco buyout. With sales growth ranging from 6% to 10% for the Big Three, that comes out to a collective $250.8 billion in revenue this year. Provided those 2007 estimates ring true, the three companies' sales will have grown a collective 70% in the six years since the AmerisourceBergen merger was approved. Although the Big Three have captured massive market share, their bottom lines might seem weak. Gross margins were in the 3.5% to 6.5% range for the three, but net margins often amount to less than 1%. With added bulk, though, comes profit growth. For both 2007 and 2008, the Big Three are expected to hit gains near or past double digits in earnings. It's why size clearly matters for not only the Big Three, but also their buyers. Drugmakers prefer to deal in bulk, thus leading them to deal with Cardinal, Amerisource and McKesson. In turn, the Big Three often require minimum purchases themselves, a practice that's already driven up prices and choked off avenues of supply for a number of smaller users such as clinics, doctor's offices or small pharmacies. Drugless in Seattle Doug Beck works part time running a small pharmacy for Schick Shadel Hospital, a 26-bed substance-abuse treatment center in the Seattle area. Patients who come in may need antibiotics or blood-pressure medication, but demand is not high. The hospital handles about $2,000 a month in products. Beck used to get his medicines via McKesson, but he says the wholesaler cut him off because he wasn't ordering enough. He went down the street to a retailer, White Center Pharmacy, for what he needed and ended up paying 25% more for it. ""It was frustrating to me because [McKesson] delivers to White Center Pharmacy. They drive right by our facility, so it wasn't like it was any added cost for them,"" Beck said. ""And they needed a minimum of $10,000 a month to justify, I don't know, the guys picking it off the shelf or inventory control. I don't know what all it was. They didn't share that."" McKesson responded that such minimum-purchase agreements are part of the normal course of business for many distributors. Amerisource also commented on this issue, saying it requires a minimum order from its customers, and added: ""In order to serve our customers most efficiently and provide the best value, we prefer to serve our customers as the primary vendor."" Some observers of the wholesaling business say the Big Three got to where they are in some measure because of natural market forces. ""The three biggest wholesalers have a very compelling service package,"" said Adam Fein, president of Pembroke Consulting, a Philadelphia-based consultant that specializes in distribution and marketing. ""They've been very successful at what they've done, and customers -- whether it is pharmacies or hospitals -- have decided that's where they want to purchase their drugs."" But the Big Three's influence has grown to the point where drugmakers feel obligated to use them, said Drug Topics' Gebhardt. ""If you've got an aggressive wholesaler that's on, say, a regional basis, who's going out and trying to grab market share, it's going to hurt your established Big Three relationships,"" Gebhardt said. ""It's worth a lot to you, the manufacturer, to keep those Big Three national wholesalers happy."" Supply cut off And small wholesalers, who sometimes are the only means of getting products to small, independent pharmacies, can find themselves getting squeezed when they rely on competitors for business. Bob Drucker, president of wholesaler RxUSA in Port Washington, N.Y., says Big Pharma's reluctance to take on new distributors forced him to rely on the Big Three for product. That pipeline slowed to a trickle a couple of years ago before being shut off entirely last year. Now he's scrambling for product from other small wholesalers. Drucker says Cardinal and Amerisource stopped selling him product years ago. Up until last year, Drucker was using McKesson. When McKesson was sending him product, it was only a fraction of the orders he requested, he says. In 2005, he asked McKesson for $697.3 million worth of product that he planned to move, but says the wholesaler delivered only $172.2 million. That means Drucker didn't get to sell $525 million worth of pharmaceuticals, or 75% worth of his orders, leaving his customers and a number of patients scrambling. ""We did $295 million [in total sales]. We could have done $1 billion,"" Drucker said. ""The little guys who are independents are dying like flies."" For the first two months of 2006, Drucker got only 10% of the requested orders from McKesson before the wholesaler cut off his supply in anticipation of new provisions of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act going into effect. Those provisions were blocked by an injunction, but would have required that Drucker provide ""pedigree,"" which is essentially an individual itinerary on each drug that document where the product had been. McKesson reasoned that it would not be able to supply that information, Drucker said. RxUSA has filed a lawsuit against the Big Three and a number of pharmaceutical manufacturers, claiming they are monopolizing drug sales. Several defendants involved said they expect to prevail on motions calling for dismissal of the case. RxUSA also was the lead plaintiff in the litigation that prompted a federal judge last year to put a hold on the drug marketing rule. McKesson wouldn't respond directly, but said in court documents on Drucker's case that the lawsuit is flawed and the sheer number of companies named in the lawsuit -- 23 in all -- couldn't possibly form a monopoly. The company says drugmakers and large wholesalers are perfectly within their rights to not sell RxUSA any product. ""Further, no wholesaler defendant controls access to pharmaceuticals,"" McKesson's response says. ""The manufacturers of those products choose what drugs to make, to whom they wish to sell them, and in what quantities."" Many drugmakers would not comment for this story because they are named as defendants in Drucker's lawsuit. Those who would talk say it's too costly for them to maintain a vast network of distributors. They prefer to have just a handful of wholesalers dispensing their products. ""It's easier to deal with three people than 300 people,"" said Bryant Haskins, Pfizer PFE, +0.54% spokesman, who said the bulk of the company's business goes through the Big Three. ""We think we have a very effective system."" Pricing challenged A challenge of sorts is being mounted against the drug pricing system by retail behemoth Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +1.37% Wal-Mart is large enough to buy enough bulk shipments of certain types of generic drugs so that it can sell them at its stores for $4. But it's not the only retailer waging a fight against the current pricing system. Seattle-based BC Drugs, a small independent pharmacy, fills prescriptions on a cash-only basis, says co-owner George Butchko. BC doesn't take insurance, and thus is able to keep the price of drugs such as lisinopril, a popular blood-pressure medication, at $15 a month, roughly half of what is charged at other pharmacies. While many retailers get virtually all their product from one or all of the Big Three, BC relies on AmerisourceBergen for about two-thirds of its product and secondary wholesalers for the rest, Butchko says. Under the drug marketing act's requirement for ""pedigree"" - which primary wholesalers like Amerisource won't have to provide -- he feels many smaller wholesalers will go out of business and his prices will go up. ""I know that having so many different sources to order from, that I've seen in the year that I've been here, [AmerisourceBergen] prices drop because they really have to be competitive with the other wholesalers that we have,"" Butchko said.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Growth by acquisition has been the watchword of the ""Big Three"" of pharmaceutical distribution -- McKesson Corp., Cardinal Health Inc. and AmerisourceBergen Corp. This troika of middlemen have amassed a quarter-trillion dollars in sales, thanks in large part to more than 100 buyouts since 1980, at least 57 of which have taken place in this decade. There may be even more purchases, but they say a number go unreported. Cardinal Health CAH, +0.94% has been the busiest by far, with 65 purchases since 1980, nearly half of those since the beginning of 2000. Merger activity is so engrained in Cardinal's culture that the practice occupies its own page on the company's Web site. During 2000 and 2001, Cardinal averaged an acquisition once every six weeks. A key rival was taken out of commission in February 2001 when Cardinal acquired Bindley Western Industries, one of the bigger regional firms that rivaled the Big Three. McKesson's MCK, +0.15% merger activity hasn't been as prolific -- or so it appears. The company has reported 23 purchases since 1983, 16 of which took place since 2000. One of its biggest took place in January 1999, when it began to take shape with the purchase of HBO & Co., and then it bought D&K Healthcare Resource, another major regional wholesaler, in July 2005. But McKesson says there may be more. The company points out that it does not report any buyout it considers to be ""non-material."" While Amerisource's ABC, +1.29% purchases have been fewer, they've been more concentrated. In its present form and former incarnations, Amerisource and Bergen Brunswig, the company has made 15 purchases since 1999. All but two, however, have taken place since 2003. Most significant was its announcement in March it was buying Bellco Health, eliminating another major regional rival.

ABC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) - AmerisourceBergen Corp. closed down more than 7% Wednesday after the drug distributor posted a slight rise in second-quarter profit but said one of its facilities has been temporarily barred from distributing certain controlled substances and chemicals. Shares of AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29% fell $4.04, or 7.2%, to finish the session at $52.32. DEA action The Drug Enforcement Administration has temporarily suspended the license of AmerisourceBergen's distribution center in Orlando, Fla., related to DEA controlled substances and listed chemicals, claiming the company failed to prevent controlled substances, specifically the cough suppressant and painkiller hydrocodone, from reaching four Internet pharmacies from Jan. 1, 2006 through Jan. 31, 2007. Hydrocodone is sold under the brand names Vicodin and Lortab and its abuse, according to the DEA, has been escalating in recent years. AmerisourceBergen said it's not doing business with any of the four customers cited by the agency; all of them held active DEA licenses to sell controlled substances at the time AmerisourceBergen sold product to them, the company said. The suspension could affect some 1,400 customers in Florida, the company said late Tuesday. Alternative arrangements will be made for affected customers if the suspension isn't lifted soon. ""We do not expect this temporary suspension to have a material impact on earnings,"" Chief Executive David Yost said on a conference call. A.G. Edwards analyst Andrew Speller said that although consolidated operations won't be materially impacted, ""...we believe investors fear that the DEA may shut down other AmerisourceBergen facilities due to what is alleged to be ineffective controls against diversion of controlled substances,"" he wrote in a research note to clients. Quarterly numbers On Wednesday, Valley Forge, Pa.-based AmerisourceBergen posted net income of $129.5 million, or 68 cents a share, For the quarter ended March 31, up from $129 million, or 61 cents, earned in the second quarter of fiscal 2006. The year-earlier quarter's profit included a gain of 6 cents a share for various items. Quarterly revenue jumped to $16.51 billion, up from the prior year's $15.22 billion. Operating revenue was $15.28 billion, 9% higher than the nearly $14.1 billion in the year-ago quarter. Analysts, on average, had been anticipating that the drug wholesaler would turn in earnings of 67 cents a share on revenue of $16.7 billion, according to estimates compiled by Thomson Financial. Earnings in the company's PharMerica business lagged in the second quarter due to lower-than-expected performance in the PMSI workers' compensation business, which was attributed to increased competitive pressure on customer pricing. The PharMerica business consists of the PharMerica Long Term Care institutional pharmacy business, which is being spun off in combination with the comparable division at Kindred Healthcare Inc. KND, +0.00% to form a stand-alone institutional pharmacy, and PMSI, the workers' compensation business. ""AmerisourceBergen's gross margin was essentially flat year over year, which masked improvements for its core distribution business,"" Banc of America analyst Robert Willoughby said in a research note, taking his price target on the stock to $53 from $49. There were about 9% fewer average shares outstanding in the latest quarter than a year earlier, the company's results showed. Citing a gain related to an antitrust settlement, AmerisourceBergen also raised its fiscal 2007 forecast for net earnings to a range of $2.50 to $2.65 a share from $2.45 to $2.60 a share.

ABC,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- U.S. stocks closed with moderate losses Monday, pressured by investor wariness a day ahead of the Federal Reserve's monetary-policy decision and by a supply disruption at a BP-run oil field in Alaska that touched off a rally in crude futures. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% closed 20.97 points lower at 11,219.38.

""A turtle waddles around in the muck of all kinds of problems."" Investors are still adjusting to new Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and are uncertain how to read his signals. But many think the Fed will break Tuesday from the steady stream of quarter-percentage-point increases that have been put in place since June 2004. 'We're not in a bull market, and we're not in a bear market. We're in a turtle market.' Al Goldman, A.G. Edwards The overnight bank lending rate now stands at 5.25%. Although equities investors want to see a pause in rate hikes Tuesday, few are expecting the market to rally much if the central bank takes a break. Marc Pado, U.S. market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald, said a rate pause is already priced into stocks. A.G. Edwards' Goldman added that the market's focus after the Fed meeting is likely to shift to the U.S. economic slowdown, and particularly to the question, ""Are we in for a soft landing or a hard landing?"" He also said that recent data show economic cooling, but whether the slowing is significant or minor is open to debate. Alaskan chill News over the weekend of a BP pipeline shutdown in Prudhoe Bay sent crude futures rallying. ""This is a psychological negative,"" said Goldman. ""We've anticipated possible supply problems in the Middle East. But this is the U.S.A. Right now, the market is acting like it's easier to go down than up."" The shutdown is to deprive world markets of 400,000 barrels of oil a day. Escalating violence in the Middle East added to investors' worries. Overnight, Israeli forces took on Hezbollah fighters near the Mediterranean coast, while air strikes continued. There was little market reaction to news from the Federal Reserve that consumers took on a a bigger-than-expected $10.3 billion in new debt in June, the Federal Reserve said Monday, nearly double what they'd taken on in May.

ABC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- AmerisourceBergen Corp. and Kindred Healthcare Inc. said Monday they have agreed to combine their institutional pharmacy businesses into a separate public company that would become one of its industry's largest players. The tentative deal was viewed as positive on Wall Street, giving investors a way to see the value of Kindred's pharmacy division while allowing AmerisourceBergen to focus on its core distribution business. AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29% of Chesterbrook, Pa., and Kindred KND, +0.00% of Louisville, Ky., said they expect to sign a definitive agreement on or about Sept. 30, and complete the deal in the first quarter of 2007. Kindred's stock rallied 6.7% to close at $30.94, while shares of AmerisourceBergen added 1.1% to end the session at $43.18. Their newly created company would be second only to Omnicare Inc. OCR, +0.00% as the nation's top provider of drugs and prescription services to hospitals, nursing homes and other clients. Under the plan, PharMerica Long-Term Care and Kindred Pharmacy Services would be separated from their respective parent companies via tax-free spin-offs. The businesses would be combined in a stock swap, with each side owning 50% of the shares. The new company is expected to generate revenues of about $1.9 billion, with preliminary cost savings estimated at about $30 million. ""It's about providing the best of the best of what each company has,"" Dave Yost, chief executive of AmerisourceBergen, said in an interview. PharMerica and Kindred Pharmacy would each make a one-time cash distribution of $150 million to their respective parent companies. They would fund the distribution by borrowing $150 million each, giving the new company $300 million of new debt. With a customer base of 330,000 licensed beds in 41 states, earnings before interest and income taxes are forecasted at $75 million. Kindred CEO Paul Diaz said the new company would look to further grow the size of the new company both organically and through additional acquisitions. ""As we put together the capital structure, we have been careful to ensure there was lots of financial flexibility,"" Yost said, noting that such financial leverage would enable the company to seize on any acquisition opportunities. Stifel Nicolaus noted the combined company would act as a more significant national competitor for Omnicare, whose shares were off 1% in afternoon trade, at $46.12. ""However, investors should keep in mind the new company will only be about 30% of Omnicare's size in terms of pharmacy revenue,"" analyst Jerry Doctrow wrote in a morning note, ""and the strategy for the new pharmacy seems to endorse many of the advantages that Omnicare already has or is pursuing in terms of scale, repackaging/automation, increased technology and related services."" Morgan Stanley analyst David Veal said, in the near term, he expects few changes to the competitive landscape. It will take at least six months for the deal to close, he wrote in a note to investors. ""Second, we believe that fully realizing the scale benefits of the new company, which are in our view the linchpin for renewed strategic momentum, will take time."" The combination does not include AmerisourceBergen's workers' compensation business, which is reported in its PharMerica segment, nor Kindred's hospital, nursing center or contract rehabilitation businesses. The deal requires regulatory review by the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities and Exchange Commission, and a favorable determination by the Internal Revenue Service. The parties hired Heidrick & Struggles to conduct a national search for a chief executive officer and chief financial officer to lead the new public company, though Yost said ""talent from within"" would be considered for all phases of leadership. Deutsche Bank Securities is acting as financial adviser to AmerisourceBergen and Lehman Brothers is acting as Kindred's financial adviser.

ABC,"LONDON (MarketWatch) - U.S. stock market futures sagged on Monday, with a rally in crude-oil futures and nervousness ahead of a Federal Reserve interest rate decision weighing. S&P 500 futures dropped 4.70 points at 1,281.30 and Nasdaq 100 futures shed 6.25 points at 1,509.25. Dow industrial futures slumped 38 points to 11,240. Overseas, the Nikkei 225 tumbled 2.2% in Tokyo, and the German DAX 30 lost 1.6%. On Friday, markets couldn't hold early gains despite jobs data that raised hopes the Federal Reserve would pause its interest-rate hike agenda. For the week, the Dow industrials rose 0.2%, the S&P 500 rose 0.1% and the Nasdaq Composite gave up 0.4%. See Market Snapshot. Ahead of Tuesday's Fed decision, some traders may be focusing more on the 0.4% average hourly earnings growth than the lower-than-forecast 113,000 jobs growth. ""It may be the oil story that's exacerbating things, but people are sitting there thinking, 'Why on earth did the Bank of England lift interest rates? What if the Fed does the same,'"" said Tom Hougaard, market strategist for City Index, a U.K. spread betting firm. The Bank of England last week unexpectedly lifted its key interest rate. The European Central Bank did likewise, though the ECB hike was expected. Crude-oil futures soared over 2% on Monday before paring gains after BP BP, +2.37% started shutting down a key oil field representing 8% of daily U.S. production. BP is shutting down its Prudhoe Bay oil field in Alaska, taking some 400,000 barrels a day of crude oil off the world market, following the discovery of a corroded pipeline and a small leak. Crude for September delivery shot up $1.12 to $75.88 a barrel in morning electronic trading, after reaching a high of $76.67 earlier in the session.

The mine is majority owned by BHP Billiton BLT, +1.93% and 30% held by Rio Tinto RIO, +2.65% See metals story. Rio Tinto's U.S.-listed shares slid 1.7% to $207.88 on Inet. The U.S. dollar was relatively steady, edging up vs. both the euro and the Japanese yen. Hansen Natural Corp.

ABC,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Shares of AmerisourceBergen didn't benefit from better-than-expected earnings Wednesday as Wall Street wondered whether the pharmaceutical distributor's second-quarter performance was that solid. AmerisourceBergen ABC, +1.29% beat analyst estimates on both earnings and sales, but the company's earnings got the benefit of lower tax rates. Further troubling analysts was the performance at AmerisourceBergen's PharMerica division. One analyst, Lisa Gill of J.P. Morgan, lowered her rating to neutral from overweight. Shares of the company were down more than 7% in recent action. AmerisourceBergen said net income was $129 million, or 61 cents a share, up from $99.4 million, or 45 cents a share in the year-earlier period. The results include a benefit of 6 cents a share from special items. Without them the company would have reported earnings of 55 cents a share. Total revenue rose 15% to $15.22 billion from last year's $13.19 billion. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had been expecting earnings of 54 cents a share and revenue of $13.85 billion, on average. Further, the pharmaceutical services company raised its 2006 earnings estimate to $2.06 to $2.21 a share from $1.98 to $2.13, and its revenue growth forecast to 10% to 12% from 7% to 9%. That usually is enough to prompt a spike in shares, but some analysts were concerned there may not be much upside for the behemoth. ""We expect the improvement in pharmaceutical distribution operating margin to slow for the remainder of the year owing to higher revenue from lower margin accounts, changes to Medicaid reimbursement, and partially offset by higher-margin generics,"" Gill wrote in a note to clients. Gill noted that the company's PharMerica division's margins dropped while net income was slashed in half. Others picked up on that shortfall as well. John W. Ransom at Raymond James said that he does not ""expect significant improvement at the division during this fiscal year,"" and noted that the PharMerica earnings disappointed investors again.

The agency said the outlook change is based on its belief that the transition to a fee-for-service business model is largely behind the company and core distribution margins are now stable to improving; cash flow relative to current debt levels is expected to remain solid despite very low drug distribution margins and challenges faced in the PharMerica segment; the company's strong liquidity position offers significant flexibility; and AmerisourceBergen is not likely to need to raise leverage to pursue shareholder investments. The positive outlook also assumes the company will generate sufficient operating cash flow to make moderate-sized acquisitions without significantly increasing financial leverage, Moody's said.","Feb 2, 2006 1:21 p.m. ET",0,Moody's revises outlook on AmerisourceBergen to 'positive',https://www.marketwatch.com/story/moodys-revises-outlook-on-amerisourcebergen-to-positive
ABC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- A pair of U.S. market sectors that feature solid, cash-rich balance sheets, attractive valuations and the potential for mergers and acquisitions would seemingly rate high on investors' radar. Yet most shareholders aren't beating a path to technology and health-care stocks. Strategists at brokerage Charles Schwab & Co. took note of the combination of strong fundamentals and relative neglect and recently upgraded their outlook for the tech and health-care sectors. Technology stocks could outperform against a favorable backdrop for business spending, said Brad Sorenson, senior sector analyst at the Schwab Center for Investment Research. ""We're at the beginning of an acceleration of capital spending,"" he said. ""As companies try to increase efficiency to better compete globally, improved technology is one way to do that."" Health-care issues, meanwhile, have been beaten down, and investment risk is largely priced into the shares, Sorenson added. In addition, the strategist said he expects merger and acquisition activity to accelerate as large pharmaceutical firms seek to broaden their product pipelines. The upbeat call for tech and health care coincides with an expected slowdown in U.S. corporate growth, Sorenson said. He anticipates that the Federal Reserve's cycle of short-term interest-rate hikes is nearing an end. ""If [the Fed] shows more of a hand that they're close to done, we could see an overall rally in the market,"" Sorenson said. With earnings growth becoming scarcer, investors would look to the growth-driven stocks that dominate technology and health care, he added. In technology, the Schwab research group favors semiconductor firms like National Semiconductor NSM, -0.28% and information-technology concerns such as Tech Data TECD, +2.14% Schwab's health-care sector recommendations -- which emphasize valuation, analyst ratings and shares' momentum -- include Amerisource Bergen Corp. ABC, +1.29% King Pharmaceuticals Inc. KG, +4.65% and McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15% ""Health care offers defensive characteristics against a further economic slowdown that we are currently projecting, while offering growth characteristics that could allow for earnings expansion,"" Sorenson wrote in a report to clients. Maximum exposure Many mutual-fund managers would agree that technology and health care offer ample opportunities. Some are confident enough to allocate substantial portions of their portfolios to these sectors. For example, Smith Barney Large Cap Growth Fund SBLGX, +1.55% had 28% of its $6.1 billion in assets committed to tech and another 22% to health care. Manager Alan Blake is drawn to shares of out-of-favor companies that nonetheless sport rapid earnings growth, solid management and a dominant market share. The fund manager displays ""a keen eye for recognizing quality growth companies amid short-term blips in their stock prices,"" wrote Kerry O'Boyle, an analyst at investment researcher Morningstar Inc., in an early January report. The Smith Barney fund is a concentrated portfolio, with about 43% of assets in its top 10 holdings. At Dec. 31, the fund's biggest stakes were Internet retailer Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.11% biotechnology giants Genentech Inc. DNA, -1.03% and Amgen Inc. AMGN, +0.01% and semiconductor leader Texas Instruments Inc. TXN, +1.94% Another technology and health-care true believer is Brandywine Blue Fund BLUEX, +1.75% with about 44% of its $1.3 billion asset base invested in these two areas. Manager William D'Alonzo also runs a focused portfolio, keeping about 44% of assets in his 10-largest positions. Holdings in Coventry Health Care Inc. CV.H, +0.00% and Aetna Inc. AET, -0.25% reflect some main health-care ideas, while tech is represented in part by investments in Oracle Corp. ORCL, +1.71% Adobe Systems Inc. ADBE, +1.67% Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR, +1.16% and Analog Devices Inc. ADI, +1.36% Tech and health care account for 42% of First American Large Cap Growth Opportunities Fund FRGWX Co-managers Thomas Gunderson and Hal Goldstein stash big portions of this $1 billion portfolio in shares of Unitedhealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06% and Medtronic Inc. MDT, +2.24% a medical-device firm. A good portion of the fund's tech weighting comes from Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.10% Intel Corp. INTC, +5.00% and Google Inc. GOOG, +2.71% ABN AMRO Growth Fund CHTIX has 23% of its $1.3 billion asset base in technology and another 17% in health care. Tech holdings in this large-capitalization fund include Qualcomm Inc. QCOM, +1.30% and Texas Instruments. Co-managers Bernard Myszkowski and Richard Drake also invest in medical-device maker St. Jude Medical Inc. STJ, -0.32% and biotech firm Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, +0.82% ""Myszkowski and Drake's focus on profitable, financially strong growth stocks may not be sexy and won't always be popular, but it's an attractive approach for long-term investing,"" wrote Morningstar analyst David Kathman in an early January research report. Another portfolio with its heart in tech and health care is Goldman Sachs Growth Opportunities Fund GGOAX, +1.48% The $2.1 billion portfolio has 19% of assets in tech and another 16% in health care. Top holdings include: medical-device manufacturer Biomet Inc. BMET, +0.00% ; Fisher Scientific International, the laboratory research supplier FSH, -12.16% ; bar-code developer Zebra Technologies Corp. ZBRA, +2.38% and semiconductor leader Linear Technology Corp. LLTC ""We're confident about the longer-term prospects for the fund,"" Morningstar analyst John Coumarianos wrote in a report on the Goldman Sachs offering last September. ""Although it may not keep up with its more aggressive peers in a tech rally, we think its attention to long-term cash flow generation can help it in a slower-growth environment, when an earnings miss can send a richly priced stock reeling."" 5 funds that favor tech and health care stocks Fund Technology % Assets Health Care % Assets 1-year return 3-year annualized return Smith Barney Large Cap Growth A SBLGX, +1.55% 28.2% 22.2% 9.66% 15.96% Brandywine Blue BLUEX, +1.75% 25.5 18 17.47 21.21 First American Large Cap Growth Opp A FRGWX 23.5 18.2 12.21 15.01 ABN AMRO GROWTH N CHTIX 22.9 17.1 7.54 11.29 Goldman Sachs Growth Opp A GGOAX, +1.48% 19.2 15.8 13.25 20.38 Sources: Morningstar Inc.

ABC,"Mar 16, 2018 (Euclid Infotech Ltd via COMTEX) -- U.S. Senator Claire McCaskill, who is currently leading the largest Congressional investigation to date into the opioid epidemic, is praising the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital after a recent VA report showed a 34% decrease in opioid prescribing at the facility between 2012-2017. McCaskill is also seeking additional details about decreasing opioid use within the VA healthcare system nationally. The Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital is setting an example for our state and our country on how to cut down on unnecessary opioid prescriptions, McCaskill said. As weve seen during the course of my investigation into opioid manufacturers, our sky-high prescription rates came in the aftermath of targeted marketing campaigns and minimizing the risks of addictionits great to see the VA start to reverse a decades-long trend of increased use. A Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) report released earlier this year analyzed opioid prescribing data at VA Medical Centers as a part of their Opioid Safety Initiative. At the Harry S. Truman Memorial Veterans Hospital, opioid prescribing rates decreased by 34%. While there are innumerable challenges in addressing [the opioid] epidemic, there has been measurable progress within the VA healthcare system, McCaskill wrote in a letter to VA Secretary David Shulkin. McCaskill requested details on what the VA will do to build on the initial success of the Opioid Safety Initiative and continue the decrease in opioid prescribing rates. She also asked about the VAs opioid prescribing guidelines and its efforts to share lessons from its initiative with the private sector. McCaskill last year launched her investigation into opioid manufacturersthe most comprehensive Congressional investigation into the crisis to datewhen she requested information related to sales and marketing materials, internal addiction studies, details on compliance with government settlements and donations to third party advocacy groups from major opioid manufacturers. She expanded her investigation, requesting documents and information from opioid manufacturers Mallinckrodt, Endo, Teva, and Allergan, while a request to McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, and Cardinal Health, Inc., focused on their distribution of opioid products. In September, McCaskill announced the first round of findings, detailing systemic manipulation of the prior authorization process by Insys Therapeutics. McCaskills latest report, issued earlier this year, describes how manufacturers of opioids have made significant financial investments into third party organizationsgroups which in turn have often engaged in pro-opioid advocacy. McCaskill is currently working on legislation to strengthen the Drug Enforcement Administrations opioid enforcement abilities. After media reports indicated that the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act of 2016 had dramatically restricted DEAs ability to crack down on opioid distributors suspected of wrongdoing, McCaskill introduced a bill to repeal the law, and she led a Senate roundtable on her bill.","Mar 16, 2018 7:43 p.m. ET",N/A,"United States : Harry S.

ABC,"NAPLES, Fla., March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- At pill distributor AmerisourceBergen's ABC, +1.29% shareholder meeting Thursday, the board of directors and top executives will face surging investor demand for precedent-setting reforms aimed at holding the company accountable for its role in fueling the opioid crisis. Amid mounting scrutiny of AmerisourceBergen and a year of calls for reform from the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the union along with other members of a growing group of institutional investors with more than $2.2 trillion in assets are pressing shareholders to support measures that would instill rigorous, independent oversight and greater transparency. The Teamsters and its affiliated pension and benefit funds -- long-term shareholders of AmerisourceBergen -- have been leading a shareholder effort that has been racking up victories at AmerisourceBergen's top competitors McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, while the Philadelphia-area company falls behind. The Thursday meeting at a Ritz Carlton in Naples could change the company's trajectory and marks the first time shareholders of any major drug company can institute a comprehensive package of governance changes directly tied to the opioid crisis. The proposals, filed by the Teamsters and other members of a fast-growing coalition known as ""Investors for Opioid Accountability,"" include: A proposal submitted by the Teamsters calling for an independent chairman of the board to assure shareholders that their interests are being safeguarded as the company navigates challenges stemming from its role in the opioid crisis. A clawback disclosure proposal submitted by the UAW Retiree Medical Benefits Trust and the Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds to strengthen the effectiveness of these policies by enhancing transparency. A proposal submitted by the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, Trinity Health, JLens Investor Network and Missionary Oblates OIP Investment Trust requesting a report on how the board is addressing opioid-related business risks. ""What a difference a year makes: when we went to the AmerisourceBergen shareholder meeting last year, the opioid crisis wasn't on the radar of most investors; but after investor revolts at McKesson and Cardinal Health, it is now front and center for AmerisourceBergen shareholders,"" said Ken Hall, General Secretary-Treasurer of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. The union, along with state elected officials and recovery groups, kicked off the effort for accountability at the ""Big Three"" drug distributors at AmerisourceBergen's annual meeting last year. ""AmerisourceBergen shareholders can be a force for good and make the company an industry leader rather than a toxin that's holding our nation back and fueling the worst public health crisis of our time. The Teamsters union is proud to stand with shareholders and communities across the country determined to make our voices heard and will continue fighting to hold our nation's healthcare industry accountable."" Hall will present the Teamsters' proposal on the meeting floor, and Tom McCaney of the Sisters of St. Francis in Philadelphia will deliver remarks in support of his organization's proposal as well as the clawback disclosure measure. Additionally, among those slated to speak is Travis Bornstein, president of Teamsters Local 24 in Akron, Ohio, whose son Tyler became addicted to opioids and died of an overdose in 2014 at age 23. ""As Pennsylvania grapples with the nation's fourth-highest overdose rate, AmerisourceBergen is fleeing its home state and running away to Florida to escape the scrutiny,"" McCaney said. ""But that won't stop shareholders from demanding the reforms and culture of accountability desperately needed to address the company's role in fueling the opioid crisis. Together, we have the chance to chart a new course not only for AmerisourceBergen, but for the entire healthcare industry, and I'm proud to stand together with investors of all backgrounds determined to make a difference."" In February, two leading proxy advisory firms, Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) came out in support of the coalition's proposals, with Glass Lewis noting in its report: ""we do not believe that the company has sufficiently outlined the governance measures that the company has taken to effectively monitor and manage financial and reputational risks."" Background After kicking off a year ago with a group of Teamsters, elected officials and recovery groups protesting at AmerisourceBergen's annual meeting, the effort to hold major prescription drug distributors accountable for their role in the opioid epidemic has grown into a winning force in the battle to address the national crisis. In July, McKesson Corporation investors backed the Teamsters' call to reject the board's executive pay proposal, with the company also acquiescing to Teamster-led demands to separate the CEO and chairman positions in the future. Only months later, the Teamsters took its call for stronger accountability and corporate governance to Cardinal Health' s annual meeting, leading the company to announce that its next board chair will be an independent director. In contrast, the response from AmerisourceBergen's Board of Directors to growing shareholder and public scrutiny around the opioid crisis has been relatively mute. AmerisourceBergen is facing mounting pressure from multiple fronts related to its opioid distribution practices, including regulatory settlements and hundreds of lawsuits filed by public and private parties. Last year, AmerisourceBergen agreed to a potentially precedent setting $16 million settlement with the state of West Virginia relating to its role in distributing opioids. This week, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessionsannounced the creation of a new task force on opioid distributors and manufacturers and said his department filed a statement of interest in a case involving hundreds of lawsuits related to the distribution of opioid products. AmerisourceBergen has become the subject of an investigation by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which recently demanded new information on how the country's largest drug distributors authorized the flow of more than 423 million pills into West Virginia over just a six-year period. AmerisourceBergen alone distributed more than 132 million of those doses.  Additionally, the company recently purchased H.D. Smith, a smaller distributor identified by Congressional investigators as having, in a single year, shipped 3,000 hydrocodone pills per day to a West Virginian town with only 1,800 residents. McKesson, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health are the three largest wholesale prescription drug distributors in the country. Ranking #5, #12, and #21 on the list of Fortune 500 companies, the ""Big Three"" have reported more than $480 billion in revenue and $7 billion in net income over the past year. The three companies are responsible for 85 percent of all prescription drug distribution in the country, and therefore play an outsized role in providing access to prescription opioids across the country. The Teamsters and its affiliated pension and benefit funds have more than $100 billion in assets invested in the capital markets and are long-term investors in each of the ""Big Three"" wholesale distributors.

Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 2.75% in the reported quarter, an increase of 3 basis points from the prior year's corresponding quarter. AmerisourceBergen's gross profit in Q1 FY18 was $1.1 billion, up 4.5% on a y-o-y basis, primarily due to the increase in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services. For Q1 FY18, AmerisourceBergen's operating expenses were $693.7 million compared to $637.7 million in Q1 FY17. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by operating additional distribution centers in the reported quarter and duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems as well as increased costs to support the Company's revenue growth. During Q1 FY18, AmerisourceBergen's operating income was $419.0 million versus $400.0 million in Q1 FY17. The Company's adjusted operating income of $488.1 million inched up 0.4% on a y-o-y basis.

The increase in net income was primarily driven by the benefit from US tax reform. On an adjusted basis, the Company's earnings were $1.55 per diluted share, up 14% on a y-o-y basis compared to $1.36 in the year earlier same quarter, driven primarily by a $0.15 benefit from US tax reform. The Company's earnings beat Wall Street's estimates of $1.35 per share. AmerisourceBergen's Segment Results During Q1 FY18, the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment's revenue grew 5.8% to $38.94 billion compared to $36.80 billion in Q1 FY17. In the reported quarter, the segment's operating income of $388.18 million grew 2.4% versus $379.06 million in the prior year's comparable quarter. For Q1 FY18, AmerisourceBergen' revenue in Other segment totaled $1.54 billion compared to $1.38 billion in Q1 FY17, reflecting an increase of 11.6% on a y-o-y basis. Operating income in Other segment dropped 6.4% to $100.3 million on a y-oy- basis in the reported quarter, primarily driven by performance at ABCS, specifically the Lash Group, and MWI and was partially offset by the contribution from World Courier. Outlook For fiscal year 2018, AmerisourceBergen is forecasting revenue growth in the range of 8% to 11% and adjusted diluted earnings per share to be in the band of $6.45 to $6.65. The Company is estimating adjusted operating income growth in the range of 1% to 4%, Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment's operating income growth to be in the band of 1% to 4%, and Other segment's operating income growth in the band of flat to 2%.

ABC,"VALLEY FORGE, Pa., Feb 15, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- AmerisourceBergen, a global healthcare solutions leader, released the following comment regarding the announcement by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) that it would add a new feature to its ARCOS Online Reporting System to enable manufacturers and distributors to view the number of competitors selling controlled substances to prospective customers within a six-month window: “AmerisourceBergen supports yesterday’s actions by the DEA, which represent progress toward the goal we have promoted of achieving increased industry data transparency between the DEA, drug distributors and pharmacies. This is a step forward on the path to being able to more effectively collaborate to identify and stop nefarious actors within the pharmaceutical supply chain. Distributors have long been individually required to report controlled substance data to DEA, and we will now be able to see how many of our peers within the industry are supplying opioid-based medicines to the same pharmacies we are. This should help distributors in detecting suspicious orders. We strongly encourage DEA to build on yesterday's progress against opioid abuse in America, by allowing even greater access to additional ‘scrubbed’ and de-identified data so we can evaluate the full context of a particular pharmacy opioid order.” About AmerisourceBergen AmerisourceBergen provides pharmaceutical products, value-driving services and business solutions that improve access to care.

ABC,"VALLEY FORGE, Pa., Feb 06, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- AmerisourceBergen Corporation ABC, +1.29% today reported that in its fiscal year 2018 first quarter ended December 31, 2017, revenue increased 6.0 percent to $40.5 billion. On the basis of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), diluted earnings per share (EPS) was $3.90 for the December quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $1.11 in the prior year quarter. GAAP EPS for the December quarter of fiscal 2018 was favorably impacted by new U.S. tax reform legislation. Adjusted diluted EPS, which is a non-GAAP measure that excludes items described below, increased 14.0 percent to $1.55 in the fiscal first quarter and also included a benefit from the Company's expected full fiscal year effective tax rate. AmerisourceBergen is updating its outlook for fiscal year 2018. The Company does not provide forward-looking guidance on a GAAP basis, as discussed below in Fiscal Year 2018 Expectations. Adjusted diluted EPS guidance has been raised from the previous expectation of $5.90 to $6.15 to a range of $6.45 to $6.65, reflecting growth of 10 percent to 13 percent versus last fiscal year. The adjusted diluted EPS benefit from U.S. tax reform is expected to be approximately $0.60 in fiscal 2018, offset by a lower than expected contribution from PharMEDium. “In the first quarter of the fiscal year, we saw further market, pricing and competitive stability. AmerisourceBergen continued to lead the market in specialty product distribution and pharmaceutical services and our core pharmaceutical distribution businesses executed extremely well - growing volumes with key customers and segments - and continued to effectively manage operating expenses. We are proud of the work our associates have done and pleased with this strong start for the fiscal year,” said Steven H. Collis, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of AmerisourceBergen. “Our updated outlook for fiscal 2018 reflects this performance and the expected benefit of U.S. tax reform, partially offset by a lower than expected contribution from PharMEDium. We remain confident in PharMEDium's ability to return to its long-term growth trajectory, and committed to providing our customers with the highest quality products and services as we continue to invest in AmerisourceBergen,” Mr. Collis continued. “AmerisourceBergen’s scale, proven ability to execute, strategic evolution and continued investment position the Company for long-term growth as we innovate and deliver value to our shareholders. We are living our corporate purpose and are united in our responsibility to create healthier futures.”   First Quarter Fiscal Year 2018 Summary Results                                       GAAP       Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Revenue       $40.5B       $40.5B Gross Profit       $1.1B       $1.1B Operating Expenses       $694M       $625M Operating Income       $419M       $488M Interest Expense, Net       $36M       $36M Tax Rate       (140.1)%       24.2% Net Income       $862M       $342M Diluted Shares Outstanding       221M       221M Diluted Earnings Per Share       $3.90       $1.55   Below, AmerisourceBergen presents descriptive summaries of the Company’s GAAP quarterly results as well as its adjusted (Non-GAAP) quarterly results.

Gross Profit: Gross profit in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $1.1 billion, a 7.2 percent increase over the same period in the previous fiscal year, primarily due to the increase in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services and the decrease in LIFO expense of $28.3 million. Gross profit as a percentage of revenue was 2.75%, an increase of 3 basis points from the prior year quarter. Operating Expenses: In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, operating expenses were $693.7 million, compared to $637.7 million in the same period last fiscal year. The increase in operating expenses was primarily driven by operating additional distribution centers in the current quarter and duplicate costs resulting from the implementation of new information technology systems, as well as increased costs to support our revenue growth. Operating Income: In the fiscal 2018 first quarter, operating income was $419.0 million versus $400.0 million in the prior year period. Interest Expense, Net:In the fiscal 2018 first quarter, net interest expense of $35.9 million was down 3.0 percent versus the prior year quarter. Tax Rate: The effective tax rate of (140.1)% for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 benefited from $587.6 million of discrete tax benefits recognized and a reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, both resulting from U.S. tax reform. Diluted Earnings Per Share: Diluted earnings per share was $3.90 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $1.11 in the previous fiscal year’s first quarter, primarily driven by the benefit from U.S. tax reform. Diluted Shares Outstanding: Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 were 220.8 million, a 0.5 percent decline versus the prior fiscal year first quarter due primarily to share repurchases, net of stock option exercises.

In addition, we previously issued $600 million of 1.15 percent senior notes that were repaid in May 2017 to fund our initial special share repurchase program. The interest expense incurred relating to this borrowing has been excluded from the Non-GAAP presentation. First Quarter Adjusted (Non-GAAP) Results Revenue: In the first quarter of fiscal 2018, revenue was $40.5 billion, up 6.0 percent compared to the same quarter in the previous fiscal year, reflecting a 5.8 percent increase in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue and an 11.6 percent increase in revenue within Other. Adjusted Gross Profit: Gross profit in the fiscal 2018 first quarter was $1.1 billion, which was up 4.5 percent when compared to the same period in the previous year, primarily due to the increase in gross profit in Pharmaceutical Distribution Services.

Adjusted Operating Income: In the fiscal 2018 first quarter, operating income of $488.1 million increased 0.4 percent from the prior year period. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 6 basis points to 1.21 percent in the fiscal 2018 first quarter compared to the previous fiscal year’s first quarter.

Adjusted Tax Rate: The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 was 24.2 percent, down from 33.1 percent in the previous fiscal year’s first quarter, primarily driven by a reduction in the U.S. federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%, as a result of U.S. tax reform. Adjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share: Diluted earnings per share was up 14.0 percent to $1.55 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to $1.36 in the previous fiscal year’s first quarter, driven primarily by a $0.15 benefit from U.S. tax reform. Diluted Shares Outstanding: Diluted weighted average shares outstanding for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 were 220.8 million, a 0.5 percent decline versus the prior fiscal year first quarter due primarily to share repurchases, net of stock option exercises. Segment Discussion The Company's operations are comprised of the Pharmaceutical Distribution Services reportable segment and other operating segments that are not significant enough to require separate reportable segment disclosure and, therefore, have been included in Other for the purpose of reportable segment presentation. Other consists of operating segments that focus on global commercialization services and animal health and includes AmerisourceBergen Consulting Services (ABCS), World Courier and MWI Animal Health (MWI). Pharmaceutical Distribution Services Segment Pharmaceutical Distribution Services revenue was $38.9 billion, an increase of 5.8 percent compared to the same quarter in the prior fiscal year. Segment operating income of $388.2 million in the December quarter of fiscal 2018 was up 2.4 percent compared to the same period in the previous fiscal year. The segment was impacted by reduced production at PharMEDium's Memphis 503B outsourcing facility, where, following inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, operations were voluntarily suspended in December so that the company could execute certain remedial measures. Other Revenue in Other was $1.5 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, an increase of 11.6 percent compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year as all three business units contributed to revenue growth in the quarter. Operating income in Other decreased 6.4 percent to $100.3 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. This decrease was primarily driven by performance at ABCS, specifically the Lash Group, and MWI and was partially offset by the contribution from World Courier. Recent Company Highlights & Milestones Completed the acquisition of H. D. Smith, the largest independent pharmaceutical wholesaler in the U.S., which enhances and expands our strategic scale, strengthens our support to community pharmacy and drives long-term, durable value. Recorded our 16th consecutive quarter with 10 percent or greater revenue growth in Specialty distribution.

D. Smith and lower than originally anticipated operating income contributions from PharMEDium and the Lash Group, AmerisourceBergen has updated its fiscal year 2018 financial guidance. The Company expects: Revenue growth in the range of 8 percent to 11 percent; and Adjusted diluted earnings per share now to be in the range of $6.45 to $6.65. Additional expectations now include: Adjusted operating expenses to increase between 6 percent to 8 percent; Adjusted operating income growth in the range of 1 percent to 4 percent; Pharmaceutical Distribution Services segment operating income growth in the range of 1 percent to 4 percent; Other, which is comprised of businesses focused on Global Commercialization Services and Animal Health, operating income growth in the range of flat to 2 percent; Adjusted effective tax rate of between 23 percent and 24 percent; Adjusted free cash flow to be approximately $1.35 billion to $1.6 billion; Capital expenditures of approximately $325 million; and Share repurchases will offset dilution from employee stock option exercises. AmerisourceBergen also continues to operate under the following working assumptions regarding the pharmaceutical market: Brand drug inflation to be in the range of 6 percent to 7 percent; Generic drug deflation to be in the range of -7 percent to -9 percent; Contributions from new generic launches similar to the prior year; and No significant contributions from biosimilars.

Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected, anticipated, or implied are the following: unfavorable trends in brand and generic pharmaceutical pricing, including in rate or frequency of price inflation or deflation; competition and industry consolidation of both customers and suppliers resulting in increasing pressure to reduce prices for our products and services; changes in pharmaceutical market growth rates; changes in the United States healthcare and regulatory environment, including changes that could impact prescription drug reimbursement under Medicare and Medicaid; increasing governmental regulations regarding the pharmaceutical supply channel and pharmaceutical compounding; declining reimbursement rates for pharmaceuticals; federal and state government enforcement initiatives to detect and prevent suspicious orders of controlled substances and the diversion of controlled substances; increased public concern over the abuse of opioid medications; prosecution or suit by federal, state and other governmental entities of alleged violations of laws and regulations regarding controlled substances, and any related disputes, including shareholder derivative lawsuits; increased federal scrutiny and litigation, including qui tam litigation, for alleged violations of laws and regulations governing the marketing, sale, purchase and/or dispensing of pharmaceutical products or services, and associated reserves and costs, including the reserve recorded in connection with the proceedings with the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York; material adverse resolution of pending legal proceedings; the retention of key customer or supplier relationships under less favorable economics or the adverse resolution of any contract or other dispute with customers or suppliers; changes to customer or supplier payment terms; risks associated with the strategic, long-term relationship between Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. and the Company, including principally with respect to the pharmaceutical distribution agreement and/or the global generic purchasing services arrangement; changes in tax laws or legislative initiatives that could adversely affect the Company’s tax positions and/or the Company’s tax liabilities or adverse resolution of challenges to the Company’s tax positions; regulatory action in connection with the production, labeling or packaging of products compounded by our compounded sterile preparations (CSP) business; suspension of production of CSPs, including a prolonged suspension at our Memphis 503B outsourcing facility; failure to realize the expected benefits from our reorganization and other business process initiatives; managing foreign expansion, including non-compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, anti-bribery laws and economic sanctions and import laws and regulations; declining economic conditions in the United States and abroad; financial market volatility and disruption; substantial defaults in payment, material reduction in purchases by or the loss, bankruptcy or insolvency of a major customer; the loss, bankruptcy or insolvency of a major supplier; changes to the customer or supplier mix; malfunction, failure or breach of sophisticated information systems to operate as designed; risks generally associated with data privacy regulation and the international transfer of personal data; natural disasters or other unexpected events that affect the Company’s operations; the impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, resulting in a charge to earnings; the acquisition of businesses that do not perform as expected, or that are difficult to integrate or control, including the integration of H. D. Smith and PharMEDium, or the inability to capture all of the anticipated synergies related thereto or to capture the anticipated synergies within the expected time period; the effects of disruption from the transactions on the respective businesses of the Company and H. D. Smith and the fact that the transactions may make it more difficult to establish or maintain relationships with employees, suppliers, customers and other business partners; the disruption of the Company’s cash flow and ability to return value to its stockholders in accordance with its past practices; interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations; and other economic, business, competitive, legal, tax, regulatory and/or operational factors affecting the Company’s business generally. Certain additional factors that management believes could cause actual outcomes and results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements are set forth (i) in Item 1A (Risk Factors) in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017 and elsewhere in that report and (ii) in other reports filed by the Company pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act.

[3] Includes a $318.7 million increase in income taxes payable for the three months ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a one-time transition tax on historical foreign earnings and profits through December 31, 2017 in connection with tax reform.   [4] Net borrowings were primarily used to finance the acquisition of H.D. Smith, which was completed on January 2, 2018.   SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION REGARDING NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES To supplement the financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the Company uses the following non-GAAP financial measures: (i) adjusted gross profit; (ii) adjusted operating expenses; (iii) adjusted operating income; (iv) adjusted interest expense, net; (v) adjusted net income; (vi) adjusted tax rate; and (vii) adjusted diluted earnings per share. The non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in addition to, and not in lieu of, financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. These supplemental measures may vary from, and may not be comparable to, similarly titled measures by other companies. The non-GAAP financial measures are presented because management uses non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company’s operating performance, to perform financial planning, and to determine incentive compensation. Therefore, the Company believes that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures provides useful supplementary information to, and facilitates additional analysis by, investors. The presented non-GAAP financial measures exclude items that management does not believe reflect the Company’s core operating performance as such items are outside the control of the Company or due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature. We have included the following non-GAAP earnings-related financial measures in this release: Adjusted gross profit and adjusted gross profit margin: Adjusted gross profit is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the gain from antitrust litigation settlements and LIFO expense because the Company cannot control the amounts recognized or timing of these items. Adjusted gross profit margin is the ratio of adjusted gross profit to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental measure of the Company’s ongoing operating performance. The gain from antitrust litigation settlements relates to the settlement of class action lawsuits that have been filed against brand pharmaceutical manufacturers alleging that the manufacturer, by itself or in concert with others, took improper actions to delay or prevent generic drugs from entering the market. LIFO expense is affected by changes in inventory quantities, product mix, and manufacturer pricing practices, which may be impacted by market and other external influences. Adjusted operating expenses and adjusted operating expense margin: Adjusted operating expenses is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes acquisition-related intangibles amortization and employee severance, litigation, and other. Adjusted operating expense margin is the ratio of adjusted operating expenses to total revenue. The acquisition-related intangibles amortization is excluded because it is a non-cash item and does not reflect the operating performance of the acquired companies. We exclude employee severance amounts that relate to non-recurring organizational restructuring. We exclude the amount of litigation settlements and other expenses that are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature because we believe these exclusions facilitate the analysis of our ongoing operational performance. Adjusted operating income and adjusted operating income margin: Adjusted operating income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted gross profit and adjusted operating expenses. Adjusted operating income margin is the ratio of adjusted operating income to total revenue. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company’s performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature. Adjusted interest expense, net: Adjusted interest expense is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the interest expense on our $600 million of 1.15% senior notes that were repaid in May 2017 (the “2017 Notes”). The 2017 Notes were issued to fund a special $650 million share repurchase program under which we purchased shares to reduce the dilution related to the warrants that we issued in March 2013 to wholly-owned subsidiaries of Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors in evaluating the Company’s ongoing interest expense, net. Adjusted tax rate: Adjusted tax rate is a non-GAAP financial measure that is determined by dividing adjusted income tax expense/benefit by adjusted income before income taxes. Adjusted net income: Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure that excludes the same items that are described above and excluded from adjusted gross profit, adjusted operating expenses, adjusted operating income, and adjusted interest expense, net. In addition, the loss on the early retirement of debt and the one-time impact of U.S. tax reform (""Tax Reform"") are excluded from adjusted net income. Tax Reform includes a benefit from applying a lower U.S. federal income tax rate to the Company's net deferred tax liabilities as of December 31, 2017, offset in part by a one-time transition tax on historical foreign earnings and profits through December 31, 2017. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors as a supplemental way to evaluate the Company's performance because the adjustments are unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature. Adjusted diluted earnings per share: Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the per share impact of adjustments including gain from antitrust litigation settlements; LIFO expense; acquisition-related intangibles amortization; employee severance, litigation, and other; the interest expense incurred in connection with the 2017 Notes; and the loss on early retirement of debt; in each case net of the tax effect calculated using the applicable effective tax rate for those items. In addition, the per share impact of Tax Reform is excluded from adjusted diluted earnings per share. Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure is useful to investors because it eliminates the per share impact of the items that are outside the control of the Company or that we consider to not be indicative of our ongoing operating performance due to their inherent unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring, or non-cash nature. In addition, the Company has provided non-GAAP fiscal year 2018 guidance for diluted earnings per share, operating expense, operating income, and effective income tax rate that excludes the same or similar items as those that are excluded from the historical non-GAAP financial measures, as well as significant items that are outside the control of the Company or inherently unusual, non-operating, unpredictable, non-recurring or non-cash in nature. In addition, it has provided 2018 free cash flow guidance. For fiscal year 2018, we have defined the non-GAAP financial measure of free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities, excluding other significant unpredictable or non-recurring cash payments or receipts relating to legal settlements, minus capital expenditures. The Company does not provide forward looking guidance on a GAAP basis for such metrics because certain financial information, the probable significance of which cannot be determined, is not available and cannot be reasonably estimated. For example, LIFO expense is largely dependent upon the future inflation or deflation of brand and generic pharmaceuticals, which is out of the Company’s control, and acquisition-related intangibles amortization depends on the timing and amount of future acquisitions, which cannot be reasonably estimated. Similarly, the timing and amount of litigation settlements is unpredictable and non-recurring.

ABC,"TORRANCE, Calif., Jan 17, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Emmaus Life Sciences announced today that Endari is now available by prescription in the United States. Endari was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older. Endari is available by prescription through U.S. Bioservices, a national specialty pharmacy and a part of AmerisourceBergen. “We’ve received overwhelming support and positive feedback from payers, physicians, advocacy groups and sickle cell patients, who have awaited a new treatment option for this debilitating disease for a long time,” said Yutaka Niihara, MD, MPH, chairman and CEO of Emmaus Life Sciences. “Now that Endari is available, several insurance companies have expedited their review for formulary addition to address this unmet medical need.” Endari is the first new treatment approved by the FDA for pediatric patients 5 years of age and older with sickle cell disease, and the first new treatment approved by the FDA in nearly 20 years for adult patients. [1] FDA’s approval of Endari is based on safety and effectiveness data from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial of 230 patients ages 5 to 58 years old with sickle cell disease who had 2 or more painful crises within 12 months prior to enrollment. Patients who were treated with Endari over a 48-week period experienced fewer crisis episodes compared to patients who received a placebo (median 3 vs median 4); fewer hospitalizations for sickle cell pain (median 2 vs median 3), and fewer days in the hospital (median 6.5 days vs median 11 days). Patients on Endari also had fewer occurrences of acute chest syndrome, a life-threatening complication of sickle cell disease (8.6 percent vs 23.1 percent). A sickle cell crisis was defined as a visit to an emergency room/medical facility for sickle cell disease-related pain treated with a parenterally administered narcotic or ketorolac; the occurrence of chest syndrome, priapism, and splenic sequestration were also considered sickle cell crises. The most common side effects of Endari seen during the study included constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in the extremities, back pain and chest pain. Many of these side effects were also seen in patients taking placebo. Emmaus continues to work actively with payers to ensure coverage and access for patients with sickle cell disease. About Sickle Cell Disease Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder characterized by the production of an altered form of hemoglobin which polymerizes and becomes fibrous, causing red blood cells to become rigid and change form so that they appear sickle shaped instead of soft and rounded. Patients with sickle cell disease suffer from debilitating episodes of sickle cell crises, which occur when the rigid, adhesive and inflexible red blood cells occlude blood vessels. Sickle cell crises cause excruciating pain as a result of insufficient oxygen being delivered to tissue, referred to as tissue ischemia, and inflammation. These events may lead to a variety of other adverse outcomes such as acute chest syndrome that requires hospitalization. Sickle cell disease is an orphan disease, affecting approximately 100,000 patients in the U.S. and millions worldwide with significant unmet medical needs. About Endari™ Indication Endari is indicated to reduce the acute complications of sickle cell disease in adult and pediatric patients 5 years of age and older. Important Safety Information The most common adverse reactions (incidence >10%) in clinical studies were constipation, nausea, headache, abdominal pain, cough, pain in extremity, back pain, and chest pain. Adverse reactions leading to treatment discontinuation included 1 case each of hypersplenism, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, burning sensation, and hot flash. The safety and efficacy of Endari in pediatric patients with sickle cell disease younger than 5 years of age has not been established. For more information, please see full Prescribing Information of Endari at www.ENDARIrx.com/Repository/Prescribing%20information.pdf About Emmaus Life Sciences Emmaus Life Sciences, Inc. is engaged in the discovery, development and commercialization of innovative treatments and therapies for rare diseases.
