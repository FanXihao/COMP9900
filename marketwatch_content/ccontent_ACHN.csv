ACHN,"Everyone likes free offers. With the biotechnology stock sector so badly pummeled, that’s exactly what you find there now. The shares of many biotech companies have fallen so far, their market values are below their net cash. Buy the stock, and the price you paid is more than offset by company cash. In that way, you get the business for “free.” Amazingly, 50 to 70 biotech companies now trade for less than net cash, depending on how you measure “net cash.” In technical terms, they have a negative enterprise value (EV), which is market value minus cash plus debt. Fotolia.com Gene editing is a new way to treat diseases. Those have to be bargains, right? Well, not so fast. You can flip this logic around and conclude the stock market assigns zero value to these businesses because, well, that’s what they deserve. “When a company is down to its cash, something hasn’t gone right,” says John McCamant of the Medical Technology Stock Letter. “You can buy one at cash, and it can go to half cash. It’s definitely tricky,” says Mike Tung, a medical doctor and biotech-sector investor at Turner Medical Sciences Long/Short Fund US:TMSEX which has a great track record. It beats competitors by 8% a year annualized over the past three years, according to Morningstar. ‘The one thing that is going to make a big difference is when big pharmaceutical companies come out and make significant acquisitions.’ Paul Yook, BioShare Biotechnology Product Fund In other words, as much as it’s tempting to be contrarian, a lot of times the market has it right. Still, not all biotech companies trading at or below cash are absolute dogs. I’ll reveal five of the larger ones with the biggest cash positions below for you to check out on your own — if you promise to keep in mind the risks. Better to go with “almost free” but well-funded A big risk for small biotech companies trading below cash is that the “funding window” has virtually closed. While there have been several biotech initial public offerings (IPOs) in the past few days, IPOs and follow-on stock offerings have dried up. And we don’t know when that will change, points out Brad Loncar, a biotech aficionado and founder of Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy CNCR, +1.54% an exchange traded fund (ETF). Since those companies still have expenses, or cash burn, they might run out of money before they can get more. “Even the healthy biotech companies have to raise cash frequently. It is like oxygen,” he says. Rather than fish among tiny, and thus very risky, biotech companies trading below cash levels, better to look for more established, quality companies that have lots of cash. Even if they aren’t “free.” Read: Only biotech companies have braved IPO market this year Tung, at Turner Medical Sciences Long/Short Fund, likes the following criteria. He favors biotech companies that look cheap because they trade for 1.5 to two times cash levels, as long as they have several years worth of cash and promising pipelines. Examples? Tung cites Prothena PRTA, +0.52% a company with a late-stage therapy for an ailment that causes organ damage called amyloidosis. It also has a partnership with big pharmaceutical Roche RHHBY, -0.61% Another is Retrophin RTRX, +2.57% a drug-development company once led by controversial “pharma bro” Martin Shkreli. Tung also cites Achillion Pharmaceuticals ACHN, +0.00% a hepatitis C drug company that has a partnership with heavyweight Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% McCamant, at the Medical Technology Stock Letter, cites Sangamo Biosciences SGMO, -3.68% which is developing gene-editing therapies. It has validating partnerships with Shire SHPG, +3.36% and Biogen BIIB, +0.74% among others. Loncar cites cancer-immunotherapy and gene-therapy companies Juno Therapeutics US:JUNO and bluebird bio BLUE, -0.81% as promising biotech companies that are well-funded via partnerships, or because they raised capital when the biotech sector was much stronger. About those “free” biotech companies ... But what about the freebies — the biotech stocks trading below net cash? The concept of “free” (if very risky) biotech companies can be alluring. Not all of them have to be dogs. The business could go right. There are certainly plenty to choose from. Using data provided by S&P Global Market Intelligence, I found 48 biotech companies trading below enterprise value, defined simply as market value plus debt minus cash. Using a more nuanced definition that includes balance-sheet items that resemble cash and debt, like holdings in other companies and preferred stock, Paul Yook of the BioShare Biotechnology Product Fund BBP, +1.07% found 67 of them for me. Genzyme Goes Eco-Friendly With R&D Facility Many of these are ridiculously small, too small to consider. But here are three of the larger ones, just to cite some examples. I’m not suggesting them as “buys.” There’s QLT US:QLTI a $130 million market-value company with a negative enterprise value, or net cash surplus, of around $17 million. Then there’s Arbutus Biopharma ABUS, -0.99% which recently had a $158 million market value and a negative enterprise value of $37 million. The most extreme example is Avalanche Biotechnologies US:AAVL a $117 million market-value company that has a negative enterprise value as high as $160 million, depending on how you measure it. Though he’s not suggesting them as buys since that’s not his job, Yook tells me that two cash-rich biotechs with potentially promising technology include Flex Pharma FLKS, -2.53% doing very early stage research on a therapy for muscle cramping and spasms; and Trillium Therapeutics TRIL, +0.70% in cancer-therapy research. Microcap biotech companies like those are extremely risky, and you need to tread lightly. So kick the tires yourself. Don’t put too much money in them. Buy perhaps several of them to diversify. And understand you still might lose everything. During the biotech heyday, “a lot of biotech companies went public that should not have gone public,” says Tung. “A lot of these companies will ultimately fail.” In short, these are not “widow and orphan” stocks, because the risks are so high. Even biotech companies with seemingly limited downside risk because they already trade below cash can tumble hard. Avalanche Biotechnologies is a good example. It might have looked “safe” at around $6 at the end of January because its market value was well below its $269 million in cash. But then it promptly fell 30% to trade in the low-$4 range on outsized volume after announcing a merger. What might lift the clouds over biotech? Of course, none of those stocks will work unless the extremely negative sentiment toward biotech eases. Worries about price controls might persist until the elections are over. But at least three catalysts could break the negativity along the way, say biotech analysts. 1. “The one thing that is going to make a big difference is when big pharmaceutical companies come out and make significant acquisitions,” says Yook. “It’s a matter of when, not if, the mergers-and-acquisitions activity picks up. That will be a very important catalyst.” Will this happen? Who knows. But several biotech giants like Merck MRK, -1.13% say they’re already shopping. 2. Positive study results can hit at any moment. And they will flow for sure at important sector conferences like the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in early June. 3. At some point, investors might just wake up and realize a lot of biotech stocks look cheap. “The sector continues to be very productive in terms of new research, new medicines and sales,” says Yook. “The revenue growth is dramatic.” He says the 35 companies in his BioShares Biotechnology Products ETF, a collection of biotech companies with products on the market, may post 26% median sales growth this year. Yet, a lot of biotech stocks are cheap, despite the growth potential. Celgene CELG, +0.90% and Gilead Sciences GILD, +0.82% trade for price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratios of around 0.75. A PEG ratio below 1-1.5 (depending on the growth rate) suggests a stock is cheap, according to this yardstick developed by investing icon Peter Lynch. The big four — Celgene, Gilead, Amgen AMGN, +0.01% and Biogen — recently traded for only 11 times 2016 earnings, around all-time lows, says Yook. I’ll add that, at some point, we’ll see an end to the worries that have investors in “risk off” mode, an attitude that’s a huge negative for biotech stocks. Assuming, of course, that the U.S. is not going into a recession. That’s my guess. Companies are hiring and consumers aren’t overly burdened with debt, suggesting continued growth without a recession is the most likely scenario. At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. During the past five years, Brush has suggested CELG, GILD, AMGN, BIIB, ACHN and SGMO in his stock newsletter Brush Up on Stocks. Brush is a Manhattan-based financial writer who has covered business for the New York Times and The Economist group, and he attended Columbia Business School in the Knight-Bagehot program.

ACHN,"Getty Images The Nasdaq Composite Index is coming close to recovering from its epic loss when the dot-com bubble burst in 2000. The Nasdaq Composite Index has outperformed the record-setting S&P 500 Index of the largest U.S. stocks this year. And it’s climbing back to its record high set in March 2000, when the dot-com bubble burst. The tech-heavy Nasdaq had fallen so far at the start of the new millennium that it was difficult to imagine it would ever make up lost ground. But as MarketWatch’s Howard Gold discusses today, the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.64%  is close to completing an extraordinary recovery. The index comprises about 2,500 stocks, much fewer than there were in the late 1990s, and has become less beholden to the tech industry. Such shares now make up 44% of the total, down from 57% at the end of 2009. Sorry to say that Apple AAPL, +0.78%  isn’t among the best bets this year, even though a tour de force product rollout impressed investors. Here are the Nasdaq stocks with the best total returns this year: Best-performing Nasdaq stocks of 2014 COMPANY TICKER CLOSING PRICE - Sept. 9 TOTAL RETURN YTD TOTAL RETURN - 3 YEARS TOTAL RETURN - 5 YEARS BioFuel Energy Corp.

PLUG $5.27 240% 208% -26% Total returns assume dividends are reinvested. Source: FactSet As you can see, this year’s best-performing Nasdaq stocks haven’t necessarily been top performers over longer periods. The Nos.1 and 2 this year — BioFuel Energy Corp. US:BIOF  of Denver and the tongue-twisting SinoCoking Coal & Coke Industries Inc. US:SCOK  of Henan Province, China — are five-year losers. BioFuel Energy saw most of its gains earlier this year, including a 132% jump March 30, after the company received a proposal from David Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital and James R. Brickman for a transaction through which BioFuel would acquire JBGL Capital LP and “certain subsidiaries” of JBGL Builder Finance LLC. Greenlight Capital also disclosed it had built up a 35.4% stake in BioFuel. BioFuel agreed to the deal June 10 for a price of $275 million. When adding up the current BioFuel stakes held by Greenlight and Brickman, plus the issuance of new shares to those parties as well as other interests held in BioFuel subsidiaries, Greenlight will end up with a 49.9% stake in BioFuel’s shares, while Brickman will own 8.4%. To further emphasize the high volatility of some Nasdaq stocks, shares of SinoCoking Coal & Coke Industries rose 143% on Tuesday, after the company said it was preparing to begin converting 21 million tons of coal into synthetic gas, which would generate a gross profit of $45 million in 2015. The third-best Nasdaq performer this year is InterMune Inc. US:ITMN  of Brisbane, Calif., a biotech firm that saw its share price rise 171% on Feb, 25, after saying results for a phase III study of its pirfenidone medication showed a significant reduction over a 52-week period for patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. Pirfenidone is the only treatment for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis approved anywhere in the world, according to InterMune, and it’s marketed in the European Union and in Canada under the Esbriet brand. On Aug. 24, InterMune agreed to be acquired by Roche Holding AG RHHBY, -0.61%  of Basel, Switzerland, for $74 a share in cash, or roughly $8.3 billion. This sent InterMune’s shares up 35% the following day. Ranking fourth is Pacific Ethanol Inc. PEIX, +6.19%  of Sacramento, Calif., which has risen steadily since May, after pulling back from a peak of $18 in early April. The stock rose 65% on Feb. 27, after the company reported a fourth-quarter gross profit of $21.6 million, compared to a loss of $4.7 million a year earlier. More recently, second-quarter gross profit came in at $33.6 million, rising from $7 million a year earlier. Cellular Biomedicine Group Inc. CBMG, -3.84%  of Palo Alto, Calif., is next. The shares shot up 176% during June, when they began trading on the Nasdaq market. Other positive developments during June included positive results from a six-month phase I/IIa clinical trial of the company’s Rejoin treatment for osteoarthritis of the knee, and a $10 million common-share offering to private investors. More recently, the shares have dropped following Cellular Biomedicine Group’s announcement July 31 that the exit from its legacy consulting business would cost the company $840,000. It agreed Aug. 4 to acquire Agreen Biotech Co. Ltd. China for $3.28 million in cash and stock. Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc. ICPT, +2.28%  of New York has seen its shares soar 315% this year. The main action was Jan. 9, when the shares nearly tripled after the company said it had stopped a trial of its obeticholic acid (OCA) treatment for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, because an interim analysis showed “that the primary endpoint of the trial [had] been met.” Shares of RadNet Inc. RDNT, +3.97%  of Los Angeles have tripled this year. The stock gained 21% Aug. 8 after the outpatient diagnostic imaging services provider raised its guidance for 2014 revenue to a range of $705 million to $735 million from a previous forecast of $700 million to $730 million. RadNet also said its second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes, amortization and depreciation (EBITDA) was up 11% from a year earlier to $33.4 million. Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ACHN, +0.00%  of New Haven, Conn., is up 273% this year, with the shares climbing steadily since the middle of August. The stock surged 171% during June. Two catalysts were the lifting of the Food and Drug Administration’s hold on Achillion’s trials of its Sovaprevir medication for treating hepatitis C, and speculation that the company could be a takeout target, after Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc., a rival hepatitis C developer, agreed to be acquired by Merck & Co. MRK, -1.13% Identiv Inc. INVE, +1.63%  of Fremont, Calif., makes secure identification systems for physical and computer access control. A flurry of new-product launches led to a 23% increase in second-quarter revenue to $22.3 million, while gross profit rose 5% to $8.9 million, with the profit margin declining “primarily due to product mix.” The company is still running at a loss, as it focuses on expansion. On Wednesday, Identiv proposed a public offering of common shares, but didn’t say how much money it was trying to raise. The shares were down 10% in aftermarket trading. Rounding out the list of the 10 best-performing Nasdaq stocks this year is Plug Power Inc. PLUG, -1.05%  of Latham, N.Y., which makes fuel cells that can replace batteries in fork lifts and material-handling vehicles. The stock has pulled back from a high of $10.31 on March 10. The stock had risen 62% over two days, along with the stocks of fuel-cell competitors, before sinking 42% on March 11 and giving up more than it had gained the previous two sessions. Speculation appeared to run rampant, after Plug Power said Feb. 26 it had received a large order for 1,738 GenDrive fuel-cell units from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, +1.37% along with a lucrative six-year service contract. Plug Power’s second-quarter revenue totaled $17.3 million, more than doubling from $7.5 million a year earlier. The company’s operating loss rose slightly to $6.6 million. On the next page, find out about Nasdaq bargain stocks.

ACHN,"Bloomberg NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — Stocks ended mixed Friday, trimming or erasing losses after falling on news of a clash between Ukrainian and Russian military units on Ukraine soil. Major indexes posted weekly gains despite the late flight out of riskier assets into Treasurys. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  fell 0.12 point, or less than 0.1%, to end at 1,955.06 after trading as low as 1,941.40, leaving the index with a 1.2% weekly gain. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  trimmed a triple-digit loss to end the day down 50.67 points, or 0.3%, at 16,662.91, making for a weekly rise of 0.7%. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.64%  returned to positive territory, rising 11.93 points, or 0.3%, to 4,464.93 and notching a 2.2% weekly advance. Ukrainian forces destroyed part of a Russian military unit that was on Ukrainian soil, a Ukrainian military spokesperson said Friday, according to news reports. Separately, NATO’s secretary-general said the alliance observed a Russian “incursion” into Ukraine, denied by Russia, on Thursday night, according to the Associated Press. “Markets are reacting this afternoon to the ongoing developments, but in the fog of war it makes little difference what the specific elements are in each event. Instead, what drives market valuations is the knowledge of applied costs. No matter how Ukraine, Russia, and the separatists sort themselves out, the costs continue to rise,” said David Kotok, chief investment officer at Cumberland Advisors, in a note. The 10-year Treasury note yield US:10_YEAR fell more than 5 basis points to less than 2.35% as investors sought safety by buying Treasurys. Yields fall as Treasury prices decline. Haven-related buying only provided a modicum of help for gold, however, which trimmed losses but still settled at its lowest level since Aug. 5. Friday’s losses on the main benchmarks put a cap on weekly gains. Stocks trimmed initial losses ahead of the closing bell. John De Clue, chief investment officer at the Private Client Reserve of U.S. Bank, said he isn’t surprised that stocks have been so resilient in the face of geopolitical concerns. “Second-quarter earnings have been better than many of us expected and the economy is growing. The fact that we are not seeing larger pullbacks mean that investors are not alarmed by the impact of geopolitical issues,” he said. Still, the entanglement overshadowed more signs that the U.S. economy remains healthy and that company profits are increasing. Industrial production rose in July, thanks to a sizable jump in car output, the Federal Reserve said Friday. Meanwhile, U.S. producer prices inched up in July, a second consecutive month of gains, led by services such as transportation and warehousing, the government reported Friday. That is one of several recent inflation gauges that show price growth isn’t running too hot for the Fed. Investors shrugged off a preliminary August reading on the University of Michigan/Thomson Reuters consumer-sentiment index that showed it at the lowest level since November.

It didn’t take much to rejuvenate this strong bull, though. A couple of days of pullback, plus some sideways action seemed to have done it. Then, today Janet Yellen basically signaled that the Fed was keeping the status quo despite what some people worried was creeping inflation (based on yesterday’s Consumer Price report). That was enough to bring in heavy buying this afternoon, which pushed the market to new highs, at least in terms of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index SPX, +1.38% and several other major indexes (but not the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% ).

ACHN,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc. said Tuesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has removed the clinical hold on sovaprevir, the company’s experimental hepatitis C treatment. Shares surged 47% to $6.24 in early trading. The news comes amid heightened interest in makers of hepatitis C drugs, as the pharmaceutical industry bets that improved medicines for the liver disease represent a large, long-term market opportunity. Illustrating that demand, Merck & Co. MRK, -1.13%   on Monday agreed to acquire Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. US:IDIX  , a developer of hepatitis C drugs, for $24.50 a share in cash, more than triple the stock’s Friday closing price of $7.23. Achillion ACHN, +0.00%  , for its part, has also been seen a takeover candidate. In a note to clients, JMP Securities said that Merck’s planned acquisition of Idenix leaves Achillion as “the only unencumbered, clinical-stage, HCV nucleotide-analog company,” with several potential acquirers in the wings. The firm went so far as to put a $13 per-share, or $1.5 billion, price tag on Achillion, assuming a premium for intellectual property and expertise in nucleotide-analog development.

ACHN,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — U.S. stock futures fell sharply on Monday as investors faced the growing likelihood of a shutdown of the U.S. government, while political worries in Italy and a downbeat Chinese manufacturing survey also weighed on sentiment. Futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJZ3 slumped 137 points, or 0.9%, to 15,058, while those for the Standard & Poor’s US:SPZ3  slid 15.30 points, or 0.9%, to 1,671. Futures for the Nasdaq 100 index US:NDZ3  dropped 26 points, or 0.8%, to 3,197. White House Releases Animated Explanation of ObamaCare Concerns about the budget standoff in Congress spooked investors. The U.S. government moved closer to a shutdown after the Republican-controlled House of Representatives passed a funding bill over the weekend that included a one-year delay to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and the repeal of a tax that would pay for it. The measure now goes to the Democrat-controlled Senate, where it’s expected to get rejected. If a spending bill is not passed by Monday night, then a partial government shutdown means thousands of government workers go on furlough. It also raises questions as to whether the week’s biggest piece of data — the monthly jobs report — will be released on Friday. “As we’ve seen in the past, the months leading up to the deadline are simply seen as an opportunity for both sides to gain political points, while making a villain out of the opposition,” said Craig Erlam, market analyst at Alpari U.K., in a note. “It’s only in the final 24 hours that any actual progress tends to be made. We can only hope that this is what we’re seeing again.” The Chicago purchasing managers index is due at 9:45 a.m. Eastern time. U.S. stocks posted their first weekly drop since August at the close of last week, and investors are still nervous about what the political impasse bodes for the debt ceiling. Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew has said Congress must act to raise the debt limit before Oct. 17 or the government runs out of ways to pay its bills. Read: Fret the debt ceiling, not shutdown Tension came from across the pond as well. The Italian government was thrown into chaos after former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi’s party said all five of its cabinet members will resign. An effort was underway to avoid snap elections in the country, but European stocks felt the double pressure of the looming U.S. shutdown and Italian worries. Asian stocks sold off after a report from HSBC showed a drop in the final estimate of the China Purchasing Managers’ Index to 50.2 in September from a preliminary reading of 51.2. The August reading was 50.1, and analysts said the fresh data could mean economic growth slowed in late September. J.C.

ACHN,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ACHN, +0.00% said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has put a clinical hold on sovaprevir, its experimental oral hepatitis C treatment, due to safety concerns. Shares, which were halted briefly on the news, dropped 22% to $6.50 in after-hours trading. The FDA put the drug on clinical hold after Achillion's early-stage study of drug interactions in healthy patients resulted in elevated liver enzymes tied to higher-than-expected exposures to sovaprevir and another drug, atazanavir. The company had voluntarily stopped dosing in the study after finding high levels of the liver enzymes in several people enrolled in the study. Its preliminary investigation found that dosing with both of the drugs caused a metabolic interaction that substantially increased the plasma concentration of both drugs. No serious adverse events were reported. The FDA has continued to allow the enrollment of patients in a separate mid-stage study evaluating sovaprevir in combination with other drugs in patients with hepatitis C. Achillion is competing with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +1.09% and Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, +0.82% to bring an all-oral hepatitis C regimen to market, hoping to capitalize on what is expected to be a multibillion-dollar market for the therapy.

ACHN,"Even though the stock market is showing signs of wear and tear, there are still some stocks making moves and breaking out. Here are five to watch: Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ACHN, +0.00%  is in a beautiful, multi-year rising channel that's taken it from 1.00 to 12.00. It pulled back at the beginning of last year, rallied, pulled back, and from August to November rallied from 5.50 up to 11. It came back down and tested key support. The trendline held, and as it moved up, the bottom of the trendline, that line formed a wedge or coiling-type pattern with the rising tops line. On Wednesday, the stock popped 63 cents to 10.81, or 6.7%, on 1.7 million shares. The near-term target is up around 11.25, and the secondary target is up at the top of the mid-range channel at 14.25. Arris Group Inc. ARRS, +1.14%  has a nice long channel as well. The angle of ascent has steepened since mid-Oct and accelerated. The stock popped in December, popped in January, and on Wednesday, it cleanly broke out of the declining tops line of the entire two-year consolidation, up 36 cents to 16.95, or 2% on 2.5 million shares. It's not a big gain, although it did close 18-19 cents off the high. It has a short-term target at 18, then secondary target at 19.50. Mitek Systems Inc. MITK, +2.07%  is continuing five consecutive days up. On Wednesday, it popped another 19 cents to 4.93, or 4%, on over 700,000 shares traded. Good volume for this stock. It appears that a major head-and-shoulders bottom pattern has been broken. The stock retested the trendline, which held, and has since had nice three-wave move up. There could be some pushback between 5.10 and 5.40, where it appears headed. If it gets through there, this stock could spike up to the 6.50 range, which is the next major resistance. The underlying technicals, such as on-balance volume, balance of power, and money stream are increasing, which is what you want to see when a stock is recovered. Pharmacyclics Inc. US:PCYC  had a special day on Wednesday, as major resistance was broken. The stock popped out of a three-week consolidation and ran up 6.66 to 77.03, or 9.5%, on 1.4 million shares. That was the biggest volume on an up-day going back several months. Look for a test of 80 short-term, secondary target in the high 80s, and on the long-term pattern, look for it to get up to over 100. Proto Labs Inc. PRLB, +2.75%  also had a big day on Wednesday. Over the last year a big base has developed. The stock popped out a month ago, pulled back in a nice, little wedge, and that wedge was broken on Tuesday, but it didn't close well. Then on Wednesday, it gapped up and ran, closing at the high end of the range, up 10.82 to 52.82, or 25.76%, on 3.1 million shares. That's a superior breakout day. It's in new post-IPO high territory, and at this point, it may continue to run into the high 50s, and then low 60s. See Harry's video chart analysis on these stocks.

ACHN,"Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ACHN, +0.00% said it achieved positive proof-of-concept results for its hepatitis C drug, allowing it to move forward with its clinical trials of the drug. Shares rose 6.3% premarket to $10.13. As of Wednesday's close, the stock was up 25% so far this year. Achillion is among a handful of companies racing to bring an all-oral regimen for hepatitis C to the market. The new drugs being developed would eliminate an injectable drug used in the current standard treatment, interferon, which can be difficult for patients to tolerate. Major players working on new hepatitis C drugs include Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, +0.82% and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +1.09% Following positive results from a Phase 1a trial for its ACH-3102 drug, Achillion has initiated a pilot Phase 2 trial evaluating the drug. The company said the drug showed ""robust antiviral activity"" in its trial. ACH-3102 received fast-track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May. Hepatitis C is a viral disease that attacks the liver, and it is believed to afflict about 180 million world-wide, with more than four million in the U.S., according to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. One research firm has estimated that the world-wide hepatitis C market could reach $16 billion in 2015, up from $1.7 billion in 2010. Last month, Achillion, which focuses on discovery and development of infectious disease treatments, said its second-quarter loss widened slightly as the company posted higher operating expenses and no revenue.

ACHN,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Shares of Idenix Pharmaceuticals idix plunged 30% to $5.96 Thursday on news that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has partially halted a Phase II clinical trial for its drug IDX184 over safety concerns. Idenix has been testing the product for the treatment of the hepatitis C virus, or HCV. The FDA placed a 'partial hold' on the trial pending the evaluation of reports that a patient in a clinical trial for a rival compound had suffered a severe cardiac event. The FDA has requested that Idenix provide additional patient data to help the agency with its evaluation. IDX184 belongs to a newer class of HCV drugs known as nucleotides. Earlier this month, shares of rival Bristol-Myers Squibb BMS, +1.75% slid almost 10% after the company announced it had suspended a Phase II study of its HCV nucleotide agent due to concerns that a patient had developed heart failure.

ACHN,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) — Bristol-Myers Squibb’s bad news that its hepatitis C drug INX-189 might be a dud is good news for rival drug developers, analysts said Thursday. Late Wednesday, Bristol BMY, +1.09%  announced that INX-189, also known as BMS-094, had exhibited “a serious safety issue” during a Phase II clinical trial, prompting the drug maker to suspend the study until further notice. Analysts said they believe the safety issue related to a patient developing heart failure while taking a very high dose of the drug. Small Investors Should Be Furious at Stock Market INX-189 was acquired by Bristol through its $2.5 billion takeover of Inhibitix earlier this year in an effort to expand its footprint in the potentially lucrative market for hepatitis C, or HCV. Adding insult to injury on Thursday was the fact that a key reason Bristol paid a 160% premium for Inhibitex was to gain access to INX-189, which belongs to a promising new class of HCV drugs known as nucleotides. Shares of Bristol-Myers closed down nearly 9% at $32.55 Thursday afternoon. News that INX-189 had run aground stoked trading in shares of Gilead Sciences GILD, +0.82% which is developing a rival nucleotide known as GS-7977, currently in Phase III testing. Last year Gilead paid $11 billion for GS-7977’s developer, Pharmasset, to expand its HCV pipeline. Shares of Gilead closed up 7% at $57.29. In addition to being nucleotides, INX-189 and GS-7977 are also orally administered, adding to their attraction. Until recently, most HCV patients were treated with drugs that were either injected or administered by IV. Bristol’s bad news is definitely a plus for Gilead, according to analysts, and could also benefit fellow HCV developers Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX, +2.13% Achillion Pharmaceuticals ACHN, +0.00%  and Idenix Pharmaceuticals IDIX “Of all the nucleotides in play, BMS-094 had represented the most formidable threat to Gilead’s dominance within HCV,” Barclays analyst Anthony Butler wrote in a note. “Although Vertex’s ALS-2200 has shown similar potency to GS-7977, Vertex remains at least two years behind (potential launch in 2017), leaving Gilead ample time to flex their muscle. In addition, given the amount of data we have seen thus far with GS-7977, we remain confident there should be no major negative safety surprises,” Butler said, upgrading Gilead to overweight, with a price target of $65 a share. Wells Fargo analyst Brian Abrahams said that HCV drug developers Vertex and Achillion would also benefit if INX-189 flopped “We see positive read-throughs as well to Vertex, who just reported positive proof-of-concept data from nucleotide ALS-2200, as a failure of 189 would increase the scarcity value of the nucleotide class,” he wrote. “We see positive implications for Achillion, both through the setback to a competitor as well as the possibility that if 189 is ultimately discontinued, Bristol-Myers could seek other HCV assets to codevelop with their remaining agents such as those in Achillion’s portfolio,” Abrahams added. Shares of Vertex closed up about 1% on Thursday, while Achillion shares rose 2%. Meanwhile, shares of Idenix Pharmaceuticals IDIX which is developing its own nucleotide drug, IDX184, were down 3%. The company priced its stock offering early Thursday at $8 a share, a 3.8% discount from Wednesday closing price. But even if INX-189 is scrapped, Bristol may not be in a position to blow billions more on another HCV drug company. “Bristol-Myers may still attempt to form alliances with external companies (e.g., Vertex, Idenix, etc.), but its once-enviable place as a close second-place competitor in the HCV race cannot be easily recovered in our view,” according to Butler. “Bristol-Myers likely needs to perform another acquisition, though with its recent spend on Amylin AMLN  and Inhibitex, its financial flexibility may have been reduced,” the Barclays analyst said, downgrading Bristol to equal weight, with a price target of $33 a share. Bernstein analyst Geoff Porges, meanwhile, thinks that if INX-189 turns out to be a dud, Bristol could pursue a collaboration with another HCV drug developer, including Gilead, “despite the disinterest Gilead has shown in such negotiations,” he wrote in his note. “Other than Bristol, large players in the hepatitis field without nucleotides (Merck MRK, -1.13% Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% ) are likely to increase their interest in other drug classes, as well as energizing their discussions with remaining nucleotide players,” he said. Porges maintained his market-perform rating on Gilead, with a price target of $63 a share, and an outperform rating on Vertex, with a price target of $77.

ACHN,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) — Hepatitis C drug stocks were back in play Thursday after Gilead Sciences and Idenix Pharmaceuticals rolled out promising data for their experimental drugs at a major medical meeting in Europe. Gilead GILD, +0.82%   shares were up 12% at $52.12 in midday trading, in the wake of positive data for its late-stage drug candidate GS-7977, which it recently acquired through its $11 billion takeover of Pharmasset Inc. Investors were particularly intrigued by a study of the compound with Bristol-Myers Squibb’s BMY, +1.09%   drug daclatasivir. Wall Street has become increasingly enamored of hepatitis C drug makers who have been working to develop more effective, orally-administered therapies to help cure the potentially deadly liver disease. Currently, hepatitis C is treated with drugs such as ribavirin in combination with interferon, an injected drug that can cause flu-like symptoms. The regimen can also be extremely long, up to 48 weeks, and generally yields only about a 50% cure rate. Read more on hepatitis C drugs. Idenix IDIX   shares were also on the move, bouncing as high as $9.25 in the morning before settling in at $7.97, up about 2%. Earlier Thursday, Idenix reported positive Phase I clinical data for its drug candidate IDX719. The company also has a compound in later-stage development called IDX184, which belongs to the same class of drugs as GS-7977. But Idenix’s and Gilead’s good news was bad news for Achillion Pharmaceuticals ACHN, +0.00% at least in the minds of investors, who pushed down shares nearly 20% to $8.00 on fears that Achillion’s drug candidates would now be less attractive to potential commercial partners or acquirers. Wells Fargo analyst Brian Abrahams said the sell-off was too harsh. “Today’s data does not change our view that Achillion’s agents will likely find a place in future all-oral (drug) paradigm and enable the company to capture some meaningful revenues in this major market. We would be buyers on today’s weakness,” wrote Abrahams, in his note Thursday.

ACHN,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Investors tantalized by a recent string of lucrative takeover offers for hepatitis C drug-developers shouldn’t assume that an eye-popping bid for Idenix Pharmaceuticals and Achillion Pharmaceuticals is just around the corner, according to biotech analysts. Both Idenix IDIX  and Achillion ACHN, +0.00%  were put in play earlier this month by news that Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY, +1.09%   intends to buy Inhibitex Inc. INHX   for $2.5 billion in cash.The offer represents a dazzling 163% premium over Inhibitex’s pre-bid closing price. Pfizer's Post-Lipitor World Bristol’s bid also comes on the heels of two other lucrative takeovers in the hepatitis C virus, or HCV, arena. In October, Roche RHHBY, -0.61%   announced it was paying a stunning 256% premium, or $230 million, for tiny Anadys Pharmaceuticals. That was followed by Gilead Sciences’s GILD, +0.82%   whopping $11 bid for Pharmasset Inc., which carried an 89% premium. Rumors have since swirled that other Big Pharma players are likewise eyeing the HCV space. And that speculation has helped push up Idenix shares by a hefty 80% and Achillion shares by 45% since the beginning of the year. At stake is a market filled with a backlog of under-treated HCV patients that many analysts believe could reach $10 billion a year within the next five years. But here’s the kicker -- because the new HCV drugs can actually cure the disease, their demand will likely drop over time after the backlog of patients is treated. Despite this, most analysts agree the market should be able to coast along at the $10 billion level for at least ten years. And because time is of the essence, companies with HCV drug candidates in mid-to-late stage development have been considered the hottest takeover targets. TimeAchillion Pharmaceuticals Inc.15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:ACHN $3.0 $3.5 $4.0 Of the two companies, Idenix’s stock has seen the most action largely because its lead drug candidate hails from a highly-touted class of drugs called nucleotides, or “nukes.” Both Inhibitex’s and Pharmasset’s lead drug candidates are nukes, which is what made them particularly attractive acquisitions. “I don’t think Idenix’s stock’s bid too high,” said Wedbush Securities analyst Duane Nash, who tracks Idenix. “But the caveat is that acquisitions generally take longer than most people anticipate.” While Wedbush currently has Idenix’s fair market value listed at $15 a share, Nash believes that Idenix could fetch a takeout price of between $20 and $25 a share. The stock closed at $13.39 on Tuesday. William Blair analyst Katherine Xu, meanwhile, said she believes Idenix’s current takeout range is probably between $15 and $20 a share. Xu currently has a price target of $10 on the stock. Xu added that she could be raising her target into the mid-to-high teens if and when U.S. regulators give the green light to an Idenix’s clinical trial that has been placed on partial hold over safety concerns. The decision is expected within the next few weeks. “I doubt people will take it out before the hold is removed,” she said. But analysts also point out that Novartis AG’s NVS, -0.49%   roughly 30% equity stake in Idenix could hinder a takeover bid, especially as the Swiss pharmaceutical giant reportedly has options to some key drug candidates. Meanwhile, JMP Securities analyst Liisa Bayko thinks that investors have overvalued Idenix’s nuke drug candidate, which she says isn’t as potent as those being developed by Inhibitex and Pharmasset. Because of this, Bayko has a sell rating on the stock. As for Achillion, the reason its shares haven’t been bid up as high as Idenix’s is largely because its lead drug candidate is a protease inhibitor, a class of drugs that includes Merck & Co.’s MRK, -1.13%   Victrelis and Vertex Pharmaceuticals’s VRTX, +2.13%   Incivek, which were both launched last year. Several other drug developers already have protease inhibitors in their pipelines. Xu said that while she currently has Achillion’s price target at $15 a share, its takeout range is probably between $15 and $20. The stock closed at $11.09 on Tuesday. “I think it’s still undervalued at the moment,” she said. Wells Fargo Securities analyst Brian Abrahams said that even though Achillion’s lead drug candidate isn’t a nucleotide, that doesn’t mean it isn’t an attractive acquisition target. “Certainly nucleotides are an exciting class but they’re not the only class we believe will be used in HCV treatment,” said Abrahams, adding that doctors will be looking to use the drugs in combination to get the best results. “Achillion only needs to get a relatively small segment of the market for it to be meaningful to a company of its size,” he added.

ACHN,"--Shares of two players developing hepatitis C treatments jump after news of peer being acquired --Bristol-Myers is paying a 163% premium to acquire Inhibitex --Analysts say significant interest remains for hepatitis C-focused biotech companies NEW YORK -(MarketWatch)- Shares of hepatitis C drug developers Idenix Pharmaceuticals Inc. IDIX and Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc. ACHN, +0.00% jumped sharply after Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. BMY, +1.09% over the weekend agreed to pay a high premium to acquire another player in the category. Drug maker Bristol-Myers agreed to pay $26 a share, or about $2.5 billion, to acquire Inhibitex Inc. (INHX), paying a 163% premium to become a bigger player in the growing business of treating the potentially fatal virus. The bid came as companies race to develop, or acquire, more-effective drugs that can be taken for shorter periods with fewer side effects. The deal raised interest in other players developing hepatitis C treatments: Shares of Idenix jumped 35% to $9.51 in recent trading, and Achillion's stock rose 11% to $8.79. It was the highest level both stocks have traded at since 2007. Analysts say the news should bring significant merger-and-acquisition interest for remaining innovative hepatitis C-focused biotech companies, most notably Idenix and Achillion. Leerink Swann Research said that while Bristol-Myers's takeover of Inhibitex is less than the $11 billion valuation of Pharmasset Inc. VRUS which Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD, +0.82% agreed to acquire in November, ""it's still likely unprecedented for an early Phase II asset."" The firm said the Bristol-Myers deal leaves Idenix and Achillion as the only acquirable assets in their respective classes. Idenix's market capitalization is roughly $918 million, while Achillion's is $614 million. Idenix earlier Monday also disclosed positive interim data from a clinical trial of its lead hepatitis C drug candidate and said it is advancing its hepatitis C development pipeline. Idenix says more than an estimated 170 million people worldwide are chronically infected with hepatitis C. Under a development and commercialization agreement with Novartis AG (NVS, NOVN.VX) signed in May 2003, Idenix launched hepatitis B drug candidate telbivudine, which is sold on the market as Tyzeka/Sebivo. Idenix has three other treatments in the pipeline, as well as additional nucleotide inhibitors. Achillion--which has five hepatitis C treatments in development, including one compound in Phase 2--on Monday said the 12-week treatment of ACH-1625 was safe and well tolerated. The company said it now plans to research the Phase 2 treatment in combination with other oral antiviral agents for the treatment of all hepatitis C genotypes. Not all analysts were buying into the rally. Brean Murray Carret & Co. analyst Brian Skorney wrote in a note that Idenix's effort in the space ""will ultimately yield results that do not match what we have become accustomed to"" from others. Skorney affirmed his sell rating and $3 price target on the stock.

ACHN,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Home Inns & Hotels rallied more than 60% Thursday after pricing above its range as China deals took center stage both here and overseas. With the world's richest IPO from Industrial & Commercial Bank of China dominating the global scene with its $22 billion trading debut on Friday in Shanghai, a much smaller IPO from China has kicked off in the United States. Home Inns & Hotels Management Inc. HMIN priced 3.95 million American depositary receipts at $13.80 a share, raising $109 million. The stock opened at $22 and finished the session at $22.52, up 63%. The China-based hotel chain priced above its $10-$12 range in a sign of strong investor interest with underwriters Credit Suisse Securities, Merrill Lynch and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. Yunxin Mei, co-chairman of Home Inns, rang the opening bell at the Nasdaq to celebrate the IPO. The company traces its roots to 2001 to address growing demand in China for lodging at the economy class level. Home Inns has quickly grown to 82 hotels in 26 cities in China. ""Home Inns' ...IPO will help the company finance its aggressive expansion plans as it opens new hotels and builds its brand in 100 cities in China,"" Renaissance Capital said in its IPO of the week column. See IPO of the week. Home Inns marks the second China IPO of the fall after New Oriental Education EDU, +1.62% debuted Sept. 7 at $15 a share, above its $11-$13 range. The stock has since gained 66% as of Wednesday's close. Industrial & Commercial Bank of China gets ready Friday's $22 billion IPO from Industrial & Commercial Bank of China marks the third and largest of the big four government-owned banks to go public overseas after China Construction Bank and Bank of China. None of the three plan to list their shares in the U.S. because of stricter regulations on the Nasdaq and the NYSE and the Sarbanes-Oxley rules, said Mark Roppel, managing partner of corporate mergers and acquisitions in Beijing for Cadwalader, Wickersham and Taft LLP. Although investors won't be able to buy stock on U.S. exchange, institutional interest from the U.S. and other firms outside of China is strong, with overseas investors gobbling up all but about 10% of the stock. Yet, the investment in the bank could be risky because of a high rate of bad loans disclosed by the bank, he said. ""People just want to be in China because of growth in the economy,"" Roppel said. ""They expect the currency to go up."" Goldman Sachs GS, +1.00% holds a roughly 6% stake in the ICBC worth about $8 billion, he said. In addition, Merrill Lynch MER, -2.35% won the berth as one of the principal underwriters of the deal. ICBC will emerge as one of the largest banks in the world, he said. Although it probably won't play a role the advisory business in global mergers and acquisitions targeting U.S. firms, it could help finance such transactions, he said. After ICBC goes public only one of the big four China banks will remain, China Agricultural Bank. But the lender is reported to have a more serious problem with bad loans than other banks, he said.

ACHN,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the notes to those financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve significant risks and uncertainties. As a result of many important factors, such as those set forth in Part I, Item 1A. ""Risk Factors"" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Overview We are a science-driven, patient-focused biopharmaceutical company seeking to leverage our believed strengths across the continuum from discovery through commercialization by discovering and developing small molecule therapeutics to meet the needs of patients with complement-mediated diseases. We have discovered and developed our complement inhibitor platform, directed at advancing small molecule compounds that have the potential to be used in the treatment of immune-related diseases associated with the alternative pathway of the complement system. The complement system is a part of the human innate immune system and is believed to be comprised of three pathways: the alternative pathway, the lectin pathway and the classical pathway. We are advancing novel small molecules from this platform which target complement factor D, an essential protein within the amplification loop of the alternative pathway. Experts believe the alternative pathway plays a critical role in a number of disease conditions including rare orphan conditions such as C3 glomerulopathy, or C3G, and immune complex membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, or IC-MPGN, both kidney diseases, paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, or PNH, a blood disorder, as well as several more prevalent indications. Our lead drug candidate, ACH-4471, has demonstrated preliminary clinical proof-of-concept in patients with C3G and in patients with PNH. In interim data from the first two patients enrolled in our phase II clinical trial for C3G patients, ACH-4471 demonstrated reductions in proteinuria, a marker of renal dysfunction, as well as reductions in biomarkers associated with the over-activation of the complement alternative pathway characteristic of patients with C3G. In interim data from the first four patients enrolled in our phase II clinical trial for PNH patients, ACH-4471 demonstrated reductions in lactate dehydrogenase, or LDH, a marker of intravascular hemolysis, increases in hemoglobin, and improvements in fatigue score. We believe that our alternative pathway factor D inhibitor compounds may have a pharmacological advantage by potentially preventing extravascular hemolysis, or the destruction of PNH red blood cells outside of blood vessels, while also preventing intravascular hemolysis, or red blood cell destruction within blood vessels. In addition, we believe our alternative pathway factor D inhibitor compounds may be able to treat the proportion of patients with PNH who have a suboptimal response to, or who fail to respond to, currently approved treatments for PNH. We have also generated a platform of additional potent and specific orally-administered compounds that bind to factor D with high affinity, resulting in alternative pathway inhibition. One of these compounds, ACH-5228, is in phase I clinical testing in healthy volunteers, and additional compounds are in IND-enabling preclinical development. We may seek to advance certain of these factor D inhibitors for oral systemic administration to treat C3G, IC-MPGN, PNH, or other complement mediated diseases. We were incorporated on August 17, 1998 in Delaware. Since our inception, we have spent substantial research and development funds to develop our drug candidate pipeline and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We have incurred losses of $588.8 million from inception through December 31, 2017 and Table of Contents had an accumulated deficit of $602.7 million as of December 31, 2017, which includes preferred stock dividends recognized until our initial public offering in 2006. Our net losses were $85.2 million, $61.7 million, and $5.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively. We have funded our operations primarily through proceeds from the sale of equity securities. Through December 31, 2017, we have received approximately $932.4 million in aggregate gross proceeds from stock issuances, including convertible preferred stock, our initial public offering, private placements of our common stock, registered offerings of our common stock and an equity investment by a former collaboration partner. We expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we seek to continue preclinical and clinical development of certain complement inhibitors drug candidates. We will need substantial additional financing to obtain regulatory approvals, fund operating losses, and, if deemed appropriate, establish manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities for our complement inhibitor program, which we will seek to raise through public or private equity or debt financings, collaborative or other arrangements with third parties or through other sources of financing. There can be no assurance that such funds will be available on terms favorable to us, if at all. In addition to the risks associated with being an early-stage drug development company, there can be no assurance that we or any future collaborators will successfully advance or complete our research and development programs, obtain adequate patent protection for our technology, obtain necessary government regulatory approval for drug candidates we develop, find and maintain appropriate collaboration partners or that any approved drug candidates will be commercially viable. In addition, we may not be profitable even if we or any future collaborators succeed in commercializing any of our drug candidates. Recent Development-Restructuring In February 2018, we implemented a restructuring plan that will reduce employee headcount by approximately 20% to approximately 70 employees in March 2018. The restructuring plan was implemented following a strategic assessment of our portfolio. During the assessment, our management team and board of directors concluded that our strategic focus would be on the development of our existing clinical candidates, ACH-4471 and ACH-5228, and late-stage preclinical compound, ACH-5548. We assessed the staffing levels required to accomplish our revised strategic goals and determined to reduce our staff across several functional areas, while retaining the biology and chemistry core strengths necessary to advance our complement factor D portfolio. Collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. On September 9, 2017, we received notice from Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Janssen, of Janssen's termination, effective as of November 8, 2017, of our exclusive collaboration and license agreement with them, which we refer to as the Janssen Agreement. Under the terms of the Janssen Agreement, we had granted Janssen exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products that contained one or more of our drug candidates for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus, or HCV, namely odalasvir, a second-generation NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3422, a NS5B HCV nucleoside polymerase inhibitor, and sovaprevir, a NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor. Janssen terminated the Janssen Agreement under section 14.6 of the Janssen Agreement, which allows for unilateral termination at Janssen's discretion upon 60 days' written notice to us at any time prior to the submission of the first application for marketing approval for a licensed product in any of the major market countries specified in the Janssen Agreement. Pursuant to its notice of termination, Janssen informed us that with an increasing number of effective therapies addressing medical need in hepatitis C, Janssen had made a strategic decision to discontinue the development of JNJ-4178, a three-drug combination regimen that contained one of Table of Contents our HCV product candidates that we licensed to Janssen under the Janssen Agreement. Following the termination, all licenses granted by either party to the other under the Janssen Agreement terminated, except to the extent necessary to allow either party to perform any obligations or exercise rights that survive the termination. As a result of the termination of the Janssen Agreement, we will not receive any future milestone-based or royalty payments under that agreement, and Janssen will not bear the future costs of developing and commercializing our HCV portfolio. We currently have no plans to advance the HCV program on our own. Financial Operations Overview Revenue To date, we have not generated any revenue from the commercial sale of any drugs. During the year ended December 31, 2017 we did not recognize any revenue. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we recognized revenue of $15.0 million and $66.1 million, respectively, under the Janssen Agreement which was terminated effective November 8, 2017. Pursuant to the terms of the Janssen Agreement, we were required to provide technology transfer services related to the chemistry, manufacturing and know-how to Janssen for up to 180 days after the effective date of the Janssen Agreement. We completed this transfer in December 2015. We determined that the amount received in excess of the fair value of our common stock upon issuance to JJDC of $66.1 million of our common stock was attributed to the license and technology services and straight-line attribution of the license and technology services revenues would be used to recognize revenue. As such, revenue of $66.1 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with this transaction. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized revenue of $15.0 million under the Janssen Agreement due to the achievement of a clinical enrollment milestone. As a result of the termination of the Janssen Agreement, we will not receive any future milestone-based or royalty payments under that agreement, and Janssen will not bear the future costs of developing and commercializing our HCV portfolio. Research and Development Our research and development expenses reflect costs incurred for our proprietary research and development projects which consist primarily of salaries and benefits for our research and development personnel, costs of services by clinical research organizations, other outsourced research, materials used during research and development activities, facility-related costs such as rent and utilities associated with our laboratory and clinical development space and operating supplies. Our focus is on our complement inhibitor platform, directed at advancing small molecule compounds that have the potential to be used in the treatment of immune-related diseases associated with the alternative pathway of the complement system. The complement system is a part of the human innate immune system and is believed to comprise three pathways: the alternative pathway, the lectin pathway and the classical pathway. We are advancing novel small molecules from this platform which target complement factor D, an essential protein within the amplification loop of the alternative pathway. The alternative pathway is thought to play a critical role in a number of disease conditions including rare orphan conditions such as PNH, a blood disorder, C3G and IC-MPGN, both kidney diseases, as well as several more prevalent indications. In addition to ACH-4471, our lead drug candidate, we have also generated a platform of additional potent and specific orally-administered compounds that bind to factor D with high affinity, resulting in alternative Table of Contents pathway inhibition. One of these compounds, ACH-5228, is in phase I clinical testing in healthy volunteers, and an additional compound, ACH-5548, is in late-stage preclinical development. We may seek to advance certain of these additional factor D inhibitors for oral systemic administration to treat PNH, C3G, IC-MPGN, or other diseases. All costs associated with internal research and development, and research and development services for which we have externally contracted, are expensed as incurred. The costs of obtaining patents for our drug candidates are expensed as incurred as indirect costs. Our research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were as follows:  For the Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 (in thousands) Direct external costs: ACH-4471 $ 17,073 $ 26,347 $ 13,320 ACH-5228 10,844 - - ACH-5548 474 - - Other next generation factor D inhibitors (oral and intravitreal) 8,053 6,276 - HCV compounds and combination trials 87 326 20,956 Other 10 - 47 36,541 32,949 34,323 Direct internal personnel costs 19,746 19,514 17,605 Sub-total direct costs 56,287 52,463 51,928 Indirect costs and overhead 8,600 7,110 5,265 Connecticut research and development tax credit 165 (411 ) (640 ) Total research and development $ 65,052 $ 59,162 $ 56,553  The State of Connecticut provides companies with the opportunity to exchange certain research and development credit carryforwards for cash in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of the research and development credit. The program provides for such exchange of the research and development credit at a rate of 65% of the annual research and development credit. The benefit for such exchange is recorded as a reduction of research and development expenditures. We expect research and development expenses associated with our complement inhibitor program to be substantial and to increase over time. There are numerous existing factors associated with the development and commercialization, if any, of our complement inhibitor program, including future trial design and various regulatory requirements, many of which cannot be determined with accuracy at this time based on our stage of development. Additionally, future commercial and regulatory factors beyond our control will evolve and therefore are expected to impact the development of our complement inhibitor program and plans over time. Following the termination of the Janssen Agreement on November 8, 2017, we are responsible for all expenses associated with our HCV program. Since we have no plans to advance the HCV program on our own, we expect these expenses will be limited to the intellectual property costs related to our HCV compounds. The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of our drug candidates. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs, including the uncertainty of: the scope, rate of progress and expense of our clinical trials and other research and development activities; Table of Contents our ability to market, commercialize and achieve market acceptance for any of our drug candidates that we are developing or may develop in the future; results of future clinical trials that we may conduct; results of clinical trials conducted by our competitors; the terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish; the expense and timing of regulatory approvals; and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of any of our drug candidates would significantly change the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those which we currently anticipate will be required to complete clinical development of a drug candidate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we would be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. General and Administrative Our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for management and administrative personnel, professional fees for legal, accounting and other services, travel costs and facility-related costs such as rent, utilities and other general office expenses. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations set forth below are based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those described below. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. These estimates and assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Management makes estimates and exercises judgment in revenue recognition, research and development costs, stock-based compensation and accrued expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect management's more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements: Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue from contract research and development and research progress payments in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 605, or ASC 605, Revenue Recognition. Revenue-generating research and development collaborations are often multiple element arrangements, providing for a license as well as research and development services. In order to account for these arrangements, we must identify the deliverable included within the arrangement and evaluate which deliverables represent separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met, including whether the delivered element has stand-alone value to the collaborator. The consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are applied to each of the separate units. Table of Contents When we determine that an arrangement should be accounted for as a single unit of accounting, we must determine the period over which the performance obligations will be performed and revenue related to upfront license payments will be recognized. Revenue will be recognized using either a proportionate performance or straight-line method. We recognize revenue using the proportionate performance method provided that we can reasonably estimate the level of effort required to complete our performance obligations under an arrangement and such performance obligations are provided on a best-efforts basis. Under the proportionate performance method, periodic revenue related to up-front license payments is recognized as the percentage of actual effort expended in that period to total effort expected for all of our performance obligations under the arrangement. Actual effort is generally determined based upon actual direct labor hours, or FTEs, incurred and include research and development activities performed by internal scientists. Total expected effort is generally based upon the total projected direct labor hours. Significant management judgment is required in determining the level of effort required under an arrangement and the period over which we expect to complete the related performance obligations. In the event that a change in estimate occurs, the change will be accounted for using the cumulative catch-up method which provides for an adjustment to revenue in the current period. Estimates of our level of effort may change in the future, resulting in a material change in the amount of revenue recognized in future periods, including negative revenue in some periods. Generally, under collaboration arrangements, payments received during the period of performance may include up-front payments, time-or performance-based milestones and reimbursement of internal and external costs. The proportion of actual performance to total expected performance is applied to these payments in determining periodic revenue but will be limited by the aggregate cash received or receivable to date. Substantive milestone payments are recognized upon achievement of the milestone. Determining whether a milestone is substantive requires judgment that should be made at the inception of the arrangement. To meet the definition of a substantive milestone, the consideration earned by achieving the milestone Under the terms of the Janssen Agreement, we granted Janssen exclusive worldwide rights to develop and commercialize products that contained one or more of our drug candidates for the treatment of HCV, namely odalasvir, a second-generation NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3422, a NS5B HCV polymerase inhibitor, and sovaprevir, a NS3/4A HCV protease inhibitor. In May 2015, we also entered into a parallel transaction with Janssen's affiliate, JJDC, Inc., or JJDC, pursuant to which JJDC purchased 18,367,346 shares of our common stock at a price of $12.25 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $225.0 million pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, or the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement. In connection with the purchase of the shares, we and JJDC also entered into an investor agreement, or the Investor Agreement, on July 1, 2015 governing specified rights and obligations of JJDC with respect to its ownership of such shares. Pursuant to the terms of the Janssen Agreement, we were required to provide technology transfer services related to the chemistry, manufacturing and know-how to Janssen for up to 180 days after the effective date of the agreement. In accordance with ASC 605-25, which provides guidance on accounting for multiple-element arrangements, including the determination of the units of accounting and allocation of total arrangement consideration, we identified all of the obligations at the inception of the Janssen Agreement. The significant obligations were determined to be the license and the technology transfer services. We determined that license and technology transfer services represented a single unit of accounting because they were not viewed to have standalone value. The Janssen Agreement entered into by us and Janssen, and the JJDC Stock Purchase Agreement and the Investor Agreement, which were entered into by us and Janssen's affiliate, were entered into in contemplation of each other. The only upfront amount received by us in exchange for the license and technology transfer services and the issuance of the shares was the $225.0 million. We determined that the amount received in excess of the fair value of the shares upon issuance of $66.1 million was attributed to the license and technology services. We also determined that there was no discernable pattern in which the Table of Contents technology services would be provided during the 180 day period after the effective date. In accordance with ASC 605-10, we determined that straight-line attribution of the license and technology services revenues would be used to recognize revenue. As such, revenue of $66.1 million was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2015 associated with this transaction. Under the terms of the Janssen Agreement, we earned a $15.0 million clinical milestone payment in December 2016 and would have been eligible to receive additional milestones in the future. We elected to apply the guidance in ASC 605-28 to the milestones. These milestones, if achieved, were substantive as they would relate solely to past performance and were commensurate with estimated enhancement of value associated with the achievement of each milestone as a result of our performance. On September 9, 2017, we received notice from Janssen of Janssen's termination, effective as of November 8, 2017, of the Janssen Agreement. As a result of the termination of the Janssen Agreement, we will not receive any future milestone-based or royalty payments under that agreement, and Janssen will not bear the future costs of developing and commercializing our HCV portfolio. Stock-Based Compensation-Employee Stock-Based Awards We apply ASC 718, Stock Compensation, which requires measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees and directors, including employee stock options under our stock incentive plans and employee stock purchases under our 2006 ESPP Plan, based on estimated fair values. We primarily grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the market value of the shares at the date of grant. Under the fair value recognition provisions, stock-based compensation cost is based on the value of the portion of stock-based awards that is ultimately expected to vest. We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for stock-based awards. The Black-Scholes model requires the use of assumptions which determine the fair value of the stock-based awards. Determining the fair value of stock-based awards at the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term of stock options, the expected volatility of our stock and expected dividends. We base our estimate of the expected term on historical data for similar stock option grants and we calculate volatility based on actual volatility for the expected term of the option. We estimate forfeitures at the grant date and . . . Feb 22, 2018 (c) 1995-2018 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

ACHN,"NEW HAVEN, Conn., Feb 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- February 28, 2018 is the 11th Annual Rare Disease Day Achillion sponsors initiative to help shine the light on C3G to raise awareness and understanding of this rare, chronic disease affecting the kidneys Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACHN, +0.00% a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing oral small-molecule factor D inhibitors to modulate the complement alternative pathway, today announced the launch of a new patient support initiative called WeC3G(TM), aimed at raising awareness and understanding of C3 glomerulopathy (""C3G"") a rare and chronic disease affecting the kidneys. WeC3G, sponsored by Achillion, is an initiative to connect patients and families living with C3G to information, support, resources, and each other to help to shine the light on C3G. The initial launch includes a program website containing patient and caregiver resources, educational material, a digital toolkit, and the ability to sign up for ongoing news and updates. Milind Deshpande, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Achillion, commented, ""On this Rare Disease Day, Achillion is proud of its sponsorship of WeC3G, along with other recent efforts, such as supporting a global natural history study of C3G to track the course of this disease, and sponsorship of last August's Patient Focused Drug-Development (PFDD) meeting for C3G hosted by the National Kidney Foundation. Achillion is steadfastly committed to innovative research with a goal of addressing unmet medical needs of patients with C3G by advancing potentially disease-modifying therapies."" To learn more, please visit the WeC3G website, http://www.WeC3G.com, or follow WeC3G on Facebook, http://www.facebook.com/wec3g, where patients and caregivers can join the conversation. C3 glomerulopathy (glo-MER-u-LOP-ah-the), or C3G, is a rare, chronic disease in which experts believe that a specific part of the immune system, the alternative pathway of the complement system, is not well controlled, resulting in deposition of C3 protein fragments in the kidney often leading to damage and potential loss of function. It has been estimated that there are approximately 4,000 people in the United States living with C3G, a disease for which there are no approved treatments. Achillion Pharmaceuticals is focused on modulation of the complement system via oral small-molecules that inhibit the alternative pathway (AP), a potentially transformative approach to overcoming a variety of immunological, hematologic and nephritic diseases for which patients have limited or no treatment options. We believe factor D inhibition represents a highly innovative and differentiated mechanism of action with the potential to address C3G. About Rare Disease Day Rare Disease Day is an annual event that takes place on the last day of February. Its goal is to help policy makers and the public understand the impact of rare diseases, such as C3G, on the lives of patients. To learn more, please visit http://www.rarediseaseday.org. About C3G C3G is a devastating disease affecting the kidneys for which there is no approved therapy. C3G affects men and women equally. There are estimated to be approximately 4,000 C3G patients in the United States, more than 4,000 in Europe, and more than 1,000 patients with this disease in Japan. C3G describes a rare renal disease characterized by the presence of predominantly C3 protein fragments in the filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidney. These C3 fragment deposits are thought by experts to be the result of overactivation of the complement alternative pathway. The chronic deposition of C3 fragments results in inflammation in the glomeruli (glomerulonephritis) and subsequent permanent renal damage. An estimated 30-50% of C3G patients will require dialysis or a transplant within 10 years of diagnosis.

Factor D is an essential serine protease involved in the AP, a part of the innate immune system. Achillion's complement platform is focused on seeking to advance small molecule compounds that inhibit factor D and can potentially be used in the treatment of immune-related diseases in which the AP plays a critical role. Potential indications currently being evaluated for these compounds include C3G, immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN), and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH).

Do not miss out and become a member today for free to access this upcoming report at: www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=ACHN Active-Investors.com is focused on giving you timely information and the inside line on companies that matter to you. This morning, Bellicum Pharma most recent news is on our radar and our team decided to put out a fantastic report on the company that is now available for free below: www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=BLCM Bellicum shared that it has received a notification from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) which outlines the criteria required for lifting the clinical hold imposed on US studies of BPX-501. About BPX-501 Bellicum's lead product candidate, BPX-501, has been specifically designed to improve outcomes for patients undergoing haplo-identical (i.e. partial match) hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT). BPX-501 is an adjunct T cell therapy administered after HSCT. It comprises genetically modified donor T cells, based on Bellicum's CaspaCIDe® safety switch. The use of BPX-501 provides the patient with the benefit of having T cells to fight infection, support engraftment, and prevent disease relapse. In case graft versus host disease (GvHD) occurs, the CaspaCIDe® safety switch can be activated to kill the toxic T cells. Thus, BPX-501 can improve outcomes and extend patient eligibility for a haplo-transplant. It also allows physicians to perform stem cell transplants more safely. Clinical Hold on BPX-501 Studies Due to Encephalopathy Cases Bellicum received a notice from the FDA to put a clinical hold on the US studies of BPX-501 on January 30, 2018. The agency suspended all studies after three cases of encephalopathy related to BPX-501 were reported. However, it should be noted that the clinical hold does not affect the Company's BP-004 registration trial in Europe. Bellicum's Plan of Action Since the clinical hold was imposed last month, the Company had been waiting for a formal communication from the FDA to determine the requirements for resuming studies. Now that the FDA has outlined the criteria, Bellicum will work closely with the agency to address their requirements. Bellicum intends to implement revisions to the US study protocols, such as the addition of more comprehensive monitoring and management of neurotoxicity. Moreover, the Company plans to revise the Investigator Brochure and Informed Consent Documents to notify healthcare providers, patients, and caregivers of the changes. The Company intends to provide a full response to the FDA with respect to these issues within a few weeks. Improved Investor Sentiment Bellicum's investors are waiting for the clinical hold to be lifted. The FDA's guidelines allow the Company to prepare a plan of action for obtaining the regulatory approval for BP-004. Thus, the announcement about the FDA's notification went well with the investors. On the day of the announcement, shares were up 33% since bottoming at $5.02 on January 31, 2018, due to the news of clinical hold. Stock Performance Snapshot February 26, 2018 - At Monday's closing bell, Bellicum Pharma's stock rose 3.56%, ending the trading session at $7.28. Volume traded for the day: 672.02 thousand shares. After yesterday's close, Bellicum Pharma's market cap was at $229.68 million. The stock is part of the Healthcare sector, categorized under the Biotechnology industry. This sector was up 1.0% at the end of the session.

ACHN,"NEW HAVEN, Conn., Feb 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACHN, +0.00% a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing small molecule factor D inhibitors to modulate the complement alternative pathway, today announced that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) issued a positive opinion on ACH-4471 for orphan status in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of C3 glomerulopathy (C3G). ""We are very pleased that ACH-4471, a first-in-class, oral inhibitor of complement factor D, has received a positive orphan status opinion for the treatment of C3G. At Achillion, we continually work to enhance the awareness of C3G, a rare renal disorder consisting of dense deposit disease (C3G) and C3 glomerulonephritis (C3GN) for which there are no approved therapies,"" commented Milind Deshpande, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Achillion. Dr. Deshpande further stated, ""The mechanism of action for our factor D inhibitors, highlighted by the safety and efficacy data observed to date with ACH-4471, we believe represents a truly novel and targeted approach to potentially treating C3G, a chronic and devastating disease affecting the kidney. By specifically targeting factor D, we believe we are targeting the root cause of disease, which experts attribute to overactivation of the alternative pathway. By inhibiting factor D, we believe ACH-4471 may be able to reduce the excessive formation of C3 fragments in the blood which in C3G are continually being deposited in the kidney leading to impaired function and potentially renal failure."" There are estimated to be more than 4,000 C3G patients in Europe for whom there are no approved therapies. In the EU, the COMP adopts an opinion on the granting of orphan drug designation, after which the opinion is submitted to the European Commission (EC) for a decision on whether or not to accept the opinion. Orphan drug designation by the EC may provide for regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, and where no satisfactory treatment is available. In addition to a 10-year period of marketing exclusivity in the EU after product approval, orphan drug designation provides incentives for companies seeking protocol assistance from the EMA during the product development phase, and direct access to the centralized authorization procedure. About C3G C3G is a devastating disease affecting the kidney for which there is no approved therapy. C3G affects persons of all ages with men and women equally affected. There are estimated to be approximately 4,000 C3G patients in the United States, more than 4,000 in Europe, and greater than 1,000 patients with this disease in Japan. C3G describes a rare renal disease characterized by the presence of C3 protein fragments in the filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidney. These C3 fragment deposits are thought to be the result of overactivation of the complement alternative pathway. The chronic deposition of C3 fragments results in inflammation in the glomeruli (glomerulonephritis) and subsequent permanent renal damage. An estimated 30-50% of C3G patients will require dialysis or a transplant within 10 years of diagnosis. About the Complement Factor D Platform Achillion has leveraged its internal discovery capabilities and a novel complement-related drug development platform to develop small molecule factor D inhibitor compounds that target the complement AP. Factor D is an essential serine protease involved in the AP, a part of the innate immune system. Achillion's complement portfolio is focused on seeking to advance small molecule compounds that inhibit factor D and can potentially be used in the treatment of immune-related diseases in which the AP plays a critical role. Potential indications currently being evaluated for these compounds include C3G, immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN), and paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). About Achillion Pharmaceuticals Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACHN, +0.00% is a science-driven, patient-focused biopharmaceutical company seeking to leverage its believed strengths across the continuum from discovery through commercialization in its goal of meeting the needs of people with complement-mediated diseases. The company has employed a highly-disciplined discovery and development approach that has allowed it to develop potent and specific complement factor D inhibitors for AP-mediated diseases. Achillion is rapidly advancing its efforts to bring potentially life-saving medicines to patients with rare diseases. More information is available at http://www.achillion.com.

Financial Results Achillion also reported earnings for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017. Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported a net loss of $23.2 million, compared to a net loss of $4.4 million in the three months ended December 31, 2016. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company did not recognize any revenue compared to the three months ended December 31, 2016 in which it recognized $15.0 million of revenue under the Janssen Agreement that was terminated effective November 8, 2017. Research and development expenses were $15.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $15.0 million for the same period of 2016. The increase was primarily due to increased clinical trial expenses for ACH-4471 and manufacturing and formulation expenses for ACH-5228. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, general and administrative expenses totaled $8.7 million, compared to $5.3 million in the same period in 2016. The increase was primarily the result of the Company's payment of the underwriting fees in connection with the public resale by the Johnson and Johnson Development Corporation in November 2017 of all the shares of common stock it acquired from the Company in 2015. Year-end 2017 Financial Results For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's net loss was $85.2 million, or $0.62 per share, compared to a net loss of $61.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, or $0.45 per share. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Achillion did not recognize any revenue compared to the year ended December 31, 2016 in which Achillion recognized $15.0 million of revenue under the Janssen Agreement that was terminated effective November 8, 2017. For the year ended December 31, 2017, research and development expenses totaled $65.1 million, compared to $59.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase primarily related to clinical trial costs for ACH-4471 combined with increased preclinical and manufacturing costs for ACH-5228. Discovery research costs related to our next-generation factor D inhibitors also increased, and were partially offset by decreased preclinical and manufacturing costs for ACH-4471. General and administrative expenses were $24.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $20.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to legal and consulting fees, as well as the Company's payment of underwriting fees, in connection with the public resale by the Johnson and Johnson Development Corporation in November 2017 of all the shares of common stock it acquired from the Company in 2015. Cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, and interest receivable at December 31, 2017 were $331.8 million. Restructuring Details and 2018 Financial Guidance In February, the Company implemented a plan of restructuring to focus on the Company's clinical stage and late-stage preclinical portfolio while retaining the biology and chemistry core strengths necessary to support future clinical development and continue research with its complement factor D portfolio. Under the restructuring, the Company expects to reduce annual projected operating expenses by approximately $10 million, or 12%, from 2017 levels and reduced headcount by approximately 20% over 2017 levels. As a result of its restructuring, the Company expects that research and development expenses during 2018 will be approximately $58-60 million, that general and administrative expenses will be approximately $19 - 20 million, and that net cash used in operating activities in 2018 will be approximately $68 - 70 million based on current operating plans, anticipated timelines and the estimated cost of clinical trials and product development programs. Year-end 2018 cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities are anticipated to total approximately $260 million. The net loss per share for fiscal 2018 is anticipated to approximate $0.55 - 0.58 per share.

The replay passcode is 1079527. About C3G C3G is a devastating disease affecting the kidney, believed to be caused by an overactive AP and for which there is no FDA approved therapy. C3G affects persons of all ages, with an incidence estimated to be at 1-2 cases per year per 1,000,000 people in both the U.S and EU. There are estimated to be at least 8,000 people with C3G in the United States and the major European markets, specifically France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom, and there are no approved treatments. C3G describes a rare kidney disease characterized by the presence of C3 protein fragments in the filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidney. C3 fragment deposition is reported to result from over-activation of the complement alternative pathway. The chronic deposition of C3 fragments results in inflammation in the glomeruli (glomerulonephritis) and often subsequent permanent renal damage. It is reported that an estimated 30-50% of C3G patients will require dialysis or a transplant within 10 years of diagnosis. About PNH PNH is thought to be caused by a mutation resulting in the absence of receptors normally present on red blood cells (RBCs) that interact with the AP. The AP of the complement system typically functions normally in these patients but due to the lack of key receptors, known as CD55 and CD59, on the surface of PNH RBCs, the AP treats these cells as foreign and destroys them via hemolysis in the circulatory system (intravascular) and in the liver or spleen (extravascular). Complement factor D is a critical protein within the amplification loop of the AP and it is believed that inhibiting it could control the AP response. Furthermore, this mechanism of action represents a potentially distinct and unique therapeutic approach for controlling intravascular and extravascular hemolysis associated with PNH. About the Complement Factor D Platform Achillion has leveraged its internal discovery capabilities and a novel complement-related drug development platform to develop small molecule factor D inhibitor compounds that target the complement AP.

ACHN,"Dec 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- - Orphan drug designation for the treatment of C3G granted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) - - Initiated bioavailability study evaluating extended-release formulations of ACH-4471 in healthy volunteers- NEW HAVEN, Conn., Dec. 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACHN, +0.00% a pharmaceutical company focused on advancing small molecule inhibitors of factor D in the complement alternative pathway, today announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to ACH-4471 for the treatment of patients with C3 Glomerulopathy (C3G). C3G is a devastating renal disease for which there is no approved therapy. There are estimated to be approximately 4,000 C3G patients in the United States, approximately 4,000 in Europe, and more than 1,000 patients with this devastating disease in Japan. The FDA Orphan Drug Designation program provides incentives for the development of potentially promising drugs to treat, diagnose or prevent orphan diseases and disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. This designation may provide, under specified conditions, for a seven-year marketing exclusivity period, as well as certain incentives, including federal grants, tax credits and a waiver of PDUFA filing fees. On November 14, 2017, Achillion announced interim data from the first two patients in an on-going Phase 2 study in C3G patients demonstrated that the current formulation of ACH-4471 achieved complement alternative pathway inhibition resulting in greater than 50% reduction in proteinuria over the 14-day treatment period and a favorable tolerability profile. Additionally, Achillion announced the initiation of bioavailability study of extended release formulations of ACH-4471 in healthy volunteers. The extended release oral tablet formulations may have the potential to achieve once or twice daily dosing in patients. ""We are pleased that the FDA has granted orphan drug designation to ACH-4471 for treatment of C3G, and we look forward to additional data from the ongoing extended release formulation study. We are keenly aware of the unmet need for patients and we are committed to advancing ACH-4471 for C3G as we believe we have an opportunity to develop a potentially disease-modifying therapy, based on the unique mechanism of action, for ACH-4471,"" commented Milind Deshpande, Ph.D., President and CEO. ACH-4471: Phase 1 Bioavailability Study of Extended-Release Formulations The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the pharmacokinetic profiles of multiple extended-release formulations of ACH-4471 in healthy subjects, after oral administration, with the goal of identifying an extended-release formulation to enable once or twice daily dosing regimens of ACH-4471. Interim results are anticipated during the second quarter of 2018.

ACHN,"NEW HAVEN, Conn., Nov 06, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACHN, +0.00% today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted orphan drug designation to ACH-4471 for the treatment of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). Furthermore, Achillion announced today that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) issued a positive opinion on ACH-4471 for orphan status in the European Union (EU) for the treatment of PNH. ""We are very pleased with the receipt of orphan drug designation from the FDA, and a positive opinion by COMP for orphan status, for ACH-4471, a first-in-class, oral inhibitor of complement factor D,"" commented Milind Deshpande, Ph.D., President and Chief Executive Officer of Achillion. ""We believe that modulation of the complement alternative pathway by targeting factor D, could provide a novel and pharmacologically differentiated approach to treating diseases of the complement system, including PNH and C3G."" The FDA Orphan Drug Designation program provides incentives for the development of potentially promising drugs to treat, diagnose or prevent orphan diseases and disorders that affect fewer than 200,000 people in the U.S. This designation may provide, under specified conditions, for a seven-year marketing exclusivity period, as well as certain incentives, including federal grants, tax credits and a waiver of PDUFA filing fees. The COMP adopts an opinion on the granting of orphan drug designation, after which the opinion is submitted to the European Commission (EC) for a decision on whether or not to accept the opinion. Orphan drug designation by the EC may provide for regulatory and financial incentives for companies to develop and market therapies that treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting no more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU, and where no satisfactory treatment is available. In addition to a 10-year period of marketing exclusivity in the EU after product approval, orphan drug designation provides incentives for companies seeking protocol assistance from the EMA during the product development phase, and direct access to the centralized authorization procedure. About Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria PNH is thought to be caused by a mutation resulting in the absence of receptors normally present on red blood cells (RBCs) that interact with the alternative pathway (AP). The AP of the complement system typically functions normally in these patients but due to the lack of key receptors, known as CD55 and CD59, on the surface of PNH RBCs, the AP treats these cells as foreign and destroys them via hemolysis in the circulatory system (intravascular hemolysis). Factor D is a critical protein of the AP, including the amplification loop of the complement system, and it is believed that inhibiting it could control the AP activity. Furthermore, this mechanism of action represents a potentially distinct and unique therapeutic approach for controlling both intravascular hemolysis, and extravascular hemolysis associated with C5 targeted therapies for PNH. About the Achillion Alternative Pathway Complement Factor D Platform Achillion has leveraged its internal discovery capabilities and a novel complement-related drug development platform to develop small molecule factor D inhibitor compounds that target the complement AP. Factor D is an essential serine protease involved in the AP, a part of the innate immune system. Achillion's complement platform is focused on seeking to advance small molecule compounds that inhibit factor D and can potentially be used in the treatment of immune-related diseases in which the AP plays a critical role. Potential indications currently being evaluated for these compounds include paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), C3 glomerulopathy (C3G), immune complex-mediated membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (IC-MPGN), and geographic atrophy (GA), an advanced form of dry age-related macular degeneration (dry AMD). About Achillion Pharmaceuticals Achillion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ACHN, +0.00% is a science-driven, patient-focused company seeking to leverage its strengths across the continuum from discovery to commercialization in its goal of providing better treatments for people with serious diseases. The company employs a highly-disciplined discovery and development approach that has allowed it to pursue best-in-class oral antiviral therapy for chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and build a platform of potent and specific complement factor D inhibitors for AP-mediated diseases. Achillion is rapidly advancing its efforts to become a fully-integrated pharmaceutical company with a goal of bringing life-saving medicines to patients with rare diseases.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements This press release includes forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 that are subject to risks, uncertainties and other important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. Achillion may use words such as ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""project,"" ""target,"" ""intend,"" ""plan,"" ""aim,"" ""believe,"" ""seek,"" ""estimate,"" ""can,"" ""could"" ""focus,"" ""will,"" ""look forward,"" ""goal,"" ""may,"" ""potential,"" and similar expressions to identify such forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements also include statements about: Achillion's ability to obtain and maintain orphan drug designation for ACH-4771 and the expected benefits of orphan drug designation; the potential benefits of, and potential indications for, Achillion's compounds that inhibit factor D, including ACH-4771; and statements concerning Achillion's strategic goals, efforts, plans, and prospects. Among the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements are risks relating to, among other things, Achillion's ability to: successfully obtain orphan drug designation from the EC for ACH-4771; maintain any orphan drug designation once obtained; avail itself of any of the benefits of orphan drug designation for ACH-4771, assuming that such designation is successfully obtained and maintained, because, for example, even if Achillion obtains orphan drug designation, exclusivity may not prevent the FDA, EMA or other regulatory authorities from approving competing products; advance the preclinical and clinical development of its complement factor D inhibitors under the timelines it projects in current and future preclinical studies and clinical trials; obtain and maintain patent protection for its drug candidates and the freedom to operate under third party intellectual property, including completing the patent process such that patents issue with respect to composition of matter claims for compounds that inhibit complement factor D activity; demonstrate in any current and future clinical trials the requisite safety, efficacy and combinability of its drug candidates; obtain and maintain necessary regulatory approvals, and the granting of orphan designation does not alter the standard regulatory requirements and process for obtaining such approval; establish commercial manufacturing arrangements; identify, enter into and maintain collaboration and other commercial agreements with third-parties; compete successfully in the markets in which it seeks to develop and commercialize its product candidates and future products; manage expenses; manage litigation; raise the substantial additional capital needed to achieve its business objectives; and successfully execute on its business strategies. These and other risks are described in the reports filed by Achillion with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017, and any subsequent SEC filings. In addition, any forward-looking statement in this press release represents Achillion's views only as of the date of this press release and should not be relied upon as representing its views as of any subsequent date. Achillion disclaims any duty to update any forward-looking statement, except as required by applicable law.
