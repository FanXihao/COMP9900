OFED,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of such words as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, plan, seek, expect and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include: ? statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; ? statements regarding our business plans and prospects and growth and operating strategies; ? statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and ? estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: ? our ability to manage our operations nationally and in our market areas; ? adverse changes in the financial industry, securities, credit and national and local real estate markets (including real estate values); ? significant increases in our delinquencies and loan losses, including as a result of our inability to resolve classified assets, changes in the underlying cash flows of our borrowers, and management's assumptions in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; ? credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies and write-offs and in our allowance and provision for loan losses; ? use of estimates for determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuations; ? increased competition among depository and other financial institutions; ? our ability to attract and maintain deposits, including introducing new deposit products; ? inflation and changes in interest rates generally, including changes in the relative differences between short term and long term interest rates and in deposit interest rates, that may affect our net interest margin and funding sources; ? fluctuations in the demand for loans, which may be affected by the number of unsold homes, land and other properties in our market areas and by declines in the value of real estate in our market area; ? declines in the yield on our assets resulting from the current low interest rate environment; ? our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, including attracting and maintaining deposits and introducing new financial products; ? risks related to high concentration of loans secured by real estate located in our market areas; ? changes in the level of government support of housing finance; ? the results of examinations by our regulators, including the possibility that our regulators may, among other things, require us to increase our reserve for loan losses, write down assets, change our regulatory capital position, limit our ability to borrow funds or maintain or increase deposits, or prohibit us from paying dividends, which could adversely affect our dividends and earnings; ? our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; ? changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, which could result in, among other things, increased deposit insurance premiums and assessments, capital requirements (particularly the new capital regulations), regulatory fees and compliance costs and the resources we have available to address such changes; ? changes in the ability of third-party providers to perform their obligations to us; ? technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; ? our reliance on a small executive staff; ? changes in our compensation and benefit plans, and our ability to retain key members of our senior management team and to address staffing needs to implement our strategic plan; ? changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; ? changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; ? our ability to control costs and expenses, particularly those related to operating as a publicly traded company; ? the ability of the U.S. government to manage federal debt limits; ? other changes in our financial condition or results of operations that reduce capital available to pay dividends; ? other changes in the financial condition or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own, including our stock in the FHLB of Atlanta; and ? other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and operational factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services. Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Critical Accounting Policies There are no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for Oconee Federal Financial Corp. for the year ended June 30, 2017, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017 Our total assets decreased by $436 thousand, or 0.09%, to $480.9 million at December 31, 2017 from $481.3 million at June 30, 2017. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $14.0 million, or 67.3%, to $6.8 million at December 31, 2017 from $20.7 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to an anticipated withdrawal from a single customer's deposit account that had been invested by the Association in a money market account. Our available-for-sale securities portfolio increased by $3.8 million from $118.3 million at June 30, 2017 to $122.2 million at December 31, 2017. Gross loans increased $9.5 million, or 3.1%, to $317.1 million at December 31, 2017 from $307.6 million at June 30, 2017. This increase is a result of increased construction and land loan demand experienced during the six months ended December 31, 2017. Proceeds from FHLB advances were used to the loan and investment growth. Deposits decreased $23.2 million, or 5.9%, to $371.3 million at December 31, 2017 from $394.5 million at June 30, 2017. The decrease in our deposits reflected a decrease of $21.5 million in money market deposits, $3.4 million in certificates of deposit, and $688 thousand in savings deposits, offset by an increase of $910 thousand in NOW accounts and an increase of $1.5 million in non-interest bearing checking. The decrease in money market deposits was due to an anticipated withdrawal from a single customer. The decrease in certificates of deposit is attributed to local competitive rates. Oconee Federal, MHC's cash is held on deposit with the Company. We generally do not accept brokered deposits and no brokered deposits were accepted during the six months ended December 31, 2017. We had no advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta as of June 30, 2017 but did have $20.0 million as of December 31, 2017. We have credit available under a loan agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta in the amount of 25% of our total assets as of December 31, 2017, or approximately $118.9 million. We had no federal funds purchased as of June 30, 2017 but did have $2.8 million as of December 31, 2017. Total shareholders' equity decreased $654 thousand, or 0.8%, to $85.3 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $86.0 million at June 30, 2017. This was primarily due to our net income during the period of $798 thousand being offset by an increase in unrealized losses in our investment portfolio and our payment of dividends of $1.1 million. The Company and the Bank exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. Nonperforming Assets The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated. December 31, June 30, 2017 2017 (Dollars in thousands) Nonaccrual loans: Real estate loans: One-to-four family $ 3,558 $ 2,762 Multi-family - - Home equity 40 89 Nonresidential 975 43 Agricultural 480 514 Construction and land 301 75 Total real estate loans 5,354 3,483 Commercial and industrial - - Consumer and other loans - - Total nonaccrual loans (1) $ 5,354 $ 3,483 Accruing loans past due 90 days or more: Real estate loans: Total accruing loans past due 90 days or more $ - $ - Total of nonaccrual and 90 days or more past due loans (2) $ 5,354 $ 3,483 Real estate owned, net: One-to-four family $ 137 $ 152 Nonresidential 713 713 Construction and land - - Other nonperforming assets - - Total nonperforming assets $ 6,204 $ 4,348 Accruing troubled debt restructurings - - Troubled debt restructurings and total nonperforming assets $ 6,204 $ 4,348 Total nonperforming loans to total loans 1.69 % 1.13 % Total nonperforming assets to total assets 1.29 % 0.90 % Total nonperforming assets to loans and real estate owned 1.95 % 1.41 %  (1) Nonaccrual troubled debt restructurings included in the totals above were $3.0 million and $1.6 million, at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017, respectively. (2) There were no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. Interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $148 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2017. Interest of $33 thousand was recognized on these loans and is included in net income for the six months ended December 31, 2017. Interest income that would have been recorded had our troubled debt restructured loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $76 thousand for the six months ended December 31, 2017. Interest recognized on troubled debt restructured for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $17 thousand. Nonperforming assets increased $1.9 million from $4.3 million as of June 30, 2017 to $6.2 million as of December 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loans increased $1.9 million to $5.4 million as of December 31, 2017 and real estate owned decreased $15 thousand to $850 thousand as of December 31, 2017. There were no accruing loans past due 90 days or more at either date. The increase in nonaccrual loans is primarily related to several large loans in both the one-to-four family and non-residential categories. These did not result in specific reserve allocations or charge-offs during the period. Nonperforming assets to total assets and nonperforming assets to loans and real estate owned were 1.29% and 1.95%, respectively, at December 31, 2017 compared to 0.90% and 1.41%, respectively at June 30, 2017. Analysis of Net Interest Margin The following table sets forth average balance sheets, average annualized yields and rates, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to income.

We reported a net loss of $59 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net income of $1.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The primary reason for the decrease is due to a $973 thousand adjustment to the Company's deferred tax assets required due to the federal tax reform legislation of 2017. Interest income decreased $3 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 while interest expense increased $91 thousand resulting in a net decrease to net interest income of $94 thousand. Noninterest income decreased $172 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to December 31, 2016 due primarily to reduced gains recognized upon the payoff of PCI loans and securities. Total noninterest expense increased $559 thousand primarily due to increased cost in salaries, occupancy, data processing and the change in the value of the loan servicing asset. Interest Income. Interest income remained stable at $4.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The yield on interest-earning assets increased one basis point from 3.85% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 to 3.86% for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Total average interest-earning assets declined by $2.2 million to $439.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $441.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Interest income on loans remained stable at $3.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. The yield on loans decreased 29 basis points from 4.88% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 to 4.59% for the three months ended December 31, 2017, a result of the repayments of older, higher yielding loans being replaced by loans with lower yields. The average balance of loans increased by $17.0 million, or 5.7%, to $315.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $298.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the average balance of our loans is reflective of normal loan growth. Interest income on investment securities increased by $44 thousand, or 7.7%, to $612 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $568 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase reflected the combination of a decrease in the average balance of securities of $4.2 million, or 3.3%, to $121.9 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $126.1 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016 and an increase in the yield on securities to 2.01% from 1.80% for the respective periods. The decrease in the average balances of our investment securities is reflective of our efforts during early fiscal 2017 to fund loan growth using investment repayments. This reduced our average investments balances as reflected in the current period. Beginning late fiscal 2017, the Company began to maintain and grow investments and now borrows wholesale funds if needed for loan and investment growth when deemed prudent by management. The average balance of interest-earning deposits decreased $15.0 million from the three months ended December 31, 2016 to the three months ended December 31, 2017 while the yield increased 65 basis points over the same period. The decrease in funds was primarily due to an anticipated withdrawal from a single customer's deposit account that had been invested by the Association in a money market account. The increase in yield was primarily a result of increased short term rates on deposits due to market rate increases. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $91 thousand, or 28.2%, to $414 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $323 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase reflected an increase of seven basis points in the average rate paid on deposits for the three months ended December 31, 2017 to 0.42% from 0.35% for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase in the average rate paid on deposits is reflective of our efforts to keep our cost of funds as low as possible but still maintain our competitiveness in our market area among other banking institutions. Average interest-bearing deposits were $346.6 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $369.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The largest increase in interest expense was related to expense on certificates of deposit, which increased $55 thousand, or 24.0%, to $284 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $229 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased from 0.42% for the three months ended December 31, 2016 to 0.56% for the three months ended December 31, 2017 while average balances decreased from $213.9 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2016 to $201.5 million for the three-month period ended December 31, 2017. Interest expense for other borrowings increased by $51 thousand. There were no FHLB borrowings in the three months ended December 31, 2016, while the three months ended December 31, 2017 had an average of $15.5 million with a weighted average rate of 1.31%. Net Interest Income. Net interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased by $94 thousand, or 2.4%, to $3.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Our interest rate spread and net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased to 3.41% and 3.49%, respectively, from 3.50% and 3.55%, respectively, for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The stable yield on earning assets along with the higher cost of certificates of deposit and other borrowings primarily contributed to the decrease in net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2017. Provision for Loan Losses. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $9 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared with $24 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. There was $1 thousand of net charge-offs for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to none for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The lower provision is primarily due to a favorable shift in our ratio of originated loans to acquired loans. Our total allowance for loan losses was $1.0 million, or 0.33%, of total gross loans, at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. The allowance for specifically identified impaired loans was zero at December 31, 2017 compared to $8 thousand at June 30, 2017. The recorded investment in impaired loans at December 31, 2017 was $4.3 million compared to $3.7 million at June 30, 2017. The general valuation allowance was $1.0 million at December 31, 2017 and June 30, 2017. Total loans evaluated collectively for impairment increased $11 million, or 3.6%, to $314.8 million at December 31, 2017 compared to $303.8 million at June 30, 2017. To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. There have been no changes to our allowance for loan loss methodology. Noninterest Income. Noninterest income decreased $172 thousand, or 34.7%, to $323 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2017 from $495 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. No gains on the disposition of PCI loans were recognized for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $120 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net gains on sales of investment securities available for sale were zero for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $57 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Gains on sales of securities are largely market driven. Noninterest Expense. Noninterest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased by $559 thousand, or 22.8%, to $3.0 million from $2.5 million for the same period in 2016. Salaries and employee benefits increased $105 thousand due to routine increases. Occupancy and data processing increased $159 thousand due to routine upgrades and improvements. The change in the value of the loan servicing portfolio decreased $261 thousand due to market conditions. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.2 million compared with $618 thousand for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an adjustment to the . . . Feb 13, 2018 (c) 1995-2018 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

OFED,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Oconee Federal Savings and Loan Association has historically operated as a traditional thrift institution headquartered in Seneca, South Carolina. Our principal business consists of attracting retail deposits from the general public in our market area and investing those deposits, together with funds generated from operations, in one-to-four family residential mortgage loans and, to a much lesser extent, nonresidential mortgage, construction and land and other loans. We also invest in U.S. Government and federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities. Our revenues are derived principally from the interest on loans and securities and loan fees and service charges. Our primary sources of funds are deposits and principal and interest payments on loans and securities. At June 30, 2017, we had total assets of $481.3 million, total deposits of $394.5 million and total equity of $86.0 million. TABLE OF CONTENTS A significant majority of our assets consist of long-term, fixed-rate residential mortgage loans and, to a much lesser extent, investment-quality securities, which we have funded primarily with deposit accounts and the repayment of existing loans. We generally do not rely on outside borrowings. Our results of operations depend primarily on our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, consisting primarily of loans, investment securities (including U.S. Government and federal agency securities, mortgage-backed securities and municipal securities) and other interest-earning assets, primarily interest-earning deposits at other financial institutions, and the interest paid on our interest-bearing liabilities, consisting primarily of savings and transaction accounts and certificates of deposit. Our results of operations also are affected by our provisions for loan losses, noninterest income and noninterest expense. Noninterest income currently consists primarily of service charges on deposit accounts and miscellaneous other income. Noninterest expense currently consists primarily of compensation and employee benefits, occupancy and equipment expenses, data processing, professional and supervisory fees, office expense, provision for real estate owned and related expenses, and other operating expenses. Our results of operations also may be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions, changes in market interest rates, governmental policies and actions of regulatory authorities. Other than our loans for the construction of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, we do not offer ""interest only"" mortgage loans on one-to-four family residential properties (where the borrower pays interest for an initial period, after which the loan converts to a fully amortizing loan). We also do not offer loans that provide for negative amortization of principal, such as ""Option ARM"" loans, where the borrower can pay less than the interest owed on his or her loan, resulting in an increased principal balance during the life of the loan. We do not offer ""subprime loans"" (loans that generally target borrowers with weakened credit histories typically characterized by payment delinquencies, previous charge-offs, judgments, bankruptcies, or borrowers with questionable repayment capacity as evidenced by low credit scores or high debt-burden ratios) or Alt-A loans. Critical Accounting Policies We consider accounting policies that require management to exercise significant judgment or discretion or make significant assumptions that have, or could have, a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets or on income, to be critical accounting policies. Additional discussions of these policies are discussed in Note 1 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8. We consider the following to be our critical accounting policies: Allowance for Loan Losses. Our allowance for loan losses is the estimated amount considered necessary to reflect probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date. The allowance is established through the provision for loan losses, which is charged against income. In determining the allowance for loan losses, management makes significant estimates and judgments, which to some extent involve assumptions about borrowers' abilities to continue to make future principal and interest payments. These estimates and judgments involve a high degree of judgment and subjectivity and are based on facts and circumstances that existed at the date in which the allowance is determined. Changes in the macro and micro economic environment can have a significant impact on these estimates and judgments in the future that could result in changes to the allowance for loan losses. Integral to our allowance methodology is the use of a loan grading system whereby all loans are assigned a grade based on the risk profile of each loan. Loan grades are initially assigned at origination and are routinely evaluated to determine if grades need to be changed. Through our internal credit review function, ongoing credit monitoring, and continuous review of past due trends, loan grades are adjusted by management either to respond to improvements in or deterioration of credit. Loan grades are determined based on an evaluation of relevant information about the ability of borrowers to service their debt such as current financial information, historical payment experience, credit documentation, public information, and current economic trends, among other factors. The allowance methodology consists of two parts: an evaluation of loss for specific loans and an evaluation of loss for homogenous pools of loans, commonly referred to as the specific and general valuation allowance. Certain loans exhibiting signs of potential credit weakness are evaluated individually for impairment. A loan is considered to be impaired if it is probable that we will not receive substantially all TABLE OF CONTENTS contractual principal and interest payments. The amount of impairment, or specific valuation allowance, is measured by a comparison of the present value of expected future cash flows less selling expenses to the loan's carrying value, or in the case of collateral dependent loans a comparison to the fair value of the collateral less selling costs. To the extent the carrying value of the loan exceeds the present value of a loan's expected cash flows less selling expenses, a specific allowance is recorded. If the carrying value is less than the present value of the impaired loan's expected future cash flows, no specific allowance is recorded however the loan is not included in the determination of the general valuation allowance. As a substantial amount of our loan portfolio is collateralized by real estate, appraisals of the underlying value of property securing loans and discounted cash flow valuations of properties are critical in determining the amount of the allowance required for specific loans. Assumptions for appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are instrumental in determining the value of properties. Overly optimistic assumptions or negative changes to assumptions could significantly impact the valuation of a property securing a loan and the related allowance determined. The assumptions supporting such appraisals and discounted cash flow valuations are carefully reviewed by management to determine that the resulting values reasonably reflect amounts realizable on the related loans. The general valuation allowance is determined for loans not determined to be impaired. We segregate our loan portfolio into portfolio segments. These portfolio segments share common characteristics such as the type of loan, its purpose, its underlying collateral, and other risk characteristics. Once segregated, these loans are further segregated by loan grade. To calculate the allowance by grade, we apply internally developed loss factors comprised of both quantitative and qualitative considerations. We estimate our loss factors by taking into consideration both quantitative and qualitative aspects that would affect our estimation of probable incurred losses. These aspects include, but are not limited to historical charge-offs; loan delinquencies and foreclosure trends; current economic trends and demographic data within our market area, such as unemployment rates and population trends; current trends in real estate values; charge-off trends of other comparable institutions; the results of any internal loan reviews; loan-to-value ratios; our historically conservative credit risk policy; the strength of our underwriting and ongoing credit monitoring function; and other relevant factors. This evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates that may be susceptible to significant revision based on changes in economic and real estate market conditions. Actual loan losses may be significantly more than the allowance for loan losses we have established, which could have a material negative effect on our financial results. See Note 1 ""Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" and Note 4 ""Loans"" to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for additional discussion on the allowance for loan losses. Business Combinations. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting. As such, assets acquired, including identified intangible assets, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair value, which often involves estimates based on third party valuations, such as appraisals, or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques, all of which are inherently subjective. Identified intangible assets are amortized based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received, which is also subjective. Management will review identified intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, in which case an impairment charge would be recorded. Goodwill is subject to impairment testing on at least an annual basis. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Our reporting unit for purposes of testing our goodwill for impairment is our banking operations unit, which contains all other activities performed by the Company. Valuation of Goodwill. The testing for impairment of goodwill is a two-step process. The first step in testing for impairment is to determine the fair value of our reporting unit and compare that fair value with the carrying value of the reporting unit (including goodwill.) If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, the second step is not necessary and goodwill is deemed not to be impaired. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the Company must estimate a hypothetical purchase price for the reporting unit (representing the unit's fair value) and then compare that hypothetical purchase price with the fair value of the unit's net assets (excluding goodwill). Any excess of the estimated TABLE OF CONTENTS purchase price over the fair value of the reporting unit's net assets represents the implied fair value of goodwill. An impairment loss would be recognized as a charge to earnings if the carrying amount of the reporting unit's goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill. Our annual impairment evaluation is May of each year. Deferred Income Taxes. We use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. If current available information raises doubt as to the realization of the deferred tax assets, a valuation allowance is established. These judgments and estimates are reviewed on a continual basis as regulatory and business factors change. Real Estate Owned Valuation. Real estate acquired through loan foreclosure is carried at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less estimated costs to sell. Any initial losses at the time of foreclosure are charged against the allowance for loan losses. Valuation of these assets are periodically reviewed by management with the carrying value of such assets adjusted through noninterest expense to the then estimated fair value, net of estimated selling costs, if lower, until disposition. Fair values of real estate owned are generally based on third party appraisals or other valuations of the property. Business Strategy We have continued our primarily focus on the execution of our community oriented retail banking strategy. Highlights of our current business strategy include the following: Continue to Focus on Residential Lending. We have been and will continue to be primarily a one-to-four family residential mortgage lender for borrowers in our market area. As of June 30, 2017, $260.1 million, or 84.6%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of one-to-four family residential mortgage loans (including home equity loans). In the future, we may gradually increase our residential construction and home equity loan portfolios. TABLE OF CONTENTS area only. Our nonperforming assets totaled $4.3 million, or 0.9% of total assets at June 30, 2017. Our total nonperforming loans to total loans ratio was 1.1% at June 30, 2017. Total loan delinquencies, 30 days or more past due, as of June 30, 2017, were $9.1 million, or 3.0% of total loans. A prior year acquisition of Stephens Federal resulted in increases to nonperforming assets and delinquencies compared to periods prior to the acquisition; however, these have subsequently declined. TABLE OF CONTENTS Interest income on investment securities increased $78 thousand, or 3.5%, to $2.33 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $2.25 million for the year ended June 30, 2016, reflecting an increase of $2.4 million, or 2.0%, in the average balances of securities to $123.9 million from $121.5 million for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 and an increase in the total average yield of our investment securities of three basis points to 1.88% from 1.85%. The increase in average balances of our investment securities is reflective of our efforts to continue to invest in high-quality investment securities to efficiently leverage our capital. Additionally, we continue to shift more of our investment portfolio into high-quality, higher yielding municipal securities, which helps to reduce our overall tax liability. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $135 thousand, or 11.4%, to $1.3 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $1.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. The average rate paid on interest bearing deposits increased four basis points in fiscal year 2017 to 0.36% from 0.32% for fiscal year 2016. The increase in the average rate paid on deposits was offset by the decrease in the average balance of deposits of $2.4 million, or 0.7%, to $370.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $373.2 million for the year ended June 30, 2016. Interest expense on money market deposits increased $99 thousand as the cost of these deposits decreased five basis points from 0.41% for the year ended June 30, 2016 to 0.36% for the year ended June 30, 2017. The average balance of money market deposits increased from $47.6 million to $81.8 million for the same period. The increases resulted from continued success of a money market campaign started during the year ended June 30, 2016. Interest expense on NOW and demand deposits and regular savings and other deposits increased by $33 thousand to $101 thousand for the year ended June 30, 2017 from $68 thousand for the year ended June 30, 2016. The increase in interest expense on these deposits was largely attributable to the increase in the average cost on these deposits to 0.13% from 0.08%, offset by a 12.2 million decrease in deposits. Net Interest Income. Net interest income decreased by $736 thousand, or 4.4%, to $15.8 million for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared to $16.6 million for fiscal 2016. Net interest margin for the year ended June 30, 2017 was 3.58%, down 19 basis points from 3.77% for the year ended June 30, 2016. This decrease in net interest margin was reflective of the decrease in our average yield on interest earning assets to 3.88% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 4.04% for the year ended June 30, 2016 and the increase in the average cost of funds to 0.36% for the year ended June 30, 2017 from 0.32% for the year ended June 30, 2016. Provision for Loan Losses. We recorded a provision for loan losses of $203 thousand for the year ended June 30, 2017 compared with a provision of $451 thousand for the year ended June 30, 2016. Net charge-offs for the year ended June 30, 2017 were $109 thousand. Net charge-offs for the year ended June 30, 2016 were $537 thousand. The general valuation allowance increased and the specific valuation decreased from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017. However the allowance as a percentage of total loans remained stable and only increased by one basis point, from 0.32% on June 30, 2016, to 0.33% on June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2017, impaired loans totaled $3.7 million compared to $5.4 million at June 30, 2016. Our ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans decreased to 1.1% at June 30, 2017 from 1.3% at June 30, 2016, and our ratio of nonperforming assets to total assets decreased to 0.9% from 1.1% at the same dates. Total nonperforming loans were $3.5 million at June 30, 2017 compared to $3.8 million at June 30, 2016. We used the same overall methodology in assessing the allowances for both periods ended. Adjustments were made to methodology to extend the historical loss lookback period. Our allowance at June 30, 2017 reflects both a general valuation component of $1.1 million and a specific component of $8 thousand for loans determined to be impaired based upon an analysis of certain individual loans determined to be impaired. In comparison, our allowance at June 30, 2016 consisted of a general valuation component of $738 thousand and a specific component of $184 thousand. Overall, our allowance for loan losses to the total gross carrying value of loans remained stable at 0.33% for June 30, 2017 and 0.32% for June 30, 2016. To the best of our knowledge, we have recorded all losses that are both probable and reasonably estimable for the years ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Noninterest Income. For the year ended June 30, 2017, noninterest income decreased $517 thousand, or 19.6%, to $2.1 million from $2.6 million for the year ended June 30, 2016.

OFED,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Quarterly Report contains forward-looking statements, which can be identified by the use of such words as estimate, project, believe, intend, anticipate, plan, seek, expect and similar expressions. These forward-looking statements include: � statements of our goals, intentions and expectations; � statements regarding our business plans and prospects and growth and operating strategies; � statements regarding the asset quality of our loan and investment portfolios; and � estimates of our risks and future costs and benefits. These forward-looking statements are based on our current beliefs and expectations and are inherently subject to significant business, economic, and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond our control. In addition, these forward-looking statements are subject to assumptions with respect to future business strategies and decisions that are subject to change. We are under no duty to and do not take any obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this Quarterly Report. The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ materially from the anticipated results or other expectations expressed in the forward-looking statements: � our ability to manage our operations under the current adverse economic conditions (including real estate values, loan demand, inflation, commodity prices and employment levels) nationally and in our market areas; � adverse changes in the financial industry, securities, credit and national and local real estate markets (including real estate values); � significant increases in our delinquencies and loan losses, including as a result of our inability to resolve classified assets, changes in the underlying cash flows of our borrowers, and management's assumptions in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses; � credit risks of lending activities, including changes in the level and trend of loan delinquencies and write-offs and in our allowance and provision for loan losses; � use of estimates for determining the fair value of certain of our assets, which may prove to be incorrect and result in significant declines in valuations; � increased competition among depository and other financial institutions; � our ability to attract and maintain deposits, including introducing new deposit products; � changes in interest rates generally, including changes in the relative differences between short term and long term interest rates and in deposit interest rates, that may affect our net interest margin and funding sources; � fluctuations in the demand for loans, which may be affected by the number of unsold homes, land and other properties in our market areas and by declines in the value of real estate in our market area; � declines in the yield on our assets resulting from the current low interest rate environment; � our ability to successfully implement our business strategies, including attracting and maintaining deposits and introducing new financial products; � risks related to high concentration of loans secured by real estate located in our market areas; � changes in the level of government support of housing finance; Table of Contents � the results of examinations by our regulators, including the possibility that our regulators may, among other things, require us to increase our reserve for loan losses, write down assets, change our regulatory capital position, limit our ability to borrow funds or maintain or increase deposits, or prohibit us from paying dividends, which could adversely affect our dividends and earnings; � our ability to enter new markets successfully and capitalize on growth opportunities; � changes in laws or government regulations or policies affecting financial institutions, which could result in, among other things, increased deposit insurance premiums and assessments, capital requirements (particularly the new capital regulations), regulatory fees and compliance costs and the resources we have available to address such changes; � technological changes that may be more difficult or expensive than expected; � our reliance on a small executive staff; � changes in our compensation and benefit plans, and our ability to retain key members of our senior management team and to address staffing needs to implement our strategic plan; � changes in consumer spending, borrowing and savings habits; � changes in accounting policies and practices, as may be adopted by the bank regulatory agencies, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board; � our ability to control costs and expenses, particularly those related to operating as a publicly traded company; � other changes in our financial condition or results of operations that reduce capital available to pay dividends; � other changes in the financial condition or future prospects of issuers of securities that we own, including our stock in the FHLB of Atlanta; and � other economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and operational factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services. Because of these and a wide variety of other uncertainties, our actual future results may be materially different from the results indicated by these forward-looking statements. Critical Accounting Policies There are no material changes to the critical accounting policies disclosed in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for Oconee Federal Financial Corp. for the year ended June 30, 2016, as filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Comparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016 Our total assets decreased by $5 million, or 1.0%, to $480.6 million at March 31, 2017 from $485.6 million at June 30, 2016. Total cash and cash equivalents decreased $2.7 million, or 9.5%, to $25 million at March 31, 2017 from $27.7 million at June 30, 2016. Our available-for-sale securities portfolio also decreased from $132.1 million at June 30, 2016 to $115.6 million at March 31, 2017. Proceeds from sales, calls and principal repayments of securities and excess cash was used to fund loan growth. Gross loans increased $13.9 million, or 4.8%, to $306 million at March 31, 2017 from $292.1 million at June 30, 2016. This increase is a result of increased loan demand experienced during the nine months ended March 31, 2017. Deposits decreased $4.7 million, or 1.2%, to $394.9 million at March 31, 2017 from $399.6 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in our deposits reflected a decrease of $17.7 million in certificates of deposit, offset by increases of $776 thousand in savings deposits, $10.4 million in money market deposits, $232 thousand in NOW accounts, and an increase of $1.6 million in noninterest bearing accounts. The increase in money market deposits reflects an increase in rate on certain money market accounts during the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and increased efforts to offer and market our deposit products. We believe the decline in our certificates of deposit reflects depositors moving their deposits into higher yielding investments in the market. Table of Contents Oconee Federal, MHC's cash is held on deposit with the Company. We generally do not accept brokered deposits and no brokered deposits were accepted during the nine months ended March 31, 2017. We had no advances from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta as of March 31, 2017 or June 30, 2016. We have credit available under a loan agreement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta in the amount of 25% of our total assets as of March 31, 2017, or approximately $120.2 million. Total shareholders' equity decreased $645 thousand, or 0.8%, to $84.8 million at March 31, 2017 compared to $85.4 million at June 30, 2016. Our net income for nine months of $4 million was offset by our other comprehensive loss of $2.4 million for the nine months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in other comprehensive loss was a result of the rising interest rate environment relative to the interest rate environment in which the investment securities were purchased. Management did not believe the unrealized losses represented an other-than-temporary impairment. Dividends of $1.6 million and share repurchases of $1.2 million also contributed to the decrease in shareholders' equity during the period. The Company and the Bank exceeded all minimum regulatory capital requirements for the period. Nonperforming Assets The table below sets forth the amounts and categories of our nonperforming assets at the dates indicated.

(2) There were no loans past due 90 days or more and still accruing at March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016. Table of Contents Interest income that would have been recorded had our non-accruing loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $159 thousand and $84 thousand for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest of $118 thousand and $15 thousand, respectively, was recognized on these loans and is included in net income for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest income that would have been recorded had our troubled debt restructured loans been current in accordance with their original terms was $98 thousand and $55 thousand, respectively, for the nine months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Nonperforming assets decreased $803 thousand from June 30, 2016 to March 31, 2017. Nonaccrual loans decreased $260 thousand and real estate owned decreased $543 thousand. There were no accruing loans past due 90 days or more at either date. The decrease in nonaccrual loans primarily related to seasonal fluctuations. Nonperforming assets to total assets and nonperforming assets to loans and real estate owned were 0.90% and 1.40%, respectively, at March 31, 2017 compared to 1.05% and 1.74%, respectively at June 30, 2016. Table of Contents Analysis of Net Interest Margin The following tables set forth average balance sheets, average annualized yields and rates, and certain other information for the periods indicated. No tax-equivalent yield adjustments were made, as the effect thereof was not material. All average balances are daily average balances. Nonaccrual loans were included in the computation of average balances, but have been reflected in the tables as loans carrying a zero yield. The yields set forth below include the effect of net deferred costs, discounts and premiums that are amortized or accreted to income.

We reported net income of $1.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as well as for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Interest income decreased $358 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 while interest expense increased $38 thousand resulting in a net decrease to net interest income of $396 thousand. Noninterest income increased $338 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to March 31, 2016 due primarily to gains recognized upon the payoff of several PCI loans. Total noninterest expense decreased $315 thousand primarily due to lower professional fee expenses and the net change in the loan servicing asset. Interest Income. Interest income decreased by $358 thousand, or 7.8%, to $4.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $4.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The yield on interest-earning assets decreased 35 basis points from 4.21% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 3.86% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The decrease was slightly offset by an increase in total average interest-earning assets of $2.4 million to $441.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $439 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Interest income on loans was $3.6 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The yield on loans decreased 63 basis points from 5.42% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 4.79% for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The average balance of loans increased by $9.8 million, or 3.3%, to $303.7 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $293.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in the average balance of our loans is reflective of normalized loan growth in our South Carolina market coupled with flat loan growth in our Georgia market. As a result of the acquisition of Stephens Federal Bank in December 2014, we did obtain loans in our Georgia market with slightly higher coupon rates from ours, which had a positive effect of increasing our overall loan portfolio yield in the prior year period, but those balances have now subsequently been reduced and or refinanced at lower current market rates. Interest income on investment securities decreased by $25 thousand, or 4.2%, to $568 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $593 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease reflected a decrease in the average balance of securities of $3.4 million, or 2.7%, to $120.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $123.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 and a decrease of three basis points in the yield on securities to 1.89% from 1.92%. The decrease in the average balances of our investment securities is reflective of our efforts to help fund lending through investment repayments as opposed to wholesale borrowing. The average balance of interest-earning deposits decreased $4 million from the three months ended March 31, 2016 to the three months ended March 31, 2017 while the yield increased 58 basis points over the same period. The increase in yield was primarily a result of variable rate Money Market accounts that have increased in rate due to market conditions. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $38 thousand, or 13.1%, to $329 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $291 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase reflected an increase of five basis points in the average rate paid on deposits for the three months ended March 31, 2017 to 0.36% from 0.31% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase in the average rate paid on deposits is reflective of our efforts to keep our cost of funds as low as possible but still maintain our competitiveness in our market area among other banking institutions. Average interest-bearing deposits were $369.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $373.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The largest increase in interest expense related to expense on money market deposits, which increased $29 thousand, or 58%, to $79 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from $50 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Average money market deposit balances increased $14.2 million from $69 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to $83.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase resulted from a successful money market campaign during the year ended June 30, 2016. The average rate paid on certificates of deposit increased from 0.40% for the three months ended March 31, 2016 to 0.44% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 while average balances decreased from $229.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2016 to $208.4 million for the three-month period ended March 31, 2017. The combination of higher rates and lower volume resulted in a net decrease in interest expense of $2 thousand for certificates of deposit. The average balance of NOW and demand deposits decreased by $87 thousand while the average rate increased four basis points and the average balance of savings deposits increased $2.8 million and average rates increased seven basis points. Table of Contents Net Interest Income. Net interest income before the provision for loan losses decreased by $396 thousand, or 9.2%, to $3.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017.

The lower yield and lower average balance of loans primarily contributed to the decrease in net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Provision for Loan Losses.

There were $34 thousand net charge-offs for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $2 thousand for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The higher provision is due primarily to loan growth. Our total allowance for loan losses was $1.1 million, or 0.35%, of total gross loans, at March 31, 2017 and $922 thousand, or 0.32%, of total gross loans at June 30, 2016.
