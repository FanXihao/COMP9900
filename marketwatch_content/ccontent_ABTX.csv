Further, these forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they were made and we undertake no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which these statements are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events, unless required to do so under the federal securities laws. Other factors not identified above, including those described under the headings Item 1A. ""Risk Factors"" and Item 7. ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,"" may also cause actual results to differ materially from those described in our forward looking statements. Most of these factors are difficult to anticipate and are generally beyond our control. You should consider these factors in connection with considering any forward-looking statements that may be made by us. Overview We generate most of our income from interest income on loans, service charges on customer accounts and interest income from investments in securities. We incur interest expense on deposits and other borrowed funds and noninterest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits and occupancy expenses. Net interest income is the difference between interest income on earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense on liabilities such as deposits and borrowings that are used to fund those assets. Net interest income is our largest source of revenue. To evaluate net interest income, we measure and monitor (1) yields on our loans and other interest-earning assets, (2) the interest expenses of our deposits and other funding sources, (3) our net interest spread and (4) our net interest margin. Net interest spread is the difference between rates earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest margin is calculated as net interest income divided by average interest-earning assets. Because noninterest-bearing sources of funds, such as noninterest-bearing deposits and shareholders' equity, also fund interest-earning assets, net interest margin includes the benefit of these noninterest-bearing sources. Our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, referred to as a ""volume change."" Periodic changes in the volume and types of loans in our loan portfolio are affected by, among other factors, economic and competitive conditions in Texas and specifically in the Houston metropolitan area, as well as developments affecting the real estate, technology, financial services, insurance, transportation, manufacturing and energy sectors within our target market and throughout the state of Texas. Our net interest income is also affected by changes in yields earned on interest-earning assets and rates paid on interest-bearing deposits and borrowed funds, referred to as a ""rate change."" Fluctuations in market interest rates are driven by many factors, including governmental monetary policies, inflation, deflation, macroeconomic developments, changes in unemployment, the money supply, political and international conditions and conditions in domestic and foreign financial markets. On January 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of F&M Bancshares and its wholly-owned subsidiary bank, Enterprise Bank. The results for the year ended 2015 reflect the combined entity. As of December 31, 2014, F&M Bancshares, on a consolidated basis, reported total assets of $569.7 million, total loans of $410.2 million and total deposits of $488.9 million. Because the acquisition closed on January 1, 2015, our historical financial condition and results of operations as of and for periods ended on or before December 31, 2014 contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K do not reflect the financial condition and results of operations of F&M Bancshares. In connection with the acquisition of F&M Bancshares, we incurred approximately $29.3 million in indebtedness, including by borrowing approximately $18.0 million under our revolving credit agreement to repay debt that F&M Bancshares owed to its shareholders and the assumption of junior subordinated debentures with an aggregate original principal amount of $11.3 million issued to two statutory trusts. In addition to the impact of the acquisition of F&M Bancshares, the comparability of our consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 may be affected by our acquisition of Independence Bank, National Association (""Independence"") during the fourth quarter of 2013. The results of the acquired operations of Independence were included in our results of operations for only a portion of 2013, as compared to the full years 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017. We completed an initial public offering of 2,990,000 shares of Allegiance's common stock at $21.00 per share on October 7, 2015, generating net proceeds of $57.1 million. Allegiance's common stock began trading on the NASDAQ Global Market on October 8, 2015 under the ticker symbol ""ABTX."" Critical Accounting Policies Our accounting policies are integral to understanding our results of operations. Our accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 included elsewhere in our annual consolidated financial statements. We believe that of our accounting policies, the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity. Securities Debt securities are classified as available for sale when they might be sold before maturity. Securities available for sale are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses are excluded from earnings and reported, net of tax, as a separate component of shareholders' equity until realized. Securities within the available for sale portfolio may be used as part of our asset/liability strategy and may be sold in response to changes in interest rate risk, prepayment risk or other similar economic factors. Interest earned on these assets is included in interest income. Interest income includes amortization of purchase premium or discount. Premiums and discounts on securities are amortized on the level-yield method, except for mortgage backed securities where prepayments are anticipated. Gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method. Management evaluates debt securities for other-than-temporary impairment (""OTTI"") on at least a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. For securities in an unrealized loss position, management considers the extent and duration of the unrealized loss and the financial condition and near-term prospects of the issuer. Management also assesses whether it intends to sell, or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell, a security in an unrealized loss position before recovery of its amortized cost basis. If either of the criteria regarding intent or requirement to sell is met, the entire difference between amortized cost and fair value is recognized as impairment through earnings. For debt securities that do not meet the aforementioned criteria, the amount of impairment is split into two components as follows: (1) OTTI related to credit loss, which must be recognized in the income statement, and (2) OTTI related to other factors, which is recognized in other comprehensive income, net of applicable taxes. The credit loss is defined as the difference between the present value of the cash flows expected to be collected and the amortized cost basis. The previous amortized cost basis less the OTTI recognized in earnings becomes the new amortized cost basis of the security. Loans Held for Investment Loans held for investment are those that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the principal balance outstanding, net of deferred loan fees and costs, and an allowance for loan losses. Loans are typically secured by specific items of collateral including business assets, consumer assets, and commercial and residential real estate. Commercial loans are expected to be repaid from cash flow from operations of businesses. Interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance. Nonperforming and Past Due Loans Loans are placed on nonaccrual status when payment in full of principal or interest is not expected or upon which principal or interest has been in default for a period of 90 days or more unless the asset is both well secured and in the process of collection. If the decision is made to continue accruing interest on the loan, periodic reviews are made to confirm the accruing status of the loan. Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. When available information confirms that specific loans, or portions thereof, are uncollectible, these amounts are charged off against the allowance. All loan types are considered delinquent after 30 days past due and are typically charged off or charged down no later than 120 days past due, with consideration of, but not limited to, the following criteria in determining the need and optional timing of the charge-off or charge-down: (1) the Bank is in the process of repossession or foreclosure and there appears to be a likely deficiency, (2) the collateral securing the loan has been sold and there is an actual deficiency, Allowance for Loan Losses The allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance that is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for loan losses. The amount of the allowance for loan losses is affected by the following: (1) charge-offs of loans that decrease the allowance, (2) subsequent recoveries on loans previously charged off that increase the allowance and (3) provisions for loan losses charged to income that increase the allowance. Throughout the year, management estimates the probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio to determine if the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb such losses. The allowance for loan losses consists of specific and general components. The specific component relates to loans that are individually classified as impaired. We follow a loan review program to evaluate the credit risk in the loan portfolio. Loans that have been identified as impaired are reviewed on a quarterly basis in order to determine whether a specific reserve is required. The general component covers non-impaired loans and is based on industry and our specific historical loan loss experience, volume, growth and composition of the loan portfolio, the evaluation of our loan portfolio through our internal loan review process, general current economic conditions both internal and external to us that may affect the borrower's ability to pay, value of collateral and other qualitative relevant risk factors. Based on a review of these estimates, we adjust the allowance for loan losses to a level determined by management to be adequate. Estimates of loan losses are inherently subjective as they involve an exercise of judgment. Our allowance for loan losses, both in dollars and as a percentage of total loans, may not be comparable to other similar sized institutions due to the impact of acquisition accounting. As part of acquisition accounting, acquired loans are initially recognized at fair value with no corresponding allowance for loan losses. Initial fair value of the loans includes consideration of expected credit losses. Loans for which the terms have been modified, and for which the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties, are considered troubled debt restructurings and therefore classified as impaired. Subsequent to identification as a troubled debt restructuring, such loans are then evaluated for impairment on an individual basis whereby we determine the amount of reserve in accordance with the accounting policy for the impaired loans as part of our allowance for loan losses calculation. If a loan is impaired, a specific valuation allowance is allocated, if necessary, so that the loan is reported net, at the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's existing rate or at the fair value of collateral if repayment is expected solely from the collateral. Accounting for Acquired Loans At the time of an acquisition, we evaluate loans to determine if they are purchased credit impaired loans. Purchased credit impaired loans are those acquired loans with evidence of credit deterioration for which it was probable at acquisition that we would be unable to collect all contractual payments. We make this determination by considering past due and/or nonaccrual status, prior designation of a troubled debt restructuring or other factors that may suggest we will not be able to collect all contractual payments. Purchased credit impaired loans are initially recorded at fair value with the difference between fair value and estimated future cash flows accreted over the expected cash flow period as income only to the extent we can reasonably estimate the timing and amount of future cash flows. In this case, these loans would be classified as accruing. In the event we are unable to reasonably estimate timing and amount of future cash flows, the loan is classified as non-accrual. An acquired loan previously classified by the seller as a troubled debt restructuring is no longer classified as such at the date of acquisition. Past due status is reported based on contractual payment status. Our purchased credit impaired loans have generally been de minimis and comprised less than 0.01% of our loan portfolio at December 31, 2017. Historically, purchased credit impaired loans have been placed on nonaccrual status and reported as such until we were able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of future expected cash flows. Income associated with purchased credit impaired loans for 2017 and prior periods has been immaterial. All loans not otherwise classified as purchased credit impaired are recorded at fair value with the discount to contractual value accreted over the life of the loan. When determining the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans, we bifurcate the allowance between legacy loans and acquired loans. Loans remain designated as acquired until either the loan is (1) renewed or (2) substantially modified whereby modification results in a new loan. When determining the allowance on acquired loans, the Company estimates principal losses as compared to the Company's recorded investment, with the recorded investment being net of any unaccreted discounts from the acquisition. At December 31, 2017, we had $133.2 million in acquired loans that had not been renewed or substantially modified which is net of an unaccreted discount of $207 thousand or 0.16%. Accrued Interest Receivable Accrued interest receivable represents the amount of interest income on loans that we have earned but the customer has yet to pay. At December 31, 2017, the balance of accrued interest receivable increased $3.2 million compared to December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily due to interest payment deferrals for a period of 90 days that we granted to our borrowers in good standing impacted by Hurricane Harvey to help relieve those customers from a financial burden in addition to loan growth over the prior year-end. Goodwill Goodwill resulting from business combinations is generally determined as the excess of the fair value of the consideration transferred, plus the fair value of any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, over the fair value of the net assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date. Goodwill is assessed annually for impairment or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable. Goodwill acquired in a purchase business combination that is determined to have an indefinite useful life is not amortized, but is tested for impairment. We perform our annual impairment test on October 1st. Goodwill is the only intangible asset with an indefinite life on our balance sheet. Emerging Growth Company Pursuant to the JOBS Act, an emerging growth company can elect to opt in to any new or revised accounting standards that may be issued by the FASB or the SEC otherwise applicable to non-emerging growth companies. We have elected to opt in to such standards, which election is irrevocable. We will likely take advantage of some of the reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are available to us so long as we qualify as an emerging growth company, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation and exemptions from the requirements of holding non-binding advisory votes on executive compensation and golden parachute payments. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements We have evaluated new accounting pronouncements that have recently been issued and have determined that there are no new accounting pronouncements that should be described in this section that will have a material impact the Company's operations, financial condition or liquidity in future periods. Refer to Note 1 of the Company's audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements that have been adopted by the Company or that will require enhanced disclosures in the Company's financial statements in future periods. Results of Operations Net income attributable to common shareholders was $17.6 million, or $1.31 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $22.9 million, or $1.75 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2016, a decrease of $5.2 million, or 22.8%. The decrease in net income was primarily the result of a $7.7 million increase in the provision for loan losses and a $10.7 million increase in noninterest expense partly offset by a $13.8 million increase in net interest income. Net income attributable to common shareholders increased $7.6 million, or 50.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared with $15.2 million, or $1.43 per diluted common share, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Returns on average common equity were 5.92%, 8.36% and 7.43%, returns on average assets were 0.65%, 0.98% and 0.81% and efficiency ratios were 63.89%, 62.34% and 65.27% for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The efficiency ratio is calculated by dividing total noninterest expense by the sum of net interest income plus noninterest income, excluding net gains and losses on the sale of loans, securities and assets (including the sale of the two acquired Central Texas branches in 2016). Additionally, taxes and provision for loan losses are not part of the efficiency ratio calculation. . . . Mar 09, 2018 (c) 1995-2018 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

Recent Developments Table of Contents accruing status of the loan. Nonaccrual loans and loans past due 90 days include both smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment and individually classified impaired loans. Table of Contents we were able to reasonably estimate the timing and amount of future expected cash flows. Income associated with purchased credit impaired loans for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and prior periods has been immaterial. All loans not otherwise classified as purchase credit impaired are recorded at fair value with the discount to contractual value accreted over the life of the loan. When determining the allowance for loan losses on acquired loans, we bifurcate the allowance between legacy loans and acquired loans. Loans remain designated as acquired until either (i) loan is renewed or (ii) loan is substantially modified whereby modification results in a new loan. When determining the allowance on acquired loans, the Company estimates principal losses as compared to the Company's recorded investment, with the recorded investment being net of any unaccreted discounts from the acquisition. At March 31, 2017, we had $176.8 million in acquired loans that have not been renewed or substantially modified, which is net of an unaccreted discount of $604 thousand or 0.34%.

""This was a sound year for Allegiance as we continued to consistently generate loan growth into the fourth quarter, while maintaining solid credit quality and a strong net interest margin,"" said George Martinez, Allegiance's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our fourth quarter earnings were impacted by the recent tax reform bill enacted at the end of December which led to a revaluation of our deferred tax asset resulting in a $2.6 million tax adjustment. We remain focused on the execution of our growth strategies as we further strengthened our capital position through the successful completion of a subordinated debt offering in December. Additionally, we made a strategic decision to implement a new core technology platform in the first half of 2018 to a more integrated technology solution reflective of our vision to better leverage technology to achieve our goals and realize operational efficiencies in our super community banking model. This new platform will not only better position us to meet the current and future needs and demands of our customers, but also enhance the user experience for customers and employees alike,"" continued Martinez. ""I am very pleased with our momentum and achievements over this past year. Among those achievements are robust capital, continued customer growth, and strength in asset quality. We anticipate a sustained focus and continued progress in the coming year toward attaining our strategic goals of high quality growth with improving levels of profitability. As such, I am grateful for our dedicated employees, who add value to our customer relationships and provide superior service and innovation. They ensure a consistent customer experience at Allegiance, just as they have done throughout our 10-year history, and I appreciate their hard work and loyalty,"" concluded Martinez.

The increase in noninterest expense over the year ended December 31, 2016 was primarily due to increased expenses related to the core technology conversion, professional fees and salaries and benefits related to supporting growth initiatives. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Allegiance's efficiency ratio increased to 63.89% from 62.34% for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity were 0.65%, 5.92% and 6.93%, respectively, compared to 0.98%, 8.36% and 9.96%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Excluding the gain on the sale of the two Central Texas branch locations during the first quarter 2016, the returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity for the year ended December 31, 2016 would have been 0.92%, 7.88% and 9.38%, respectively. Financial Condition Total assets at December 31, 2017 increased $409.3 million, or 16.7%, to $2.86 billion compared to $2.45 billion at December 31, 2016 and increased $46.8 million, or 1.7%, compared to $2.81 billion at September 31, 2017. Total loans at December 31, 2017 increased $379.2 million, or 20.0%, to $2.27 billion compared to $1.89 billion at December 31, 2016 and increased $69.3 million, or 3.1%, compared to $2.20 billion at September 30, 2017. These increases were due to strong organic loan growth within the Bank's loan portfolio. Core loans, which exclude the mortgage warehouse portfolio, increased $376.8 million, or 20.7%, to $2.20 billion at December 31, 2017 from $1.82 billion at December 31, 2016 and increased $83.5 million, or 3.9%, from $2.12 billion at September 30, 2017. Deposits at December 31, 2017 increased $343.8 million, or 18.4%, to $2.21 billion compared to $1.87 billion at December 31, 2016 and decreased $72.6 million, or 3.2%, compared to $2.29 billion at September 30, 2017.

GAAP Reconciliation and Management's Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) Allegiance's management uses certain non�^'GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Allegiance believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance. Allegiance believes that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Allegiance's performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods. Specifically, Allegiance reviews tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible equity and the ratio of tangible equity to tangible assets for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, Allegiance excluded the one time sale of two Central Texas branch locations during the first quarter 2016 as noted within the narrative, as Allegiance believes this transaction was not indicative of its recurring operating results. Allegiance has included in this Earnings Release information relating to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which Allegiance calculates the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.

ABTX,"NEW YORK, Nov 29, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) has assigned a senior unsecured debt rating of BBB, subordinated debt rating of BBB-, and short-term debt rating of K3 to Allegiance Bancshares, Inc. ABTX, +0.90% (“Allegiance”), a bank holding company headquartered in Houston, TX. In addition, KBRA has assigned deposit and senior unsecured debt ratings of BBB+, a subordinated debt rating of BBB, and short-term deposit and debt ratings of K2 for its subsidiary, Allegiance Bank (“the Bank”). The Outlook for all long-term ratings is Stable. The ratings are supported by Allegiance’s relatively stable overall performance over a multi-year period and healthy net interest margin. Additionally, the experienced management team with its proficient risk management profile and strong capital management further supports the assigned ratings. The ratings are constrained by Allegiance’s heavily spread reliant revenues, elevated level of construction & development loans, and the inherent risks associated with the Bank’s geographic concentration within a single metro area. The Stable Outlook for the long-term ratings reflects the resilience of Allegiance’s capital and earnings to KBRA’s forward looking economic stress scenarios. Furthermore, the outlook assumes minimal impact on asset quality as a result of Hurricane Harvey, with earnings that return to pre-storm levels in ensuing quarters.

""We are extremely proud of our consistently strong loan growth, even in the wake of the Hurricane. Our provision expense was elevated this quarter in part due to immediate uncertainty in the Houston economy and estimated losses related to Hurricane Harvey. Additionally, during the quarter, we charged off one energy-related loan relationship we had been monitoring for some time. We performed a thorough assessment of the impact of the Hurricane on our customers as well as the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses for our current portfolio,"" added George Martinez.

GAAP Reconciliation and Management's Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) Allegiance's management uses certain non�^'GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Allegiance believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance. Allegiance believes that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Allegiance's performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods. Specifically, Allegiance reviews tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, Allegiance excluded the one time sale of two Central Texas branch locations during the first quarter 2016 as noted within the narrative, as Allegiance believes this transaction was not indicative of its recurring operating results. Allegiance has included in this Earnings Release information relating to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which Allegiance calculates the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.

ABTX, +0.90% (""Allegiance""), the holding company of Allegiance Bank (the ""Bank""), today reported net income of $5.4 million in the second quarter 2017 compared to $5.3 million in the second quarter 2016 and diluted earnings per share for the second quarter 2017 and 2016 of $0.40. ""We are extremely proud to report another record quarter of high-quality organic loan production,"" commented George Martinez, Allegiance's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Our linked second quarter core loan growth of $118.8 million represents an annualized increase of 24.7% and reflects the hard work and dedication of our talented team of legacy lenders who, in collaboration with our recently added lenders, continue to build strong relationships in the vibrant Houston market. At the same time, our asset quality continues to be solid with net charge-offs of 0.13%, which reflects our disciplined underwriting,"" continued Martinez. ""In addition to enhancing our lending team, we have hired key personnel to strengthen our infrastructure and support the operational and regulatory requirements applicable to a larger bank as we pursue our ambitious growth goals. While net income declined in the second quarter 2017 compared to the linked quarter, primarily due to an increased provision for loan loss expense as a result of robust loan growth and prior nonperforming credit relationships, we are pleased to see gains in both efficiency and pre-tax pre-provision earnings in our second quarter 2017 performance,"" concluded Martinez. Second Quarter 2017 Results Net interest income before provision for loan losses in the second quarter 2017 increased $3.2 million, or 14.4%, to $25.1 million from $21.9 million for the second quarter 2016 primarily due to organic loan growth and an increase in our securities portfolio. Net interest income before provision for loan losses in the second quarter 2017 increased $979 thousand, or 4.1%, from $24.1 million in the first quarter 2017. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased 3 basis points to 4.29% for the second quarter 2017 from 4.32% for the second quarter 2016 and decreased 9 basis points from 4.38% for the first quarter 2017.

Noninterest expense for the second quarter 2017 increased $2.5 million, or 18.2%, to $16.5 million from $13.9 million for the second quarter 2016, and decreased $88 thousand, or 0.5%, from $16.5 million for the first quarter 2017. The increase in noninterest expense over the second quarter 2016 was primarily due to increased professional service fees to support growth initiatives. In the second quarter 2017, Allegiance's efficiency ratio decreased to 61.92% from 64.98% for the first quarter 2017 and increased from 60.11% for the second quarter 2016.

The increase in noninterest expense over the six months ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits as a result of the increased headcount and professional service fees related to supporting growth initiatives. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, Allegiance's efficiency ratio increased to 63.41% from 61.93% for the six months ended June 30, 2016.

These increases were due to strong organic loan growth within the Bank's loan portfolio.

GAAP Reconciliation and Management's Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) Allegiance's management uses certain non�^'GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Allegiance believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance. Allegiance believes that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Allegiance's performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods. Specifically, Allegiance reviews tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Additionally, Allegiance excluded the one time sale of two Central Texas branch locations during the first quarter 2016 as noted within the narrative, as Allegiance believes this transaction was not indicative of its recurring operating results. Allegiance has included in this Earnings Release information relating to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented. These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which Allegiance calculates the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.

The first quarter 2016 included a $1.3 million after tax gain on the sale of two Central Texas branch locations that were sold in order to focus on the Houston MSA.  Excluding the gain on the sale of these branches during the first quarter 2016, net income for the first quarter 2017 increased 20.4% and diluted earnings per share for the first quarter 2017 increased 15.4% compared to the same period in 2016.

""We are excited to report another solid quarter driven by a record level of core loan growth that grew at an annualized rate of over 21% in the first quarter. Our continued focus is on leveraging the recruiting successes that we have experienced over the past several quarters. Our success is due in large part to our bankers and to their existing and new customer relationships within the Houston MSA. In addition to adding high quality lenders, we have recruited experienced operations specialists and retained consultants to help us enhance our policies, procedures and infrastructure to position the Bank for continued growth,"" commented George Martinez, Allegiance's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""Credit quality remains a core foundational strength with key metrics remaining favorable. We continue to monitor current events and economic trends that could impact our market and clients. We are fortunate to be located in Houston where customers are continuing to make investments in the increasingly diversified local economy,"" concluded Martinez. First Quarter 2017 Results First quarter 2017 annualized returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity were 0.96%, 8.61% and 10.15%, respectively, compared to 1.19%, 9.70% and 11.67%, respectively, for the first quarter 2016.  Excluding the gain on the sale of two Central Texas branch locations that occurred during the first quarter 2016, the annualized returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity for the first quarter 2016 would have been 0.94%, 7.67% and 9.22%, respectively.  Annualized returns on average assets, average equity and average tangible equity for the fourth quarter 2016 were 0.93%, 8.25% and 9.79%, respectively. Net interest income before provision for loan losses for the first quarter 2017 increased $3.0 million, or 14.4%, to $24.1 million from $21.1 million for the first quarter 2016 primarily due to organic loan growth and an increase in our securities portfolio. Net interest income before provision for loan losses for the first quarter 2017 increased $706 thousand, or 3.0%, from $23.4 million for the fourth quarter 2016. The net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis decreased 7 basis points to 4.38% for the first quarter 2017 from 4.45% for the first quarter 2016, and increased 6 basis points from 4.32% for the fourth quarter 2016.

The first quarter 2016 included a pre-tax gain of $2.1 million on the sale of the two Central Texas branch locations and the fourth quarter 2016 included a gain on the sale of other real estate of $206 thousand.

The increase in noninterest expense over the first quarter 2016 was primarily due to increases in salaries and benefits and professional fees related to supporting growth initiatives. In the first quarter 2017, Allegiance's efficiency ratio increased to 64.98% from 63.80% for the first quarter 2016 and decreased from 65.09% for the fourth quarter 2016.

These increases were due to strong organic loan growth within the Bank's loan portfolio. Core loans, which exclude the mortgage warehouse portfolio, increased $291 million, or 17.8%, to $1.92 billion at March 31, 2017 from $1.63 billion at March 31, 2016 and increased $97.7 million, or 5.4%, from $1.82 billion at December 31, 2016.

GAAP Reconciliation and Management's Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures (Unaudited) Allegiance's management uses certain non�^'GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) financial measures to evaluate its performance. Allegiance believes that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful supplemental information regarding its performance.  Allegiance excluded the one time sale of two Central Texas branch locations during the first quarter 2016 as noted within the narrative, as Allegiance believes this transaction was not indicative of its recurring operating results. Allegiance believes that management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing Allegiance's performance and when planning, forecasting, analyzing and comparing past, present and future periods. Specifically, Allegiance reviews tangible book value per common share, return on average tangible common equity and the ratio of tangible common equity to tangible assets for internal planning and forecasting purposes. Allegiance has included in this Earnings Release information relating to these non-GAAP financial measures for the applicable periods presented.  These non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the most directly comparable or other financial measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Moreover, the manner in which Allegiance calculates the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from that of other companies reporting measures with similar names.

""Safe Harbor"" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995: This release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the securities laws that are based on various facts and derived utilizing important assumptions, present expectations, estimates and projections about Allegiance and its subsidiaries. Statements preceded by, followed by or that otherwise include the words ""believes,"" ""expects,"" ""anticipates,"" ""intends,"" ""projects,"" ""estimates,"" ""plans"" and similar expressions or future or conditional verbs such as ""will,"" ""should,"" ""would,"" ""may"" and ""could"" are generally forward-looking in nature and not historical facts, although not all forward-looking statements include the foregoing words. Forward-looking statements include information concerning Allegiance's future financial performance, business and growth strategy, projected plans and objectives, as well as projections of macroeconomic and industry trends, which are inherently unreliable due to the multiple factors that impact economic trends, and any such variations may be material. Such forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of Allegiance's control, which may cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to whether Allegiance can: continue to develop and maintain new and existing customer and community relationships; successfully implement its growth strategy, including identifying suitable acquisition targets and integrating the businesses of acquired companies and banks; continue to sustain its current internal growth rate; provide quality and competitive products and services that appeal to its customers; continue to have access to debt and equity capital markets; and achieve its performance objectives.

Any forward-looking statement made by Allegiance in this release speaks only as of the date on which it is made.  Factors or events that could cause Allegiance's actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for Allegiance to predict all of them.
