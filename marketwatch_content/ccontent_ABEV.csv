ABEV,"European stocks are on a tear. They’re up 5.5% so far this year, hitting levels not seen since May 2008. U.S. stocks, on the other hand, are little changed. I’m tempted to add to my European stock exposure, given how rich sentiment and valuations are in the U.S., relative to Europe. But is it too late? Not at all, say money managers who are overweight European stocks. “We still like Europe. We think there is a compelling value opportunity there,” NorthRoad Capital Management portfolio manager Raymond Vars told me recently. Chad Deakins, a portfolio manager at the RidgeWorth International Equity Fund STITX, +1.40%  is overweight Europe, especially cyclical companies, the more economically sensitive ones that do better when economies rebound. Of course, Europe appears to face several challenges, from deflation and military conflict in Ukraine, to problems, again, with Greek debt. But that’s what creates the opportunity. Ed Yardeni, an economist and strategist with Yardeni Research, agrees that European bulls are on the right track. “The question is whether the fundamentals are improving enough to boost earnings. Investors seem to think so, and we are coming around to the same opinion,” Yardeni says. To see why, let’s consider six reasons to favor Europe over U.S. stocks, and eight European stocks that look among the best to buy. ‘All the economic indicators are clearly suggesting that a recovery is taking hold once again.’ David Hussey, Manulife Reason 1: European stocks look cheap relative to U.S. stocks. European stocks recently had a forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) of 15.1, compared with 17.5 for the U.S., Yardeni points out. But a lot of European companies trade at much steeper discounts to their U.S. equivalents. “This creates an opportunity for value investors,” says Vars, whose NorthRoad International Fund US:NRIEX outperforms competing funds by an annualized 1.2 percentage points over the past five years, according to Morningstar. While operating margins and profits at U.S. companies are at all-time highs, there’s still a lot of room for improvement in these metrics at European companies, Vars says. “In Europe, there is more basic blocking-and-tackling that can take place.” A return of European profit margins to 2007 peaks, which isn’t out of the question, would move stocks up 20% to 30%, says David Hussey, who oversees European investments in the London offices of Manulife Asset Management. To see why that might actually happen, take a look at the following reasons to favor Europe over the U.S. now. Reason 2: Europe just launched quantitative easing. Like the Fed a few years back, the European Central Bank is now launching a massive quantitative-easing (QE) program. Starting this month, it will buy 60 billion euros, or $66.3 billion, worth of government debt a month until well into 2016, to try to boost growth. “As countries embark on QE or free-money programs, equity markets go up. That’s that,” says John Lekas of Leader Capital. “Europe equity markets are going higher across the board.” Reason 3: The weak euro will boost exports. The euro has fallen sharply from its peak last year, and it may have a bit more to go, says Deakins, whose RidgeWorth International Equity Fund outperformed competitors over the past five years. That’s great for European exporters, since their stuff now looks cheaper to foreigners. “A lot of European companies export a significant amount, and, as the euro has fallen, their earnings have grown.” This is going to continue. In contrast, the strong dollar is a headwind for U.S. exporters. Reason 4: Bank’s are lending more, and not just to one another. Over the three months through January, private-sector lending by financial institutions jumped to 612.8 billion euros at an annualized rate, the best pace since October 2008, Yardeni says. Lending to non-financial companies posted its first gain since November 2011, and mortgage lending rose to 114 billion euros, the most since June 2011. Reason 5: Countries are making reforms that help the economy. Ireland, Spain, Portugal, France and Italy have made varying degrees of progress in lifting regulations and easing job-market rules, changes that can lead to better growth, Yardeni says. Ireland and Spain are now the fastest-growing economies in the European Union. Portugal is improving as well. Reason 6: Despite all the gloomy headlines, European economies are perking up. “All the economic indicators are clearly suggesting that a recovery is taking hold once again,” Hussey says. “This time it won’t be snuffed out by an appreciating currency.” A few data points: Retail sales jumped 3.7% in January from a year earlier. That was the best pace since November 2008, Yardeni says. Wages in Germany recently rose 3.2%. Factory orders were up 2.5% in December from November, the fastest rate since June 2011. Business sentiment and the region’s Purchasing Managers Index have also been rebounding. Stocks liked by investment professionals Koninklijke KPN KKPNY, -1.49% is a Dutch telecom company caught up in the sector’s price wars, which have been encouraged by European regulators. Now regulators favor less cutthroat pricing competition and more consolidation, so that European telecom companies can make enough to invest in next generation of broadband networks, Hussey says. This is one reason he likes the earnings and dividend growth prospects at KPN. He also likes U.K.-based Rio Tinto RIO, +2.65% a diversified mining company whose low costs help explain its prodigious cash flow. The company’s low payout ratio suggests there’s room to raise the dividend. It already offers a 5% dividend yield. Vars, at at NorthRoad Capital Management, likes Akzo Nobel AKZOY, -1.20% an Amsterdam paints and coatings company that’s been closing plants, selling off businesses and carrying out other restructuring to bring down costs. Now all it needs is a rebound in demand. That might be in the cards as the economy picks up. Vars also likes the financial sector, which still trades at a healthy discount to peers elsewhere in the world. One favorite: Amsterdam-based ING Groep ING, +0.06% trading at just over 1 time book value. It has been selling insurance divisions to focus on banking. That’s enabled ING to shore up its balance sheet and reinstate its dividend, which Vars expects to grow substantially. Since Germany is such a big exporter, its economy is one of the main beneficiaries of the weak euro. That’s why Lekas likes German companies. Two favorites are Deutsche Telekom DTEGY, +1.61% and Allianz AZSEY, +0.71% an insurer, in part because they pay decent dividends of 3.8% and 4.4%. Deakins, at RidgeWorth International Equity Fund, likes Paris-based Cap Gemini CGEMY, +0.22% which offers information-technology consulting in Europe and abroad. He also likes Ambev ABEV, +2.25% which makes Budweiser beer, for its brand strength and exposure to emerging markets. Both companies are plays on a continuing rebound in the global economy, not just better European growth. “We are only halfway into this economic cycle, and it will have a number of years of positive growth before things get negative again,” Deakins says. “We will see growth until central banks stop raising rates and they have not even started yet.” If you buy European stocks, expect volatility as problems like the conflict in Ukraine and Greek debt issues flare up. But if you are a real long-term investor like Warren Buffett, you should welcome volatility as Buffett does, since it gives you a chance to add to positions at lower prices.

The company is part of Anheuser-Busch InBEV, the largest global brewery group, which holds approximately 60 percent of the company's outstanding shares. In the past year, shares of Ambev have traded erratically, largely due to political upheaval in Brazil. Large sell-offs typically lined up with major news developments. The stock traded as low as $4.70 in December, but recently hit a one-year high of $6.82. So far, this year, the shares have gained nearly 40 percent.

Brazil was one of the largest beer markets by volume in 2016, reaching an estimated 120 million hectolitres. Beer is primarily sold in bars for on-premise consumption, although beer is also sold in supermarkets for off-premise consumption. The company estimates that its Skol, Brahma, and Antarctica brands comprise two-thirds of the Brazilian beer market. Ambev has a well-diversified portfolio with respect to products and geography. In addition to a dominant position in the Brazilian beer market, the company has a strong foothold in the rest of Latin America and a reliable business in Canada (Labatt).

In Brazil, volumes declined by 4.7%, while NR/hl was up 0.7%.
