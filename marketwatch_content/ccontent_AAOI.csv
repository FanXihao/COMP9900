AAOI,"Acacia Communications Inc. ACIA, +3.22% fell more than 10% in late trading Thursday after disclosing quarterly financial performance, the second consecutive day that an optical-networking company took a big post-earnings hit. The company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $20.4 million, or 52 cents a share, on sales of $86.6 million, down nearly 40% from $142.4 million a year ago. After adjusting primarily for changes to the U.S. tax law and stock-based compensation, Acacia claimed earnings of 27 cents a share, down from 94 cents a share a year ago. Analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of 25 cents a share on sales of $88.4 million. The company's forecast predicts more declines: Acacia sees adjusted earnings of a penny to 10 cents a share in the current quarter on sales of $67 million to $74 million, which would again be stark declines from the year-earlier period. Analysts on average were expecting first-quarter adjusted profit of 28 cents a share on sales of $93.2 million, according to FactSet. Acacia's decline comes a day after Applied Optoelectronics disappointed with its own earnings, and shares of that company declined more than 20% in Thursday trading. Optical-networking companies had been hot amid a data-center boom that required their products. Acacia shares closed Thursday at $41.84, down 37.2% in the past year.","Feb 22, 2018 4:37 p.m. ET",1,Acacia tumbles after earnings as optical networking companies face pressure,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/acacia-tumbles-after-earnings-as-optical-networking-companies-face-pressure-2018-02-22

AAOI,"U.S. equity benchmarks finished the session and the week slightly higher on Friday, and the Nasdaq recorded an all-time high, as President Donald Trump delivered a speech decertifying a nuclear agreement with Iran. Read: The S&P 500 is poised to make stock-market history—for doing almost nothing What did the main benchmarks do? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  rose 30.71 points, or 0.1%, to end at 22,871.72, after notching an intraday all-time high at 22,905.33, aided by gains in American Express Co. AXP, +1.16%  and McDonald’s Corp. MCD, -1.28% The S&P 500 index SPX, +1.38% advanced 2.24 points, or 0.1%, to close at 2,553.17, after hitting an intraday record at 2,557.65. The broad-market index saw its sharpest sector gains in technology and materials, both up 0.5%. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64%  climbed 14.29 points, or 0.2%, to 6,605.80. The technology-laden index booked its 57th record close in 2017. For the week, gains were modest. The Dow industrials recorded a weekly rise of 0.4%, while the S&P 500 saw an 0.2% increase. Both have risen for five straight weeks. The Nasdaq logged a 0.2% weekly advance, marking its third consecutively weekly win. In the year to date, the Dow has gained nearly 15.7%, the S&P 500 is 14%, and the Nasdaq Composite has advanced about 23%. See: Howard Gold on 5 things to do when every investment is too expensive What drove markets? Upbeat earnings reports from banks and the highest consumer-sentiment reading in 13 years supported modest buying. Against that backdrop, the Trump administration said it won’t certify Iran’s compliance with a 2015 nuclear agreement, declaring Tehran a regime that continues to sponsor terrorism and alleging that Iran “intimidated international expectations” sent to inspect it from building up nuclear armaments. Trump laid out a new strategy to deal with Iran and warned that he could cancel U.S. participation in the nuclear pact at any time. The strategy includes placing additional sanctions on the Iran regime to block its “financing of terror,” said Trump. The president also ended billions of dollars in subsidies to insurers under the Affordable Care Act program. The White House said the government can’t lawfully make the payments as there is no appropriation for them. What did the data show? The consumer-price index rose 0.5% in September, the second increase in a row and the largest in eight months. However, economists polled by MarketWatch had forecast a 0.6%. Stripping out volatile food and energy costs, core CPI rose at a much smaller 0.1% rate. A reading on retail sales showed a rise of 1.6% in September, reflecting the largest increase in 2½ years, coming in line with Wall Street expectations. The University of Michigan’s preliminary reading of the consumer-sentiment index for October came in at 101.1, marking its highest level since 2004.

Trump Signs Order Paving Way for Health-Care Changes Check out: MarketWatch’s Economic Calendar What did strategists say? “There’s no reason to sell. Just sit and watch your stuff go up and that’s why trading volumes are low,” said Randy Frederick, managing director at Schwab Center for Financial Research, referring to measures of volatility, notably the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, -12.68% hanging around historic lows, below 10, as stocks test records. Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at BMO Private Bank, said the weaker than expected inflation report reinforced the view that the Fed will take a more tempered approach to tightening monetary policy, even if the central bank appears committed to hiking rates in December. “The weaker than expected inflation results set the stage for some risk taking,” he said. “As long as we have reasonable economic growth with low inflation than the path of least resistance is higher,” he continued. Which Fed speakers were in focus? Outgoing Fed Vice chairman Stanley Fischer said Fed Chairwoman Janet Yellen should serve a second four-year term. “Janet is a safe pair of hands and very good at explaining what she is doing and persuading people of what she’s doing and I think that is critically important,” he said.

AAOI,"There is a sword of Damocles hanging over President Trump’s head. Like him or not, Trump is a man of action. It is natural for him to do his best to remove the sword. The sword, in this case, being the peril of the Russia investigation undertaken by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III, a former FBI director. If Trump does act to have Mueller fired, stocks might crash and gold might soar. To fully understand the potential of that scenario, let us start with a chart. Chart The stock market is in a vulnerable position. Not only are valuations stretched, but there is also a new menacing pattern in the market that deserves investors’ attention. Please click here for an annotated chart. The chart is of the Nasdaq 100 ETF QQQ, +1.83% This ETF contains the leaders of the stock rally, including Facebook FB, +4.42% Apple AAPL, +0.78% Nvidia NVDA, +4.63%  and the like. The chart shows a distribution pattern that likely will continue in the coming weeks. In plain English, a distribution pattern means there is more selling than buying. To learn more about that, please see: “A menacing pattern has revealed itself in the stock market.” Mueller probe Mueller is heading the investigation into possible Trump ties to Russian meddling in the presidential election. He’s also looking into Trump’s business dealings. Please note that I see my job as helping investors, and that I am politically agnostic. This article is about helping you be prepared. Prudent investors plan for potential scenarios in advance. If you’ve ever wondered how successful investors are able to act with conviction before everyone else, this is how it is done. Trump’s red line Trump’s red line is an investigation into his finances. But Mueller is, in fact, probing Trump’s businesses going back a decade. When that news was announced a few days ago, the U.S. dollar immediately fell and gold jumped. Stocks fell on the news, but they recovered as the momo (momentum) crowd took control. However, the dollar did not recover, and gold did not give back its gains. Ask Arora: Nigam Arora answers your questions about investing in stocks, ETFs, bonds, gold and silver, oil and currencies. Have a question? Send it to Nigam Arora. Constitutional crisis The dollar dropped because forward-thinking investors imagined a potential constitutional crisis in the United States. President Trump cannot directly fire Mueller. But his allies in the Justice Department could. Especially if the president fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who has recused himself from the probe, and hired someone who would do his bidding. Republican defections Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham has said there would be “holy hell to pay” if Sessions is fired. If Trump were to find a way to fire Mueller, there would likely be Republican defections. With some Republicans joining Democrats to potentially impeach Trump for obstruction of justice, a constitutional crisis could erupt. Big picture Often those who are too close to the trees have difficulty seeing the forest. Most investors in the United States at this time are oblivious to the impact on the U.S. dollar if the political situation in Washington worsens. However, it is a different story among foreign investors. From the data we gather at The Arora Report from 23 countries, the concern among foreign investors is significant about the U.S. dollar. It appears that foreign investors have a finger on the trigger to sell the dollar. If the dollar is sold aggressively, gold and silver would rocket. Gold might soar Gold and silver are very sensitive to geopolitical events. Gold is priced in dollars. When the dollar falls, gold tends to rise. ETFs of interest are gold ETF GLD, +0.05% silver ETF SLV, +0.33% gold miner ETF GDX, +1.48% junior gold miner ETF GDXJ, +1.48% and leveraged miner ETF NUGT, +3.96% Stocks might crash A rapidly falling dollar would likely make business confidence plunge.

For this reason, the probability of this ugly scenario occurring is somewhat low — for now. My longtime readers know that I rely on algorithms. However, there is not an algorithm that can predict this probability. The best place to look is the dollar — and concern about the dollar. Based on this, the probability of this scenario is about 10%. What to do now Reproduced below is the “what to do now” section from the Morning Capsule that is provided daily to subscribers of The Arora Report. “It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror. “Consider continuing to hold existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider holding cash or Treasury bills 18%-28% and short to medium-term hedges of 15%-25% and very short-term hedges of 15%. “It is worth remembering that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash. When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial-stop quantities for stock positions (non-ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high-beta stocks. High-beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.” Disclosure: Subscribers to The Arora Report may have positions in the securities mentioned in this article or may take positions at any time.

Parabolic move In mathematical terms, a parabola is a curve where any point is at an equal distance from a fixed point called the focus and a fixed straight line called the directrix. In the context of the stock market, a parabolic move simply means that the rate of the stock market gains will increase by a large amount. A parabolic move can be highly profitable. There is potential to make more money in the stock market than has already been made. The signal from the algorithms For market timing and allocation, at The Arora Report we use the adaptive ZYX Global Multi Asset Allocation Model. Adaptive means that the underlying algorithms automatically change with market conditions. The model has macro, fundamental, quantitative and technical inputs in 10 categories. The probability of a parabolic move, according to the algorithm, has been limping along around 0% for a very long time. The probability of a parabolic move has just jumped to 20%. It is due to a combination of different factors. The biggest factor is the way stocks are acting after they report earnings that are better than the whisper numbers and analysts’ consensus numbers. Understanding probabilities In plain English, probability simply means the likelihood of something happening. The probability of getting heads in a fair coin toss is 50%. A probability of 70% means there are 70 chances out of 100 for that event to occur. One of the most important contributions to profitability in your trading will be Nigam’s Second Law of Investing: “Nobody knows with certainty what is going to happen next.” For this reason, the only way to be consistently profitable over a large number of trades, over a long period of time, is to think in terms of probabilities. If anyone tells you any different, run away from them as quickly as you can, as following them will lead to losses over a large number of trades over a long period of time. The safest way to play it One of the safest ways to play the markets if a parabolic move is starting is to use the momentum ETF MTUM. MTUM is already in the ZYX Global portfolio of The Arora Report. Investors may also consider emerging markets of India, Indonesia, Vietnam, China and Russia. These emerging markets have the potential to provide even bigger returns. ETFs of interest are India ETFs EPI, +1.08% INDA, +1.40% and INDY, +1.09% ; Indonesia ETF EIDO, +1.74% ; Vietnam ETF VNM, +0.62% ; China ETF ASHR, +3.58% ; and Russia ETF RSX, +2.66% Those who are inclined to use individual stocks may focus on the following: Amazon AMZN, +1.11% Facebook FB, +4.42% Nvidia NVDA, +4.63% Advanced Micro Devices AMD, +2.45% Applied Optoelectronics AAOI, +5.96% U.S. Steel X, +4.92% Applied Materials AMAT, +2.87% JinkoSolar JKS, +4.29% Microsoft MSFT, +2.10% Alphabet GOOG, +2.71% GOOGL, +3.18% and Apple AAPL, +0.78% What to do now This is a call to be prepared to buy aggressively if the parabolic move starts or the probability of the parabolic move goes higher. The reason is that, historically, such moves happen very quickly. If you have prepared ahead of time, you can act with conviction. To be absolutely clear, this is not a call to start buying now. It is true that the probability of a parabolic move is 20%, but there’s an 80% probability of such a move not occurring. We will be on high alert and carefully monitoring the situation.

AAOI,"Editor’s Note: This is a free edition of The Technical Indicator, a daily MarketWatch subscriber newsletter. To get this column each market day, click here. Though the prevailing backdrop is not one-size-fits-all, the U.S. benchmarks’ bigger-picture technicals, on balance, remain bullish. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 has maintained major support — the familiar 2,405 breakout point — while the Nasdaq Composite’s recently shakier backdrop has incrementally strengthened this week. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, +1.38%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has maintained major support, rising from last week’s low of 2,407. From current levels, the 20-day moving average, currently 2,432, matches an inflection point, and is followed by firmer overhead, circa 2,442. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average remains range-bound. In its case, last week’s low (21,305) precisely matched near-term support. On further strength, the Dow’s next notable resistance matches the June peak of 21,535. The blue-chip benchmark briefly ticked higher last Monday, July 3, tagging record territory during a holiday-shortened session. Meanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite’s COMP, +1.64%  backdrop remains characteristically softer. Still, the index has reversed from six-week lows, reclaiming the 6,164 inflection point, also illustrated on the daily chart below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has edged atop the 6,164 breakdown point, a level closely matching the 50-day moving average, currently 6,171. Recall that the index topped Wednesday at 6,163.6, and Friday at 6,164.9. The upturn punctuates an extended, and technically shaky, retest of major support matching the June low. Based on today’s backdrop, the Nasdaq’s intermediate- to longer-term technical bias remains bullish. Moving to the Dow, the blue-chip benchmark remains characteristically stronger. Recall that last week’s low (21,305) matched near-term support, better illustrated on the hourly chart. Delving deeper, more significant support matches the 21,115 breakout point. The prevailing range is underpinned by consecutive session lows within three points. Similarly, the S&P 500’s price action remains relatively technical. To start, last week’s low (2,407) punctuated a second recent successful test of the 2,405 breakout point. The S&P has subsequently reversed atop the 50-day moving average, currently 2,416, notching consecutive closes higher. The bigger picture Though the U.S. benchmarks’ prevailing backdrop remains slightly divergent — it’s not one-size-fits-all — the bigger-picture market technicals, on balance, remain bullish. On a headline basis, the S&P 500 and the Dow industrials have maintained the range bottom — S&P 2,405 and Dow 21,305 — while the Nasdaq Composite has edged atop the 6,164 resistance, and the 50-day moving average. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, +1.01% has pulled in from the range top and last week’s record close. Tactically, the 50-day moving average, currently 139.25, is closely followed by the range bottom, an area matching last week’s low (138.83). Similarly, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 has pulled in from resistance. Here again, the 50-day moving average, currently 316.25, and the one-month range bottom, technically 314.37, mark technical inflection points. Slightly more broadly, consider that the retests of the 50-day moving average are more a function of the relatively flat preceding 50 sessions, rather than a conventional pullback to the intermediate-term trending indicator. The small- and mid-cap benchmarks are acting well technically, in the broad sweep. Meanwhile, the SPDR Trust S&P 500 SPY, +1.28%  has thus far maintained major support. Recall that the June low of 239.96 effectively matched the 240 breakout point. Last week’s low (240.34) punctuated a second successful retest. Conversely, the 20-day moving average, currently 242.75, has marked an overhead inflection point. More broadly, the SPY’s recent downturn has been fueled by decreased volume. Price action within the prevailing range supports a bullish intermediate-term bias. All told, the Nasdaq Composite thus far weathered a shaky third-quarter start, rising from a nominal six-week low. The 6,164 resistance has marked a hurdle, and Monday’s close higher marks technical progress. The rally attempt’s sustainability, and follow-through, or lack thereof, are worth tracking. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has maintained the familiar 2,405 breakout point. This area broadly matches the 50-day moving average, currently 2,416, and the June FAANG-induced low, also 2,416. Meanwhile, the U.S. sub-sector backdrop remains rotational, also supporting the bull case. For instance, the materials and transports have turned higher, even amid recent technology sector weakness, and with the rate-sensitive sectors under pressure. To the extent the S&P 500 continues to maintain major support, against a rotational sub-sector backdrop, its intermediate- to longer-term bias supports a bullish view. See also: Charting the S&P 500’s stealth breakout attempt as FAANG-fueled downturn fades. Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Initially profiled July 15, 2016, the Materials Select Sector SPDR XLB, +1.92%  has returned 11.7% and remains well positioned. (Yield = 1.8%.) Technically, the group has staged an orderly pullback from all-time highs, maintaining support at the breakout point. Much more broadly, the group has extended the steep January spike to uncharted territory, a move punctuated by consecutive flag-like patterns, illustrated on the four-year chart. Tactically, the breakout point, circa 53.50, closely matches the 50-day moving average, and a posture higher supports a bullish intermediate-term bias. PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, +1.41%  is a well positioned large-cap homebuilder. As illustrated, the shares have edged to 10-year highs, clearing resistance matching the April peak. The slight breakout comes from a tight three-week range — a coiled spring — and has been fueled by a sustained volume increase. More broadly, the former range top closely matched major resistance, illustrated on the 10-year chart. Recent strength opens the path to less-charted territory, and potentially material follow-through. Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. AAOI, +5.96% is a mid-cap manufacturer of fiber-optic marketing products. Technically, the shares have absorbed the June FAANG-fueled downturn (the long red bar), maintaining support matching the breakout point. The ensuing upturn has been fueled by increased volume, positioning the shares for a potential retest of the June peak, a level defining record territory. A posture atop near-term support, circa 67.20, supports a firmly-bullish bias. 58.com, Inc. WUBA, +2.91%  is a large-cap China-based operator of online advertising platforms. As illustrated, the shares have knifed to nine-month highs, rising from trendline support matching the 50-day moving average. Moreover, the breakout has been fueled by a volume spike, positioning the shares to build on the strong-volume late-May rally. Tactically, the breakout point (circa 46.30) pivots to support, and is followed by a deeper floor matching the June peak (44.90). CF Industries Holdings, Inc. CF, +3.40% large-cap fertilizer name coming to life. Specifically, the shares have reached three-month highs — amid increased volume — also clearing the 200-day moving average amid this week’s spike in corn prices. As always, the 200-day is a widely-tracked longer-term trending indicator (in blue, currently 28.80), and in this case, it closely matches a bull-bear inflection point. The recovery attempt is intact barring a violation. Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. ESPR, +0.07% is a well positioned mid-cap biotech name. Late last month, the shares reached 22-month highs, rising after the FDA approved a phase 3 study permitting a combination of Esperion and Dow 30 component Merck & Co. drugs to be used as a cholesterol-lowering treatment. The ensuing pullback has been flat, placing the shares 7% under the June peak. First support matches the breakout point (45.00) and posture higher supports a bullish bias.

AAOI,"It’s hard to find bargains in the technology sector. But using a measure called the PEG ratio — price-to-earnings-to-growth — highlights stocks that could provide big returns for long-term investors. As the eight-year U.S. bull market stretches on, investors can’t be surprised about continual warnings that a correction (a drop of at least 10%) or a bear market (20%) are coming. Those market moves can boost returns for investors with long horizons who pour money into the market every pay period. But some investors fear broad market declines. For them, it can be comforting that, by some measures, valuations are not at a record, and the market is being supported by improved earnings. Don’t Miss: Will the tech rally continue? Hedge funds say yes, but mutual funds say no Here’s how the 11 sectors of the benchmark S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  have performed so far this year, along with estimated year-over-year changes in first-quarter earnings per share from a year earlier: Sector Total return - 2017, through June 7 Estimated first-quarter EPS change Information Technology 22.3% 12.5% Consumer Discretionary 12.8% 5.9% Heath Care 12.6% 3.2% Utilities 12.4% -2.0% Consumer Staples 11.4% 5.4% Materials 8.6% 12.0% Industrials 8.0% 3.2% Real Estate 5.4% -0.8% Financials 1.8% 11.8% Telecommunications -7.6% 1.5% Energy -13.0% 330.7% S&P 500 9.7% 10.6% Sources: FactSet, S&P Global Market Intelligence Many sectors have shown impressive EPS growth, following several years of slow increases or even declines. It’s fair to argue that the bull market has been supported by an incredibly long period of very low interest rates, but improved corporate results are now a catalyst too. This brings us back to the obvious arguments that the market is overvalued. This chart shows the movement of the S&P 500’s forward price-to-earnings ratio (price divided by the consensus EPS estimate for the following fiscal year) since the end of 1999: FactSet You can see that the forward P/E ratio is rather high. But companies that grow their earnings quickly tend to be very popular with investors, and therefore have higher P/E ratios. That is why the PEG ratio — price divided by earnings divided by the expected rate of earnings growth — can be a useful indicator for a first screen. If a company’s PEG ratio is below zero, it may well be undervalued by investors, at the moment, assuming the analysts’ whose estimates feed the ratio are on the money. Also see: The biggest emerging-market ETF doesn’t hold some of the biggest EM stocks Here’s a chart showing the movement of the S&P 500’s PEG ratio (again, based on estimates for the following fiscal year and estimates of earnings growth rates): FactSet The PEG ratio for the S&P 500 is high, but it has been higher for significant periods over the past two years. Now let’s take a look at both ratios for the S&P 500 information technology sector since early 2002 (which is as far back as FactSet can retrieve numbers). First, the forward P/E ratio: FactSet Leaving aside the ridiculous valuations during the tech bubble early this century, the current P/E ratio looks quite high, at least for the bull market that began in March 2009. Then again, it was higher during the years preceding the financial crisis of 2008, and there’s no sign of a financial crisis at the moment. Now the PEG ratio: FactSet The movement of the PEG ratio indicates we have not been in bargain territory for the tech sector as a whole since 2013 (except for one point in 2014). Tech stocks with low PEG ratios To review a broad array of tech stocks, we looked at the S&P Composite 1500 tech sector. (The S&P 1500 comprises the large-cap S&P 500, the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index MID, +1.35%  and the S&P Small-Cap 600 Index SML, +0.99% ) We then narrowed the list to 26 companies with PEG ratios below 1 and majority “buy” ratings from analysts: Company Ticker Industry PEG ratio Price/consensus 2018 EPS estimate Micron Technology Inc.

AAOI,"Here are four U.S. stocks moving on earnings reports, with strong technical momentum. Applied Optoelectronics Inc. AAOI, +5.96% reached a new all-time high on Tuesday, rising by $4.72, or 8.2%, to $62.11 on 5 million shares traded. The move came as company CEO Stefan Murry spoke at a Jefferies technology conference, noting expected growth and demand. On Thursday of last week, the company released earnings that exceeded analysts’ expectations, and on Friday the stock surged nearly 20%, breaking out of a wedge-type consolidation. The rising channel points to a target of around $80, although the stock may be overextended right now and could consolidate in its present range. First Solar Inc. FSLR, +2.39%  was up again on Tuesday, adding another 63 cents, or 2%, at 35.78 on 3 million shares traded. The stock has rapidly ascended from a close of $26.54 on April 19 to an intraday high of $36.21 on Tuesday, spurred by positive reaction to first-quarter earnings released on May 2. If it can make it through its current consolidation zone, breaking above the recent intraday highs near $36.25, price may climb still further to next targets at $38.50, the high from February, followed by $40.50 and then $43. Read: Stock winners and losers — Nvidia rockets and Yelp tumbles Mazor Robotics Ltd. MZOR, +2.82% has exploded for three days in a row ahead of today’s earnings release, rising fast from last Friday’s pullback low of $33.36. On Tuesday the stock closed up $1.51, or 4%, to $39.99, on 1.3 million shares traded, which is more than four times its average volume. The stock, which broke out of an eight-month base in March, is now in a steep, rising channel that points to $43 next, followed by $50. Heavy short interest of 7.2 times its average volume could fuel price appreciation as short-sellers cover on a rally. Boingo Wireless Inc. WIFI, +1.56% reached another all-time high on Tuesday, tacking on an additional 24 cents to $16, on 1.2 million shares traded. The stock has been rallying in recent sessions since reporting better-than-expected earnings on May 4, rising from Thursday’s low of $13.45 to Tuesday’s intraday high of $16.58. With the top of the long-term rising channel just above at around $17, the stock could see some pullback or consolidation before the next move. See Harry’s video-chart analysis on these stocks.

AAOI,"Applied Optoelectronics Inc. proved Wednesday that the boom in optical-networking products is not slowing down as companies build out corporate and cloud-computing data centers. On Tuesday, Applied Optoelectronics AAOI, +5.96%  said its first-quarter results will easily exceed its previous guidance, thanks to the “continued robust demand” for its data center products. The company did not say much beyond its raised guidance and noted it will report final quarterly results on May 4, but the news fueled a 20% jump in its stock in after-hours trading. TimeApplied Optoelectronics Inc.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:AAOI $100 $25 $50 $75 In an investor presentation last month, Applied Optoelectronics executives talked about some of the reasons that were fueling strong demand for its products, comments that gave a window on the current market for fiber-optic components in general. Chief Financial Officer Stefan Murry discussed a major paradigm shift in the data center from copper to optical components, as more companies adopt an open architecture and realize the likely need to expand. He also noted that the transition of data to the cloud is still in its early days, which could mean more data centers will be built by Applied’s customers, which the company’s PowerPoint presentation said includes Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.11%  , owner of cloud-computing leader Amazon Web Services, as well as Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.10%  and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, +2.59%   Those factors would suggest other optical-networking companies could also continue to benefit from the cloud-focused boom for a once-dormant sector, which was evident months ago. Investors were quick to realize that as well Wednesday evening, as optical stocks like Oclaro Inc. OCLR, +1.70%  , Finisar Inc. FNSR, +4.84%  and Lumentum Holdings Inc. LITE, +2.57%  also gained in late trading. Investors have been burned before by fiber-optics companies: Large market caps crashed fast in the dot-com boom’s bust as the first big internet build-out ended abruptly. And even in the current cloud boom, not all companies are finding success, as NeoPhotonics Corp. NPTN, +13.98%  investors found out late last year when it had to cut its forecast. But the news from Applied Optoelectronics is a sign that the cloud boom for the optical-networking sector still has some room to run, and if the data-center build-out is truly in its early days, that runway could be much longer.

AAOI,"U.S. stocks rebounded from a sharp morning selloff, but still closed lower Thursday, with the Nasdaq snapping a seven-day winning streak as investors paused before the start of earnings season and a lack of policy detail in President-elect Donald Trump’s first formal news conference a day ago. Equity markets have been trading mostly sideways as investors begin to question the run-up in stock prices following the election on Trump’s promises of fiscal stimulus. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64% which had been down by as many as 67 points earlier, finished down 16.16 points, or 0.3%, at 5,547.49, retreating from its record close set on Wednesday, and snapping a streak of seven sessions of gains. Biotech rebounded from earlier losses after Trump said drug companies were “getting away with murder” at his Wednesday news conference. On Thursday, the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, +0.72% finished up 0.4%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% closed down 63.28 points, or 0.3%, at 19,891.00, after trading down by as many as 184 points earlier in the session. The declines were broad-based, with 22 of the 30 components trading lower. Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.93%  and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.82% which reports earnings Friday morning, led the losses. The S&P 500 index SPX, +1.38%  fell 4.88 points, or 0.2%, to finish at 2,270.44 with seven out of 11 main sectors trading lower. Financials and energy led the declines. Earlier, the index had been down by as many as 21 points. “The Trump rally has exhausted itself, and it’s natural to see a pullback after a strong advance,” said Joe Saluzzi, partner, co-head of Equity Trading at Themis Trading. “Investors are probably repositioning and getting ready to hear from companies as earnings season begins.” Saluzzi said investors completely shifted their focus to the prospects of fiscal stimulus, after being dependent on the Fed since the financial crisis. “For the past seven years it was all about the Federal Reserve and monetary policy. Investors could count on the Fed to come to the rescue any time stocks fell. Now, it seems like nobody is even paying attention to Fed officials when they speak,” said Saluzzi. Read : What pharma investors ought to do after Donald Trump fires a salvo Thursday’s pullback in equities also come as St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said fiscal proposals discussed by Trump aren’t likely to take hold until 2018 or 2019. He also said the U.S. economic environment remains one in which low interest rates are prevalent.

Oil CLG7, +0.00%  settled up 1.5% at $53.01 a barrel, while gold futures US:GCG7  settled up 0.3% at $1.199.80 an ounce, aided by the U.S. dollar’s slump. European stocks SXXP, +0.44% traded lower, and Asian markets mostly lost ground. Economic news and Fed speakers: The market’s reaction to weekly jobless claims and import prices ahead of the opening bell was subdued. Both data releases pointed to continued improvement in the labor market and an uptick in inflation due to higher oil prices. Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, speaking in Malvern, Pa., said the U.S. economy is “starting 2017 off on a good foot” and three interest rate increases will be appropriate as long as the economy stays on track. Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart reportedly backed two rate increases for the year during a panel discussion in Naples, Fla. St. Louis Fed President James Bullard said the Fed may be in a better position to reduce the size of its balance sheet after two rate increases in the past year in a speech to the Forecasters Club of New York.

AAOI,"If “The Graduate” had been set in the late 1990s, Dustin Hoffman’s young protagonist might have heard these two words of advice: fiber optics. Major leaps forward in the development of fiber optics was a core underpinning of the growth of the internet and helped fuel the optical-networking sector to explode—and then implode—at the turn of the 21st century. Like most component and semiconductor markets, this sector is extremely cyclical—as soon as the first big internet build-out pushed optical-networking companies to outlandish valuations, the cycle ended and they came crashing down amid the massive telecommunications bust. The timing of the current cycle is the big question for investors who are now benefiting from another boom in optical networking, thanks to internet growth in China, new cloud-focused data center infrastructure and big trans-ocean fiber optic cable projects like the one announced in May in development under the Atlantic Ocean by Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.10% and Facebook Inc. FB, +4.42% as well as Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG, +2.71% GOOGL, +3.18%  ongoing Google Fiber installation project. The boom in optical-networking stocks last quarter is unlike anything they’ve experienced since the dot-com bust. In recent months, shares of these optical-networking companies have gained at least 70%, with one more than doubling: Oclaro Corp. OCLR, +1.70% OCLR, +1.70% NeoPhotonics Corp. NPTN, +13.98% Applied Optoelectronics Inc. AAOI, +5.96% Finisar Corp. FNSR, +4.84% and Lumentum Holdings Inc. LITE, +2.57% . Even amid a drought for initial public offerings among tech companies, Acacia Communications Inc. ACIA, +3.22% managed to debut in the sector in mid-May, and that stock is up 233% since. Oclaro Inc.11 Jul25 Jul8 Aug22 Aug5 Sep19 SepSource: Dow Jones Market Data US:OCLR US:NPTN US:AAOI US:FNSR US:LITE 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% In a recent note, Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Silverstein was fully aware that investors are leery of a sector that saw an estimated $1 trillion loss in market value during the dot-com bust. But he still touted the current demand cycle for companies like Oclaro and Applied Optoelectronics and gave many convincing data points in a 58-page initiation report on Oclaro. “At the risk of uttering the four most dangerous words in the investment lexicon, regarding the critical issue of the duration of the current optical upgrade cycle, we think the nature of this cycle is different this time,” Silverstein wrote. He added that, while the nature of the business of these companies is cyclical, the current cycle is too strong to ignore. “To be clear, current end demand and the near-term outlook for optical systems and components is not uniform across all product, customer or regional markets; by extension, nor is it uniform across all vendors,” Silverstein wrote. “That said, virtually all optical industry participants that we met with or heard from cited strong demand and/or underlying demand drivers with no letup in sight.” Indeed, many of these new companies have roots in the first telecom/internet boom and bust, and investors appear to be hoping that their education during one of the most memorable busts will help them proceed more cautiously during another boom time. Oclaro, the big focus of Silverstein’s note, has been led since 2013 by Greg Dougherty, who served briefly as chief operating officer of JDS Uniphase, a company that was the poster child for the incredible rise and disastrous fall of the optical-networking sector. Dougherty joined JDS after one of the biggest mergers of the era, when JDS bought rival SDL, where he was COO, for about $41 billion in stock. Silverstein noted that Dougherty and Chief Financial Officer Pete Mangan “have led a breathtaking turnaround” of a company that is now an “early market leader in the highest growth component of the optical component sector.” JDS Uniphase survived the lean years since the bust, but not entirely intact. Lumentum is the old JDS laser and optical networking components business that was separated from JDS along with Viavi Solutions Inc. VIAV, +2.53% In its most recent earnings call last month, Lumentum CEO Alan Lowe noted that revenue in its 100 gigabit datacom business had surged 241%, while its business selling reconfigurable multiplexers for optical networks was up nearly 100%. Overall, revenue growth in the most recent quarter was 15.7%. “Increasingly, network and data center operators around the world are critically dependent upon our products,” Lowe told analysts in early August. He said demand from China continued to be strong, and full-scale deployments in North American metropolitan areas were ramping up. NeoPhotonics has an even longer history. Initially founded in 1996 to develop nanomaterials, the company became NeoPhotonics in 2002 and spun out its non-telecom businesses. Since 2003, it has been buying companies to expand its technologies, starting with its purchase of Lightwave Microwave Systems. In the past few months, NeoPhontonics has received serious attention on Wall Street, including from Michael Burry, the hedge-fund investor known for his early prediction of the housing market collapse, as chronicled in Michael Lewis’s book “The Big Short.” According to a regulatory filing in August, Burry’s Scion Asset Management bought 300,000 shares of NeoPhotonics as he dumped his Apple stake and loaded up on Alphabet. Last month, at an analyst meeting, the company forecast revenue growth of 25%-plus from 2017 to 2019, as revenue from China and other metro markets surges. “Welcome to the second inning of the Optical Super Cycle,” Alex Henderson, an analyst at Needham & Co., wrote in upgrading NeoPhotonics to a strong buy over the summer. Investors looking for deals in this group may have a hard time after the booming quarter they just experienced. Most of these stocks are now trading at higher growth multiples than other tech holdovers from the dot-com era. Finisar and Lumentum, for example, are trading at 22 times and 26 times 2016 earnings estimates, respectively, while Oclaro trades at about 31 times 2016 estimates. Newly public Acacia trades around 38 times its 2016 estimates, while Applied Optoelectronics is trading at 30 times 2016 estimates and NeoPhotonics is trading at 24.5 times its annual earnings estimates. In addition, investors are likely to remain jittery about this sector after the carnage of 2000-2001. Cowen’s Silverstein, well aware of the potential for skepticism, noted several factors for his call on Oclaro. He said that a few markets for 100 gigabit optical networking components are in the early stages of a multiyear upgrade cycle, and cited Infonetics/IHS market research data that predicts compound annual growth rates of 30% to 60% for certain equipment. Optical networking is a complex sector that is hard to understand for non-techies, and the current prices of many of these stocks may be a deterrent. But if we are still early in a “super cycle,” they could still be worth a look, and investors with a long timeline may want to jump in if these stocks bust yet again.

AAOI,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion and other parts of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, such as statements of our plans, objectives, expectations and intentions. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed in ""Risk Factors."" Overview We are a leading, vertically integrated provider of fiber-optic networking products. We target four networking end-markets: internet data centers, CATV, telecom and FTTH. We design and manufacture a range of optical communications products at varying levels of integration, from components, subassemblies and modules to complete turn-key equipment. In designing products for our customers, we begin with the fundamental building blocks of lasers and laser components. From these foundational products, we design and manufacture a wide range of products to meet our customers' needs and specifications, and such products differ from each other by their end market, intended use and level of integration. We are primarily focused on the higher-performance segments within the internet data center, CATV, telecom and FTTH markets which increasingly demand faster connectivity and innovation. Our vertically integrated manufacturing model provides us several advantages, including rapid product development, fast response times to customer requests and control over product quality and manufacturing costs. The four end markets we target are all driven by significant bandwidth demand fueled by the growth of network-connected devices, video traffic, cloud computing and online social networking. Within the internet data center market, we benefit from the increasing use of higher-capacity optical networking technology as a replacement for copper cables, particularly as speeds reach 10 Gbps and above, as well as the movement to open internet data center architectures and the increasing use of in-house equipment design among leading internet companies. Within the CATV market, we benefit from a number of ongoing trends including the global build-out of CATV infrastructure, the move to higher bandwidth networks among CATV service providers and the outsourcing of system design among CATV networking equipment companies. In the FTTH market, we benefit from continuing PON deployments and system upgrades among telecommunication service providers. In the telecom market, we benefit from deployment of new high-speed fiber-optic networks by telecom network operators. In 2017, our revenue was $382.3 million and our gross margin was 43.5%. We have grown our annual revenue at a compound annual growth rate, or CAGR, of 35.4% between 2009 and 2017. In the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had net income of $74.0 million, $31.2 million and $10.8 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017, our retained earnings was $38.1 million. At December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $37.0 million. In 2017, we earned 80.2% of our total revenue from the internet data center market, and 15.9% of our total revenue from the CATV market. We sell our products to leading OEMs in the CATV and FTTH markets as well as internet data center operators. In 2017, revenue from the internet data center market, CATV market, telecom market and FTTH markets provided 80.2%, 15.9%. 3.4%, and 0.1% of our revenue, respectively, compared to 77.2%, 16.7%, 5.0%, and 0.6% of our 2016 revenue, respectively. In 2017, our key customers in the data center market included Amazon.com (Amazon), Facebook, Inc. (Facebook) and Microsoft Corp (Microsoft). In 2017, 2016, and 2015, Amazon accounted for 35.4%, 54.6%, and 52.5% of our revenue, Facebook accounted for 28.6%, 3.6% and 0.0% of our revenue and Microsoft accounted for 13.8%, 18.3%, and 11.6% of our revenue, respectively. In 2017, our key customers in the CATV market included Cisco Systems, Inc. (Cisco); a large CATV equipment company in China; and Arris Group, Inc. (Arris). In 2017, 2016 and 2015, Cisco accounted for 4.8%, 5.4%, and 10.4%, of our revenue, respectively; our large China-based customer accounted for 3.4%, 1.2%, and 1.0% of our revenue, respectively; and Arris accounted for 3.2%, 5.8% and 4.5%, of our revenue, respectively. Table of Contents In 2017, our revenue growth of 46.6% over the prior-year was driven primarily by demand for our 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps data center transceiver products, as large data center operators continued deployment of high capacity optical interconnect networks within their data centers. Also significant in our results for the year was the increase in orders from our customers for CATV equipment and modules that meet the new DOCSIS 3.1 cable-internet standard. We believe that the increase in these orders is being driven by network upgrades mainly by CATV service providers in North America. We expect continued sales of our 40 Gbps and 100 Gbps products in 2018, and we expect that sales of 100 Gbps products will likely exceed sales of 40 Gbps products. However, quarter-to-quarter results may show considerable variability as is usual in a period of technology transition. Similar to revenue, our gross margins can fluctuate materially depending on a variety of factors including average selling price changes, product mix, raw material cost reduction or increase, manufacturing utilization rate and changes in manufacturing efficiency. Our sales model focuses on direct engagement and close coordination with our customers to determine product design, qualifications, performance and price. Our strategy is to use our direct sales force to sell to key accounts and to expand our use of distributors for increased coverage in certain international markets and certain domestic market segments. We have direct sales personnel that cover the U.S., Taiwan and China focusing primarily on major OEM customers and internet data center operators. Throughout our sales cycle, we work closely with our customers to qualify our products into their product lines. As a result, we strive to build strategic and long-lasting customer relationships and deliver products that are customized to our customers' requirements. Our business depends on winning competitive bid selection processes to develop components, systems and equipment for use in our customers' products. These selection processes are typically lengthy, and as a result our sales cycles will vary based on the level of customization required, market served, whether the design win is with an existing or new customer and whether our solution being designed in our customers' product is our first generation or subsequent generation product. We do not have any long-term purchase commitments (in excess of one year) with any of our customers, most of whom purchase our products on a purchase order basis. Once one of our solutions is incorporated into a customer's design, however, we believe that our solution is likely to continue to be purchased for that design throughout that product's life cycle because of the time and expense associated with redesigning the product or substituting an alternative solution. In 2017, 2016 and 2015, we had 19, 30, and 47 design wins, respectively. We define a design win as the successful completion of the evaluation stage, where our customer has tested our product, verified that our product meets substantially all of their requirements and has informed us that they intend to purchase the product from us. Although we believe that our ability to obtain design wins is a key strength and can provide meaningful and recurring revenue, an increase or decrease in the mere number of design wins does not necessarily correlate to a likely increase or decrease in revenue, particularly in the short term. As such, the number of design wins we achieve on a quarterly or annual basis and any increase or decrease in design wins will not necessarily result in a corresponding increase or decrease in revenue in the same or immediately succeeding quarter or year. For example, if our total number of design wins in an annual or quarterly period increases or decreases compared to the total number of design wins in a prior period, this does not necessarily mean that our revenue in such period will be higher or lower than our revenue in the prior period. In fact, our experience is that some design wins result in significant revenue and some do not, and the timing of such revenue is difficult to predict as it depends on the success of the end customer's product that uses our components. Thus, some design wins result in orders and significant revenue shortly after the design win is awarded and other design wins do not Table of Contents result in significant orders and revenue for several months or longer after the initial design win (if at all). We do believe that over a period of years the collective impact of design wins correlates to our overall revenue growth. We believe we have an attractive financial profile, with strong revenue performance and control over our manufacturing costs through our vertically integrated manufacturing model. While we have incurred substantial losses since our inception, we achieved profitability in 2014, and we continued to be profitable in 2016 and 2017. We have grown our revenue at a 35.4% CAGR between 2009 and 2017, including 46.6% growth year-over-year from 2016 to 2017. Factors Affecting Our Performance Increasing Consumer Demand for Bandwidth. Bandwidth demand in all of our target markets is driving service provider investment in new equipment and in turn generating demand for our products. Increasingly, optical networking technologies are being incorporated into networking equipment, replacing legacy copper-based networking technologies. This shift to optical networking solutions benefits us as a provider of those solutions. Pricing, Product Cost and Margins. Our solution pricing varies depending upon the end market, the complexity of the product and the level of competition. Our product costs also vary with complexity as well as the degree to which we can utilize components designed and manufactured ourselves. We tend to realize higher gross margins on products that incorporate a higher percentage of our own components. We often initially experience lower gross margins on new products, as our pricing is based upon anticipated volume-driven cost reductions over the life of the design win. Thus, if we are unable to realize our expected cost reductions, we may experience declining gross margins on such products. Our product pricing is established when the product is initially introduced to the market, and thereafter through periodic negotiations with customers. We generally do not agree to periodic automatic price reductions. Furthermore, due to the dynamics in the CATV market and the value of our outsourced design services to our customers, we believe we face less downward price pressure than many of our competitors in this market. We sell a wide variety of products among our four target markets and our gross margin is heavily dependent in any quarter on the product mix achieved during that period. Customer Concentration within End Markets. Historically, our revenue has been significantly concentrated, first within the CATV market and in 2016 and 2017 within the internet data center market. Moreover, within these markets, revenue tends to be concentrated among a small number of customers. In 2016 and 2017, we have taken several actions to increase the diversity of our customer base. These actions include hiring additional sales staff to improve our ability to serve new customers and introduction of new products that we believe will appeal to new customers. Furthermore, we have developed additional original design manufacturer, or ODM, relationships with customers in each of our target markets which should enable us to diversify our revenue base. In 2017 and 2016, we had three and two customers that each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue, respectively. Product Development. We invest heavily to develop new and innovative products. The majority of our research and development expense is allocated to product development, usually with a specific customer and customer platform in mind. We believe our close coordination with our customers regarding their future product requirements enhances the efficiency of our research and development expenditures. Discussion of Financial Performance Revenue We generate revenue through the sale of our products to equipment providers for the internet data center, CATV, telecom, FTTH and other markets. We derive a significant portion of our revenue from our top ten customers, and we anticipate that we will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. The following chart provides the revenue contribution from each of the markets we serve for the years 2017, 2016 and 2015, as well as the corresponding percentage of our total revenue for each period (in thousands, except percentages): Table of Contents Years ended December 31, Market 2017 2016 2015 Data Center $ 306,712 $ 201,314 $ 123,286 CATV 60,756 43,567 53,675 Telecom 12,899 12,938 9,652 FTTH 490 1,567 2,458 Other 1,472 1,327 832 Total $ 382,329 $ 260,713 $ 189,903 Percentage of Revenue Data Center 80.2 % 77.2 % 64.9 % CATV 15.9 % 16.7 % 28.3 % Telecom 3.4 % 5.0 % 5.1 % FTTH 0.1 % 0.6 % 1.3 % Other 0.4 % 0.5 % 0.4 % Total Revenue 100 % 100 % 100 %  In 2017, 2016 and 2015, our top ten customers represented 94.9%, 95.5% and 88.7% of our revenue, respectively. Revenue is recognized when the product has shipped and title and risk have transferred to the customer. We bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point. On most orders, our terms of sale provide that title and risk pass to the customer upon placement by us with a common carrier (upon shipment). A majority of our annual sales are denominated in U.S. dollars, but some sales from our Taiwan location and China-based subsidiary are denominated in NT dollars and RMB, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 32.0% of our total revenue was manufactured at our China-based subsidiary, with $13.9 million denominated in RMB and 63.2% of our total revenue was manufactured at our Taiwan-based facility with an immaterial amount denominated in NT dollars. We expect a similar portion of our sales to be denominated in foreign currencies in 2018. Cost of goods sold and gross margin Our cost of goods sold is impacted by variances arising from changes in yields and production volume, as well as increases or decreases in the cost of raw materials used in production. We typically experience lower yields and higher associated costs on new products. In general, our cost of goods sold for a particular product declines over time as a result of increasing efficiencies in the manufacturing processes, or supply cost declines, as well as yield improvements and testing enhancements. We manufacture products in three of our four facilities in the U.S., Taiwan and China. Generally, laser chips and optical components are manufactured in our Sugar Land facility, optical components and subassemblies are manufactured in our Taiwan facility, and optical components and optical equipment are manufactured in our China facility. Because of our vertical integration model, we generally utilize our own optical component products in our semi-finished and finished goods that we sell between and among our respective manufacturing operations. We base those internal sales upon established transfer pricing methodologies. However, we eliminate all of those internal sales, and cost of goods sold transactions, to arrive at total revenue and cost of goods sold on a consolidated basis. We have a global set of suppliers to help balance considerations related to product availability, quality and cost. Components of our cost of goods sold are denominated in U.S. or NT dollars or RMB, depending upon the manufacturing location. Table of Contents Gross profit as a percentage of total revenue, or gross margin, has been and is expected to continue to be affected by a variety of factors, including the introduction of new products, production volumes, the mix of products sold, the geographic region in which products are sold, changes in the cost and volumes of materials purchased from our suppliers, changes in labor costs, changes in overhead costs, reserves for excess and obsolete inventories and changes in the average selling prices of our products. Although our overall gross margins over the past three years have been between 31.8% and 43.5%, our gross margins vary more broadly on a product-by-product basis. Our newer and more advanced products typically have higher average selling prices and higher gross margins; however, until the product volumes scale, the gross margin from newer and advanced products may initially be lower. Within our markets, we may sell similar products to different geographic regions at different prices, and therefore realize different gross margins among those similar products. Our strategy is to improve our gross margins through vertical integration such as utilization of our own laser chips and optical sub-components in our solutions. We expect that our gross margins are likely to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter because of the variety of products we sell and the relative product mix within a quarter. Operating expenses Our operating expenses consist of research and development, sales and marketing, and general and administrative expenses. Personnel costs are the most significant component of operating expenses and include salaries, benefits, bonuses and share-based compensation. With regard to sales and marketing expense, personnel costs also include sales commissions. Research and development. Research and development, or R&D, expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including share-based compensation for R&D personnel, and R&D work orders (that include material, direct labor and allocated overhead), as well as allocated development costs, such as engineering services, software and hardware tools, depreciation of capital equipment and facility costs. We record all research and development expense as incurred. Customers rely upon us to assist them with the development of new products and modification of existing products because of our extensive optical design and manufacturing expertise. We work closely with our customers in the critical design phase of product development and are often reimbursed for those development efforts. By virtue of our overseas R&D operations and by focusing on customer-specific projects, our research and development expenses have tended to represent a lower percentage of revenue compared to some of our competitors. In the future, we expect research and development expense to increase on a dollar basis, but continue to decline as a percentage of revenue, to the extent that our revenue increases over time. Sales and marketing. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including share-based compensation for our sales and marketing personnel, as well as travel and trade show expense, sales commissions and the allocation of overall corporate services and facility costs. We sell our products to customers who either incorporate our products into their offering or resell our products to end customers. Because we sell to a limited number of well-established customers, we employ a limited number of sales professionals who are able to cover large markets. We compensate our sales staff through base salary and commissions, with base salary being the largest component of overall compensation. Total sales commissions to employees amounted to less than one percent of our revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015. Additionally, we pay commissions to third parties on certain product lines and identified customers, which also amounted to less than one percent of our revenue in 2017, 2016 and 2015. As such, our sales and marketing expense does not directly increase with revenue. In the future, we expect sales and marketing expense to increase on a dollar basis as we incrementally increase our overall sales activities, but expect our sales and marketing expense to decline as a percentage of revenue, to the extent our revenue increases over time. General and administrative. General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel costs, including share-based compensation, primarily for our finance, human resources, legal and information technology personnel and certain executive officers, as well as professional services costs related to accounting, tax, banking, legal and information technology services, depreciation of capital equipment and facility costs. We expect general and administrative expense to increase as we continue to grow in both size and complexity as a public company. We expect rising costs including increased audit and legal fees, costs to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations applicable to companies listed on a national stock exchange, as well as investor relations expense and higher Table of Contents insurance premiums. In the future, we expect general and administrative expense to increase on a dollar basis but continue to decline as a percentage of revenue, to the extent that our revenue increases over time. Other income (expense) Interest income consists of income earned on our cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest expense consists of amounts paid for interest on our short-term and long-term debt borrowings. Other income (expense), net is primarily made up of foreign currency transaction gains and losses. The functional currency of our China subsidiary is the RMB and the foreign currency transaction gains and losses of our China subsidiary primarily result from their transactions in U.S. dollars. The functional currency of our Taiwan location is the NT dollar and the foreign currency transaction gains and losses of our Taiwan location primarily result from their transactions in U.S. dollars. Income taxes We are a U.S. registered company and are subject to income taxes in the U.S. We also operate in a number of countries throughout the world, including Taiwan and China. Consequently, our effective tax rate is impacted by the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and the tax laws and regulations in each geographical region. We expect that our income taxes will vary in relation to our profitability and the geographic distribution of our profits. In 2017 our effective tax rate was 12.5%. In 2016 and 2015, our effective tax rate was (48.7%) and 3.3%, respectively. Our effective U.S. federal income tax rate was 0% prior to 2015 as we incurred operating losses and had recorded a full valuation allowance against those losses, which was removed in July 2016. At December 31, 2017, our U.S. accumulated net operating loss, or NOL, was $37.7 million, our federal and state research and development credits were $4.6 million and our foreign tax credits were $2.0 million. If we earn profits in the U.S., we expect to reduce our cash tax obligations by the utilization of NOL carry forwards and tax credits. Our NOL benefits expire over the eight-year period from 2025 to 2032. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an ""ownership change,"" the corporation's ability to use its pre-change NOLs, capital loss carry forwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited going forward. Based upon an analysis of our equity ownership, we have experienced an ownership change; however, our NOL carry forwards and tax credits are not materially limited in dollar amount. The amount of NOL available each year may decrease by the amount of NOL utilized and may increase by the amount of any operating losses incurred. Should we experience additional ownership changes our NOL carry forwards and tax credits may be further limited. Our wholly owned subsidiary, Global Technology, Inc., has received preferential tax concessions in China as a national high-tech enterprise. In March 2007, China's parliament enacted the PRC Enterprise Income Tax Law, or the EIT Law, under which, effective January 1, 2008, China adopted a uniform income tax rate of 25% for all enterprises including foreign invested enterprises. Global Technology, Inc. was recognized as a national high-tech enterprise in 2008 and was entitled to a 15% tax rate for a three year period from November 2008 to November 2011. In 2011 and 2014 Global Technology, Inc. renewed its national high-tech enterprise certificate and therefore extended its three year tax preferential status through September 2017. In November 2017, Global Technology, Inc. again renewed its national high-tech enterprise certificate and therefore extended its three year tax preferential status from November 2017 until November 2020. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had $0.2 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits related to U.S. tax benefits recognized for which we do not meet the more likely than not threshold. We believe that it is reasonably possible that none of our remaining unrecognized tax positions may be recognized by the end of 2018. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act""). The Tax Act makes broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code, including, but not limited to, (1) reducing the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent; (2) requiring companies to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries; (3) generally eliminating U.S. federal income taxes on dividends from foreign subsidiaries; (4) a new provision designed to tax global intangible low-taxed income (GILTI); (5) eliminating the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT) and changing how Table of Contents existing AMT credits can be realized; (6) creating the base erosion anti-abuse tax (BEAT), a new minimum tax; (7) creating a new limitation on deductible interest expense; and (8) changing rules related to uses and limitations of net operating loss carryforwards created in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. Shortly after enactment of the Tax Act, the SEC staff issued SAB 118, which provides guidance on accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. SAB 118 provides a measurement period that should not extend beyond one year from the Tax Act enactment date for companies to complete the accounting under ASC 740. In accordance with SAB 118, a company must reflect the income tax effects of those aspects of the Tax Act for which the accounting under ASC 740 is complete. . . .

AAOI,"SUGAR LAND, Texas, Feb 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. AAOI, +5.96% a leading provider of fiber-optic access network products for the internet datacenter, cable broadband, fiber-to-the-home and telecom markets, announced a 100 Gigabits per second (Gbps) electro-absorption modulated laser (EML) for next generation 400 Gbps optical transceivers. High-speed EMLs are ideal for long distance transmission due to their small chirp and low chromatic dispersion in fiber. The new EMLs operate at 1310-nm, with a symbol rate of 53 Gbaud, and are suitable for use with pulse amplitude modulation, enabling a data rate of 100 Gbps over a single wavelength. Through careful optimization, AOI engineers were able to achieve a very high bandwidth of 38 GHz at 25�C and greater than 32 GHz up to transceiver case temperature of 70�C. The newly developed lasers have demonstrated good 100 Gbps PAM-4 eyes over transceiver case temperature of 70�C with a transmitter dispersion eye closure quaternary (TDECQ) value meeting IEEE 802.3 and 100G Lambda MSA standards. The new lasers are based on AOI's mature high volume and high yield laser production technology, and are suitable for the development of 100G DR1 and 400G DR4/FR4 transceivers for up to 10 Km fiber transmission. Transceivers operating at 400 Gbps can be designed by combining four 100 Gbps lasers, either in a coarse wavelength division multiplexed (CWDM) or parallel single-mode (PSM) arrangement. The resulting transceiver can share a common optical bench platform and similar production techniques as AOI currently utilizes in its production of 100G transceivers. By leveraging this common platform, AOI expects to offer substantial cost and time-to-market advantages over its competitors. ""The 100 Gbps single lambda laser is a key enabling technology for high performance next generation 400G transceivers. With the addition of this new 100 Gbps EML laser and the previously announced 100 Gbps PAM4 directly modulated laser (DML), AOI extends its technological leadership in laser development for cost-effective and high-performance 400G transceivers to longer distance applications, potentially extending beyond the intra-datacenter realm,"" commented Dr. Jun Zheng, Vice President of R&D. AOI will showcase a demonstration of both its 100G single lambda EML and DML March 13-15, 2018 at OFC in San Diego, CA.

AAOI,"SUGAR LAND, Texas, Feb 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Applied Optoelectronics, Inc. AAOI, +5.96% a leading provider of fiber-optic network products for the internet datacenter, cable broadband, fiber-to-the-home and telecom markets, today announced financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended Dec. 31, 2017. ""We achieved revenue in the fourth quarter of $79.9 million, which was slightly below our expectations due to lower demand from our datacenter customers as they continue to evolve their network architectures. While our revenue came in slightly below expectations, I am pleased with our ability to continue to generate strong gross margin even in a price sensitive market,"" said Dr. Thompson Lin, Applied Optoelectronics Inc. founder and CEO. ""Even though we see inventory headwinds with one of our customers and the typical seasonality in Q1 due to fewer production days in China because of the Lunar New Year, we continue to expect the second half of 2018 to be stronger than the first half. We believe we have a strong leadership position in advanced optics, and this belief is bolstered by a large purchase commitment that we disclosed earlier today.""

Forward-Looking Information This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such forward-looking statements reflect the views of management at the time such statements are made. These forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties, as well as assumptions and current expectations, which could cause the company's actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in such forward-looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include but are not limited to: reduction in the size or quantity of customer orders; change in demand for the company's products due to industry conditions; changes in manufacturing operations; volatility in manufacturing costs; delays in shipments of products; disruptions in the supply chain; change in the rate of design wins or the rate of customer acceptance of new products; the company's reliance on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of its revenues; potential pricing pressure; a decline in demand for our customers' products or their rate of deployment of their products; general conditions in the internet datacenter, CATV, FTTH or Telecom markets; changes in the world economy (particularly in the United States and China); the negative effects of seasonality; and other risks and uncertainties described more fully in the company's documents filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. More information about these and other risks that may impact the company's business are set forth in the ""Risk Factors"" section of the company's quarterly and annual reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terminology such as ""believe,"" ""may,"" ""estimate,"" ""continue,"" ""anticipate,"" ""intend,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" ""would,"" ""target,"" ""seek,"" ""aim,"" ""believe,"" ""predicts,"" ""think,"" ""objectives,"" ""optimistic,"" ""new,"" ""goal,"" ""strategy,"" ""potential,"" ""is likely,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""plan"" ""project,"" ""permit"" or by other similar expressions that convey uncertainty of future events or outcomes. You should not rely on forward-looking statements as predictions of future events. All forward-looking statements in this press release are based upon information available to us as of the date hereof, and qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement. Except as required by law, we assume no obligation to update forward-looking statements for any reason after the date of this press release to conform these statements to actual results or to changes in the company's expectations. Non-GAAP Financial Measures We provide non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP net income (loss), and non-GAAP earnings per share to eliminate the impact of items that we do not consider indicative of our overall operating performance. To arrive at our non-GAAP gross margin, we exclude stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring expenses, if any, from our GAAP gross margin. To arrive at our non-GAAP net income (loss), we exclude all amortization of intangible assets, stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring expenses, if any, from our GAAP net income (loss). Included in our non-recurring expenses in Q4 2017 are depreciation on certain equipment undergoing reconfiguration, certain consulting fees, employee severance expenses, and certain non-recurring expenses related to hurricane Harvey. Our non-GAAP earnings per share is calculated by dividing our non-GAAP net income by the fully diluted share count. We believe that our non-GAAP measures are useful to investors in evaluating our operating performance for the following reasons: We believe that elimination of items such as stock-based compensation expense and non-recurring expenses is appropriate because treatment of these items may vary for reasons unrelated to our overall operating performance; We believe that non-GAAP measures provide better comparability with our past financial performance, period-to-period results and with our peer companies, many of which also use similar non-GAAP financial measures; and We anticipate that investors and securities analysts will utilize non-GAAP measures to evaluate our overall operating performance. A reconciliation of our GAAP net income (loss) and GAAP earnings per share for Q4 2017 to our non-GAAP net income (loss) and earnings per share is provided below, together with corresponding reconciliations for the three month period ended December 31, 2016 and the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2017. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered as an alternative to net income (loss), earnings per share, or any other measure of financial performance calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP. Our non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other organizations because other organizations may not calculate such other non-GAAP measures in the same manner. We have not reconciled the non-GAAP measures included in our guidance to the appropriate GAAP financial measures because the GAAP measures are not accessible on a forward-looking basis. GAAP measures that impact our non-GAAP financial measures may include stock-based compensation expense, non-recurring expenses, amortization of intangible assets, unrealized exchange loss (gain), asset impairment charges, and loss (gain) from disposal of idle assets. These GAAP measures cannot be reasonably predicted and may directly impact our non-GAAP gross margin, our non-GAAP net income and our non-GAAP fully-diluted earnings per share, although changes with respect to certain of these measures may offset other changes. In addition, certain of these measures are out of our control. Accordingly, a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measure guidance to the corresponding GAAP measures is not available without unreasonable effort.
