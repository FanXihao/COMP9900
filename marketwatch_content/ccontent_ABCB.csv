ABCB,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- Regulators closed a small bank in Georgia on Friday, bringing the nationwide tally of bank failures up to 10 for the year. The Georgia Department of Banking and Finance closed Ellaville, Ga.-based Central Bank of Georgia and appointed the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. as a receiver. Ameris Bank, based in Moultrie, Ga. will assume the five-branch bank's deposits. Central Bank of Georgia had about $278.9 million in assets and $266.6 million in deposits at the end of last year. Ameris Bank agreed to purchase the failed bank's assets and entered into a loss-sharing agreement with the FDIC on $192.8 million of Central Bank of Georgia's assets. The FDIC estimates that the bank's failure will cost the agency's deposit insurance fund $67.5 million.

Overview The following is management's discussion and analysis of certain significant factors which have affected the financial condition and results of operations of the Company as reflected in the unaudited consolidated balance sheet as of September 30, 2017, as compared with December 31, 2016, and operating results for the three- and nine-month periods ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. These comments should be read in conjunction with the Company's unaudited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere herein. This discussion contains certain performance measures determined by methods other than in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). Management of the Company uses these non-GAAP measures in its analysis of the Company's performance. These measures are useful when evaluating the underlying performance and efficiency of the Company's operations and balance sheet. The Company's management believes that these non-GAAP measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing operations, enhance comparability of results with prior periods and demonstrate the effects of significant gains and charges in the current period. The Company's management believes that investors may use these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate the Company's financial performance without the impact of unusual items that may obscure trends in the Company's underlying performance. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial measures determined in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. Non-GAAP measures include tangible common equity, tangible book value per common share, adjusted operating net income, and adjusted operating net income per diluted share. The Company calculates the regulatory capital ratios using current regulatory report instructions. The Company's management uses these measures to assess the quality of capital and believes that investors may find them useful in their evaluation of the Company. These capital measures may or may not be necessarily comparable to similar capital measures that may be presented by other companies.

Yields on earning assets increased to 4.50% during the third quarter of 2017, compared with 4.35% reported in the third quarter of 2016. During the third quarter of 2017, loans comprised 85.9% of earning assets, compared with 83.6% in the same quarter of 2016. This increase is a result of growth in average legacy loans which increased $1.48 billion, or 51.1%, to $4.38 billion in the third quarter 2017 from $2.90 billion in the same period of 2016. Yields on legacy loans increased to 4.84% in the third quarter of 2017, compared with 4.62% in the same period of 2016. The yield on purchased loans decreased from 6.40% in the third quarter of 2016 to 5.94% during the third quarter of 2017. Accretion income for the third quarter of 2017 was $2.7 million, compared with $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2016. Excluding the effect of accretion on purchased loans, the yield on purchased loans was 5.21% for the third quarter of 2016, compared with 4.79% in the same period of 2017. Yields on purchased loan pools increased from 2.75% in the third quarter of 2016 to 2.91% in the same period in 2017. Management anticipates improving economic conditions and increased loan demand will provide consistent interest income. . . . Nov 09, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

The Company's return on average assets and average shareholders' equity were 1.29% and 11.95%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2017, compared with 1.31% and 13.08%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred pre-tax losses on the sale of premises of $570,000 and $401,000, respectively. Excluding these losses on the sale of premises, the Company's net income would have been $23.5 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2017 and $20.3 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, for the second quarter of 2016.

The higher net interest income is a result of growth in average interest earning assets which increased $1.01 billion, or 18.1%, from $5.57 billion in the second quarter of 2016 to $6.58 billion for the second quarter of 2017. The Company's net interest margin decreased during the second quarter of 2017 to 3.95%, compared with 3.97% during the first quarter of 2017 and 4.01% reported in the second quarter of 2016. Total interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, increased to $73.0 million during the second quarter of 2017, compared with $60.3 million in the same quarter of 2016. Yields on earning assets increased to 4.45%, compared with 4.35% reported in the second quarter of 2016. During the second quarter of 2017, loans comprised 85.0% of earning assets, compared with 82.9% in the same quarter of 2016. This increase is a result of growth in average legacy loans which increased $1.34 billion, or 50.5%, to $3.99 billion in the second quarter 2017 from $2.65 billion in the same period of 2016. Yields on legacy loans decreased to 4.75% in the second quarter of 2017, compared with 4.78% in the same period of 2016. The yield on purchased loans decreased from 6.12% in the second quarter of 2016 to 6.08% during the second quarter of 2017. Accretion income for the second quarter of 2017 was $2.9 million, compared with $4.2 million in the second quarter of 2016. Excluding the effect of accretion on purchased loans, the yield on purchased loans was 4.76% for the second quarter of 2016, compared with 4.89% in the same period of 2017. Yields on purchased loan pools increased from 2.38% in the second quarter of 2016 to 2.94% in the same period in 2017. The yield on purchased loan pools for the second quarter of 2016 was unfavorably impacted by an adjustment to the estimated remaining life of the pools and associated premiums due to accelerated prepayments. Management anticipates improving economic conditions and increased loan demand will provide consistent interest income. The yield on total interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.49% in the second quarter of 2016 to 0.70% in the second quarter of 2017. Total funding costs, inclusive of noninterest bearing demand deposits, increased to 0.52% in the second quarter of 2017, compared with 0.35% during the second quarter of 2016. Deposit costs increased from 0.22% in the second quarter of 2016 to 0.32% in the second quarter of 2017. Non-deposit funding costs decreased from 2.61% in the second quarter of 2016 to 2.20% in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease in non-deposit funding costs was driven primarily by an increased utilization of lower rate short-term FHLB advances. Ongoing efforts to maintain the percentage of funding from transaction deposits have succeeded such that non-CD deposits averaged 82.3% of total deposits in the second quarter of 2017, compared with 83.1% during the second quarter of 2016. Average balances of interest bearing deposits and their respective costs for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016 are shown below:  Three Months Ended Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016 Average Average Average Average (dollars in thousands) Balance Cost Balance Cost NOW $ 1,154,364 0.18 % $ 1,087,442 0.16 % MMDA 1,621,487 0.50 % 1,413,503 0.33 % Savings 278,666 0.06 % 265,936 0.07 % Retail CDs < $100,000 441,556 0.58 % 437,899 0.44 % Retail CDs > $100,000 560,320 0.98 % 439,954 0.71 % Brokered CDs - 0.00 % 5,000 0.64 % Interest-bearing deposits $ 4,056,393 0.45 % $ 3,649,734 0.32 %  Provision for Loan Losses The Company's provision for loan losses during the second quarter of 2017 amounted to $2.2 million, compared with $1.8 million in the first quarter of 2017 and $889,000 in the second quarter of 2016.

The Company's return on average assets and average shareholders' equity were 1.24% and 12.33%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 0.88% and 9.14%, respectively, in the first quarter of 2016. During the first quarter of 2017 and 2016, the Company incurred pre-tax merger and conversion charges of $402,000 and $6.4 million, respectively, as well as pre-tax losses on the sale of premises totaling $295,000 in 2017 and pre-tax gains on the sale of premises of $77,000 in 2016. Excluding these merger and conversion charges and losses and gains on the sale of premises, the Company's net income would have been $21.6 million, or $0.60 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2017 and $16.4 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016.

The higher net interest income is a result of growth in average interest earning assets which increased $1.2 billion, or 24.3%, from $5.1 billion in the first quarter of 2016 to $6.3 billion for the first quarter of 2017. The Company's net interest margin increased during the first quarter of 2017 to 3.97%, compared with 3.95% during the fourth quarter of 2016, but decreased compared with 4.03% reported in the first quarter of 2016. Total interest income, on a tax-equivalent basis, during the first quarter of 2017 was $68.6 million, compared with $55.3 million in the same quarter of 2016. Yields on earning assets increased to 4.38%, compared with 4.36% reported in the first quarter of 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, loans comprised 84.1% of earning assets, compared with 80.1% in the same quarter of 2016. This increase is a result of growth in average legacy loans which increased $1.3 billion, or 52.6%, to $3.7 billion in the first quarter 2017 from $2.4 billion in the same period of 2016. Yields on legacy loans decreased to 4.76% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 4.79% in the same period of 2016. The yield on purchased loans decreased from 6.30% in the first quarter of 2016 to 5.95% during the first quarter of 2017. Accretion income for the first quarter of 2017 was $2.8 million, compared with $2.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. Excluding the effect of accretion on purchased loans, the yield on purchased loans was 5.08% for the first three months 2016, compared with 4.84% in the same period of 2017. Yields on purchase loan pools declined from 3.30% in the first quarter of 2016 to 2.84% in the same period in 2017 due to higher purchase premium amortization reflecting accelerated prepayments. Management anticipates improving economic conditions and increased loan demand will provide consistent interest income. The yield on total interest-bearing liabilities increased from 0.45% in the first quarter of 2016 to 0.57% in the first quarter of 2017. Total funding costs, inclusive of noninterest bearing demand deposits, increased to 0.42% in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 0.33% during the first quarter of 2016. Deposit costs increased from 0.23% in the first quarter of 2016 to 0.28% in the first quarter of 2017. Non-deposit funding costs decreased from 3.14% in the first quarter of 2016 to 1.56% in the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in non-deposit funding costs was driven primarily by an increased utilization of low rate short-term FHLB advances. Ongoing efforts to maintain the percentage of funding from transaction deposits have succeeded such that non-CD deposits averaged 82.5% of total deposits in the first quarter of 2017, compared with 82.6% during the first quarter of 2016. Average balances of interest bearing deposits and their respective costs for the first quarter of 2017 and 2016 are shown below:  Three Months Ended Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 March 31, 2016 Average Average Average Average (dollars in thousands) Balance Cost Balance Cost NOW $ 1,169,567 0.17 % $ 1,137,076 0.17 % MMDA 1,486,972 0.42 % 1,278,199 0.33 % Savings 268,741 0.06 % 251,108 0.07 % Retail CDs < $100,000 444,195 0.51 % 438,122 0.47 % Retail CDs > $100,000 517,354 0.88 % 406,699 0.67 % Brokered CDs - - % 1,099 0.73 % Interest-bearing deposits $ 3,886,829 0.39 % $ 3,512,303 0.31 %  Provision for Loan Losses The Company's provision for loan losses during the first quarter of 2017 amounted to $1.8 million, compared with $1.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $681,000 in the first quarter of 2016.

The Company's allowance for loan losses allocated to legacy loans at March 31, 2017 was $21.0 million, or 0.55% of legacy loans, compared with $20.5 million, or 0.56% of legacy loans, at December 31, 2016. The Company's total allowance for loan losses at March 31, 2017 was $25.3 million, or 0.47% of total loans, increasing from $23.9 million, or 0.45% of total loans, at December 31, 2016.

Service charges on deposit accounts in the first quarter of 2017 increased to $10.6 million, compared with $9.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. Stronger growth in commercial and treasury management accounts contributed to the growth in income, as did growth in core deposit accounts that resulted from the Company's acquisition of JAXB in March 2016. Income from mortgage-related activities continued to increase, from $10.2 million in the first quarter of 2016, to $11.2 million in the first quarter of 2017, as a result of the Company's higher levels of production. Total production in the first quarter of 2017 amounted to $311.8 million, compared with $268.6 million in the same quarter of 2016, while spreads (gain on sale) decreased to 3.45% in the current quarter compared with 4.10% in the same quarter of 2016.

For the quarter ending December 31, 2017, reported results include net income of $9.2 million, or $0.24 per diluted share, compared with $18.2 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016.  The financial results include a charge of $13.4 million to income tax expense related to the valuation of the Company's deferred tax asset, due to the recent tax legislation that reduces the future corporate tax rate for the Company. The Company reported adjusted operating net income of $92.3 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $80.6 million, or $2.32 per diluted share, for 2016.  Adjusted operating net income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $23.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, compared with $22.2 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the same quarter of 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the Company's adjusted operating return on average assets was 1.26%, compared with 1.31% for 2016.  For the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company's adjusted operating return on average assets was 1.20%, compared with 1.34% in the same quarter of 2016.  Commenting on the Company's earnings, Edwin W. Hortman, Jr., Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company, said, ""Our successes in 2017 show the strength of our team and dedication our bankers have to growing our bank in the communities we serve.  During 2017, we grew loans 20% from organic growth within our existing markets and grew core deposits 16%, all while improving our margin by five basis points, exclusive of accretion from prior acquisitions, and improving asset quality.""

Growth in earning assets from internal sources contributed to the increase.  Average earning assets increased 20.7% in 2017 to $6.76 billion, compared with $5.60 billion for 2016.  Although the Company's net interest income increased, net interest margin for 2017, including accretion, declined to 3.95%, compared with 3.99% for 2016.  Yields on earning assets in 2017 were 4.46%, compared with 4.35% in 2016. Accretion income for 2017 decreased to $10.6 million or 2.9% of total revenue, compared with $14.1 million or 4.3%, respectively, for 2016.  Excluding the effect of accretion, the Company's margin for 2017 was 3.79%, compared with 3.74% for 2016.  Yields on all loans, excluding the effect of accretion, increased to 4.63% in 2017, compared with 4.50% in 2016. The Company's net interest margin was 3.94% for the fourth quarter of 2017, down slightly from 3.95% reported for both the third quarter of 2017 and for the fourth quarter of 2016.  Accretion income for the fourth quarter of 2017 decreased to $2.2 million, compared with $2.7 million for the third quarter of 2017, and from $3.4 million reported for the fourth quarter of 2016.  Excluding the effect of accretion, the Company's margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 3.82%, an improvement compared with 3.80% for the third quarter of 2017 and 3.73% for the fourth quarter of 2016. Yields on all loans, excluding the effect of accretion, increased to 4.70% during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with 4.65% in the third quarter of 2017.  Loan production in the banking division during the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $419.8 million, with weighted average yields of 4.89%, compared with $409.2 million and 4.74%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2017 and $498.7 million and 4.37%, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2016.  Loan production in the lines of business (to include retail mortgage, warehouse lending, SBA and premium finance) amounted to an additional $1.5 billion during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.3 billion during the fourth quarter of 2016. Total interest expense for 2017 was $34.2 million, compared with $19.7 million for 2016.  Deposit costs increased during 2017 to 0.34%, compared with 0.24% for 2016.  Noninterest-bearing deposits represented 28.6% of the total average deposits for 2017, compared with 29.1% for 2016.  During the last quarter of the year, the Company regularly sees larger balances in the accounts of its larger commercial and municipal accounts, which accounted for approximately $335 million of the fourth quarter growth.  The Company's deposit costs have grown at such a pace to produce a flat margin but the Company has been successful in generating an aggressive amount of new account growth, which management believes was a successful strategy in 2017.  Anticipated rate increases are likely to move the Company's asset yields higher and allow the Company to continue being aggressive on deposit growth without negatively impacting the margin. Noninterest Income Noninterest income decreased 1.3% in 2017 to $104.5 million, compared with $105.8 million for 2016, the result of flat mortgage and service charges during 2017.  Noninterest retail mortgage revenues were essentially flat during the year at $48.5 million despite an increase in mortgage volume of approximately $93.7 million or 6.7%.  Gain on sale margins tightened during 2017, as they moved from 3.36% in the fourth quarter of 2016 to 3.17% in the fourth quarter of 2017 because of more industry focus on purchase business and higher rates to borrowers.  The Company increased volume sufficient to make up for the tighter gains on sale, but late season hiring of mortgage bankers impacted profitability which increased by only 10.8%.  Management expects faster growth in profitability in 2018 from higher volumes, steady levels of operating expense and full utilization of its government loan program endorsement.  During 2017, the Company originated approximately $547 million of government loans with only 11.9% being in the Company's own GNMA securities. Service charges for the year were also flat, coming in at $42.1 million compared to $42.7 million for 2016.  Declining counts of consumer oriented accounts with the associated balances and revenues were offset by larger commercial accounts, generally with enough balances to offset the analysis charges.  Management believes the Company's service charge routines on consumer and commercial accounts is competitive but is focused more heavily on attracting the balances to fund anticipated loan growth in the coming quarters. Revenues from the Company's warehouse lending division decreased slightly during the year, from $7.8 million for 2016 to $7.6 million for 2017, while net income for the division increased 4.8%, from $4.1 million for 2016 to $4.3 million for 2017.  Revenues and profitability slowed for the retail mortgage division in the fourth quarter, which is traditionally a slower time of the year.  Net income for the Company's retail mortgage division was $2.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $3.0 million in the third quarter of 2017 and $1.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016.  Net income for the Company's warehouse lending division was $1.4 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared with $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2017 and $904,000 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Revenues from the Company's SBA division continued to increase during 2017, rising from $8.9 million for 2016 to $10.0 million for 2017.  Net income for the division increased to $3.9 million for 2017, compared to $2.8 million for 2016. Noninterest Expense Noninterest expense increased $16.1 million, or 7.5%, to $231.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $215.8 million for the year 2016.  However, the Company incurred various expenses related to the new premium finance division that was added late in 2016, compliance-related charges due to exiting the Bank Secrecy Act (""BSA"") consent order, losses on the sale of bank premises, merger-related charges and Hurricane Irma expenses.  Excluding these amounts, expenses in 2017 increased by only $7.5 million, or 3.7%, compared with 2016 levels.  Growth of noninterest expense in the retail mortgage, warehouse lending and SBA lines of business account for 41% of that increase, leaving core bank noninterest expense increasing only $4.4 million, or 2.8%. The following table shows the detail of these charges and analysis: Noninterest Expense Analysis         Twelve Months Ended    Dec  Dec     (dollars in thousands) 2017  2016  $ Change  % Change Total noninterest expense $ 231,936   $ 215,835   $ 16,101   7.5 % Less:        Merger and conversion charges 915   6,376   (5,461)   (85.6)%  Certain compliance resolution expenses 5,163   5,750   (587)   (10.2)%  Financial impact of Hurricane Irma 410   —   410   NM  Loss on sale of premises 1,264   992   272   27.4 % Premium finance division noninterest expense 14,295   315   13,980   NM  Subtotal 209,889   202,402   7,487   3.7 % Less:        Retail mortgage division noninterest expense 41,084   38,402   2,682   7.0 % Warehouse lending division noninterest expense 795   832   (37)   (4.4)%  SBA division noninterest expense 4,100   3,675   425   11.6 % Core bank noninterest expense $ 163,910   $ 159,493   $ 4,417   2.8 % NM denotes not meaningful        Salaries and benefits increased $13.2 million, or 12.3%, during 2017.  The majority of this increase is attributable to $4.5 million salary and benefit expense in the new premium finance division, $3.3 million salary and benefit expense related to the strengthening of the Company's BSA department, and $2.3 million additional salary and benefits in the retail mortgage division.  Exclusive of these three areas, salary and benefits increased $3.0 million, or 4.0%. Occupancy costs decreased $328,000 during 2017, principally as a result of management's cost saving efforts during the year.  Data processing and IT-related costs increased $3.3 million, or 13.3%, in 2017 due to increased number of accounts and products, as well as customer's increased reliance on mobile and internet oriented products and services. Credit resolution related expenses decreased $2.7 million, or 43.4%, year over year as credit quality continues to improve.  Other noninterest expenses increased $7.6 million, or 19.6% during 2017, mostly attributable to costs associated with the new premium finance division.  Excluding the other noninterest expense in that division and the BSA compliance resolution charges in both years, other noninterest expense decreased $168,000, or 0.5% to $32.7 million during 2017, when compared to $32.9 million in 2016. Balance Sheet Trends Total assets increased $964.2 million, or 14.0%, during 2017.  Total loans, including loans held for sale, purchased loans and purchased loan pools, were $6.24 billion at the end of 2017, compared with $5.37 billion at the end of 2016.  Organic growth in loans totaled $941.0 million, or 20.3%, during 2017, compared with $660.4 million, or 20.8%, in 2016.  As expected, loan growth rates in the fourth quarter of 2017 slowed to 10.1% on an annualized basis, compared with 12.1% on an annualized basis in the same quarter of 2016. During the quarter, the Company sold or reclassified to loans held for sale approximately $119.5 million of mortgage loans from purchased loan pools, reducing the investment in purchased loan pools to $328.2 million, down 42% compared to the same period in the year ago period.  Management expects the reinvestment of these funds at current yields to boost the margin by approximately three basis points and the Company's return on assets by two basis points. Loan production and growth associated with the new premium finance division continue to meet forecasted levels.  Loans outstanding for the division grew $112.0 million, or 30.2%, from $370.6 million at the end of 2016 to $482.5 million at the end of 2017.  Relationship development of larger agencies and mid-tier insurance companies began producing volumes at the end of the year that gives management confidence in the continued growth of this line of business.  Yields in the business were mostly steady during the year despite rising rates, the Company's aggressive growth posture and the increasing volume of larger loans with established agencies and commercial customers. Deposits increased $1.05 billion during 2017 to end the year at $6.63 billion, from $5.58 billion at the end of 2016.  At December 31, 2017, noninterest-bearing deposit accounts were $1.78 billion, or 26.8% of total deposits, compared with $1.57 billion, or 28.2% of total deposits, at December 31, 2016.  Non-rate sensitive deposits grew $342.4 million or 10.8% to $3.52 billion at December 31, 2017, compared with $3.17 billion at the end of 2016.  These funds represented 53.1% of the Company's total deposits at the end of 2017, compared with 56.9% at the end of 2016. Growth in deposits at the end of the year, along with the Company's sale of mortgage loans from purchased loan pools lowered the loan to deposit ratio from 101.0% at the end of the third quarter of 2017 to 91.3% at December 31, 2017.  Accelerating growth in deposits has continued for several quarters and management is increasingly confident that organic growth in existing markets, augmented by the anticipated growth achievable in the Atlanta MSA will provide adequate core funding to allow for continued growth without impacting our current operating ratios. Stockholders' equity at December 31, 2017 totaled $804.5 million, an increase of $158.0 million, or 24.4%, from December 31, 2016.  The increase in stockholders' equity was the result of the issuance of shares of common stock in the Company's public offering in the first quarter of 2017, plus earnings of $73.5 million during 2017, offset by dividends paid to shareholders of $14.9 million.  Tangible book value per share was $17.86 at the end of 2017, up 23.9% from $14.42 at the end of 2016.  Tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets was 8.62% at the end of 2017, compared with 7.46% at the end of 2016.

(""Hamilton""), the parent company of Hamilton State Bank, Hoschton, Georgia.  Upon completion of the transaction, and including the previously announced acquisition of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation, the combined company will have approximately $11.3 billion in assets and a branching network across four states. ""Atlanta is the largest market in Georgia and one of the largest markets in the entire Southeast.  While we have had a small presence in Atlanta for a number of years, we have been looking for an opportunity to expand our presence in this important market.  We have known Bob Oliver and his team for many years and believe their culture and banking philosophy are very similar to our own.  We believe that partnering with Bob and his team and the low-cost core deposit franchise that they have built is a fantastic way to jump start our Atlanta strategy,"" commented Edwin W. Hortman, Jr., Executive Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ameris. Formed in 2004, Hamilton has $1.8 billion in assets and currently operates 28 banking locations, 24 of which are located within the Atlanta MSA, two of which are in the Gainesville, Georgia MSA and the other two of which are in Georgia just outside of the Atlanta MSA. In recent years, Hamilton has combined its acquisition strategy with a focus on organic growth in its commercial business-line to become the fifth largest independent community bank in the Atlanta MSA.  Combined with Ameris's existing Atlanta location, the combined bank will have approximately $1.4 billion of deposits in the Atlanta MSA and be the thirteenth largest bank in the market. Robert C. Oliver, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Hamilton, said, ""I am excited to have our team join an exceptional institution in Ameris. Like ourselves, Ameris prides itself on being a strong community bank.  We look forward to being able to serve our customers with the full suite of products and capabilities offered by Ameris."" Under the terms of the definitive merger agreement, each share of Hamilton common stock and each restricted stock unit will be converted into the right to receive 0.16 shares of Ameris common stock and $0.93 in cash. The consideration mix is approximately 90% stock and 10% cash.  The transaction is valued at approximately $405.7 million in the aggregate based on Ameris's closing stock price of $53.45 as of January 25, 2018. The merger agreement has been unanimously approved by the board of directors of each company.

ABCB,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan 23, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (Atlantic Coast or the Company, NASDAQ: ACFC): Portfolio loans increased $118 million since December 2016. Deposits increased $47 million during the last 12 months. Nonperforming assets declined 27% to $9.5 million year over year. Entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ameris Bancorp on November 16, 2017. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (Atlantic Coast or the Company, NASDAQ: ACFC), the holding company for Atlantic Coast Bank (the Bank), today reported a loss per diluted share of $0.04 and earnings per diluted share of $0.21 for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with earnings of $0.13 and $0.42 for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The results for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, included a charge of $1.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, related to a reduction in the valuation of the Company's net deferred tax assets caused by the recently enacted tax legislation, which reduces the future statutory corporate income tax rate, and $0.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of merger-related costs. Commenting on the Company's results, John K. Stephens, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Aside from the impact of the new tax legislation on our deferred tax assets, which was anticipated as Congress began to consider reduced corporate income tax rates last fall, the fourth quarter demonstrated continued strength throughout our franchise. During the past year, total loans increased 16% while deposits increased 8%, with both reflecting the success of our strategies to increase our presence and visibility across our markets. Meanwhile, credit quality continued to improve, as indicated by an ongoing decline in nonperforming assets – both in total and relative to total assets. With this progress, we proudly look back on the Company's performance and accomplishments in 2017."" Separately, Stephens noted the Company's recent announcement to be acquired by Ameris Bancorp in a transaction that is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals, along with other customary conditions. ""We are excited about the prospects of joining forces with Ameris and together becoming the largest community bank in the Jacksonville market. We believe there is a good cultural fit between our two banks, which means that our customers will continue to see a strong commitment to high-touch service while benefiting directly from the additional resources and capabilities offered by Ameris."" Other significant highlights of the fourth quarter of 2017 and the full year included: Net interest income was $7.2 million and $27.0 million for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with $7.1 million and $26.5 million for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Net interest margin was 3.24% and 3.20% for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with 3.30% and 3.12% for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Total loans (including portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment) increased 16% to $842.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $727.0 million at December 31, 2016. The Company's loan growth since December 31, 2016, was driven primarily by increased commercial real estate lending in all of its markets. This growth was supplemented by strategic loan purchases, somewhat offset by mortgage loan sales as part of the Company's interest rate risk and balance sheet management strategies and decreases in warehouse loans held-for-investment. Deposits increased 8% to $675.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $628.4 million at December 31, 2016. Deposits, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, increased 15% to $639.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $558.0 million at December 31, 2016. Wholesale funding, which includes brokered certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, decreased 4% to $249.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $259.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-brokered deposits and resulting reduced reliance on wholesale funding was driven primarily by the Company's commercial deposit strategies put in place during 2016. Total assets increased to $983.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $907.5 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in portfolio loans and warehouse loans held-for-investment, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and loans held-for-sale. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, declined to 0.97% at December 31, 2017, from 1.44% at December 31, 2016. Due to the Company's generally stable credit quality during 2016 and continuing throughout 2017, reflecting an overall slowing pace of loan reclassifications to nonperforming, the Company’s loan loss provision remained at a low level for both the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, while maintaining, in management's view, a stable ratio of allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans. The Bank's ratios of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 (core) capital to adjusted total assets were 12.51% and 9.66%, respectively, at December 31, 2017, and each continued to exceed the levels required by regulation, currently 10% and 5%, respectively, for a bank to be considered well-capitalized. Tracy L. Keegan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, ""It was gratifying to see net interest margin increase 8 basis points during 2017, reflecting the success of the operating strategies we implemented this past year to grow loans and noninterest-bearing deposits, resulting in a more diversified balance sheet."" Commenting on the revaluation adjustment made on the Company's net deferred tax assets, Keegan said ""The charge of $1.6 million was recorded as an increase in income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017. Deferred tax assets and liabilities occur due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. With the new tax legislation passed in December 2017, the Company's net deferred tax assets are now expected to be settled at a statutory rate of 21% rather than the statutory rate of 35% used previously to value these deferred tax assets."" Keegan also noted that the Company incurred merger-related costs of approximately $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Bank Regulatory Capital   At Key Capital Measures Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 Total risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 12.51 % 14.83 % Common equity tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.42 % 13.58 % Tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.42 % 13.58 % Tier 1 (core) capital ratio (to adjusted total assets) 9.66 % 9.44 % The decrease in risk-weighted capital ratios at December 31, 2017, compared with December 31, 2016, reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets due to growth in portfolio loans and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, as well as an increase in the risk weighting of certain portfolio loan categories, partially offset by an increase in equity due to accumulated earnings. The charge to remeasure net deferred tax assets, together with merger related expenses, reduced the Company's Tier 1 (core) capital ratio as of December 31, 2017, by approximately 20 basis points.   Credit Quality At Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Nonperforming loans $ 7.8 $ 10.1 Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.02 % 1.57 % Other real estate owned $ 1.7 $ 2.9 Nonperforming assets $ 9.5 $ 13.0 Nonperforming assets to total assets 0.97 % 1.44 % Troubled debt restructurings performing for less than 12 months under terms of modification [ (1)] $ 15.2 $ 14.6 Troubled debt restructurings performing for more than 12 months under terms of modification $ 15.7 $ 20.3   _________________________ (1) Includes $5.9 million and $7.9 million of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Nonperforming assets have declined for five consecutive quarters as the Company's overall credit quality remained stable and the general pace of loans reclassified to nonperforming remained slow during the last 12 months. Importantly, OREO declined significantly as of December 31, 2017, compared with that at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the sale of a $2.4 million foreclosed property in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the foreclosure of a $1.6 million property in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was expected to occur and had been fully reserved for prior to the foreclosure.     Provision / Allowance for Loan Losses At and for the Three Months Ended   At and for the Year Ended   Dec. 31, 2017   Sept. 30, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Provision for portfolio loan losses $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.7 $ 0.6 Allowance for portfolio loan losses $ 8.6 $ 8.4 $ 8.2 $ 8.6 $ 8.2 Allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans 1.12% 1.12% 1.26% 1.12% 1.26% Allowance for portfolio loan losses to nonperforming loans 110.43% 88.16% 80.38% 110.43% 80.38% Net charge-offs (recoveries) $ 0.0 $ (0.0) $ 0.0 $ 0.3 $ 0.2 Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average outstanding portfolio loans (annualized) 0.02% (0.01)% 0.02% 0.04% 0.03%   Net charge-offs totaled $39,000 and $38,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, while net recoveries totaled $18,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017. This reflects a trend of solid economic conditions across the Company's markets, which has led to continued low levels of net charge-offs during the last 12 months. The Company's provision for portfolio loan losses has remained within a relatively narrow range over the past year. However, it was up $185,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the fourth quarter last year, and was up $74,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, versus full year 2016. The increase in the allowance for portfolio loan losses at December 31, 2017, compared with that at December 31, 2016, was attributable primarily to loan growth, which reflected organic growth supplemented by strategic loan purchases that were offset partially by loan sales, principal amortization, and increased prepayments of one- to four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans. Management believes the allowance for portfolio loan losses at December 31, 2017, is sufficient to absorb losses in portfolio loans as of the end of the period. Net Interest Income   Three Months Ended   Year Ended Dec. 31, 2017   Sept. 30, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Net interest income $ 7.2 $ 6.8 $ 7.1 $ 27.0 $ 26.5 Net interest margin 3.24 % 3.18 % 3.30 % 3.20 % 3.12 % Yield on investment securities 2.09 % 2.05 % 2.29 % 2.25 % 2.11 % Yield on loans 4.47 % 4.31 % 4.40 % 4.33 % 4.37 % Total cost of funds 1.03 % 0.98 % 0.78 % 0.93 % 0.92 % Average cost of deposits 0.85 % 0.80 % 0.66 % 0.77 % 0.62 % Rates paid on borrowed funds 1.83 % 2.02 % 1.14 % 1.88 % 1.70 % The slight decrease in net interest margin during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2016, reflected an increase in rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds, with little to no change in rates on new loans due to highly competitive lending conditions. In addition, margin remains relatively stable given the improved mix in core deposits and growth in noninterest-bearing accounts. The increase in net interest margin during the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected a decrease in rates paid on funds due to an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, and an increase in higher-margin interest-earning assets outstanding, reflecting the Company's ongoing redeployment of excess liquidity to grow its portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment. Noninterest Income / Noninterest Expense / Income Tax Expense   Three Months Ended   Year Ended Dec. 31, 2017   Sept. 30, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Noninterest income $ 1.3 $ 1.2 $ 1.9 $ 7.0 $ 9.2 Noninterest expense $ 6.4 $ 6.1 $ 6.0 $ 25.6 $ 25.1 Income tax expense $ 2.5 $ 0.6 $ 1.0 $ 4.6 $ 3.6 The decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans and loans held-for-sale, as well as reduced service charges and fees. The decrease in noninterest income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of investment securities, lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans, reduced service charges and fees, and a decrease in miscellaneous operating income related to an escrow account that was forfeited in 2016 in connection with an OREO sale, partially offset by higher gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale. The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected an increase in compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, and merger-related costs associated with the proposed merger with Ameris Bancorp, partially offset by reduced foreclosed asset expense and a decrease in data processing expenses. The increase in noninterest expense during the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected an increase in compensation and benefits, increased data processing expenses associated with efforts to improve the Company's IT infrastructure, an increase in occupancy and equipment expense, and the aforementioned merger-related costs, partially offset by the positive impact of an adjustment to the rate of accrual for FDIC insurance premiums, reducing the amount accrued for the full year, and a decrease in collection expense. The increase in income tax expense for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected the impact of newly enacted tax legislation, partially offset by a decline in income before income tax expense. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Core earnings and core earnings per diluted share exclude the effects of certain transactions that occurred during the period, as detailed in the following reconciliation of these measures.

Atlantic Coast's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Atlantic Coast's management also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures aid investors in analyzing the Company's business trends and in understanding the Company's performance. In addition, the Company may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes.

Ademi & O'Reilly, LLP alleges Atlantic Coast's long-term financial outlook is improving and yet Atlantic Coast shareholders will receive the equivalent of $9.32 per Atlantic Coast common share or approximately $145 million in the aggregate.  Ameris is well aware of Atlantic Coast's improving financial metrics and is purchasing Atlantic Coast at a substantial discount. The merger agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for Atlantic Coast by (i) prohibiting solicitation of any further bids, and (ii) imposing a termination penalty should Atlantic Coast receive and accept a superior bid. Atlantic Coast insiders, their affiliates and other major shareholders own significant voting stock, and will receive millions of dollars as part of change of control arrangements, and therefore can unduly influence a sale of Atlantic Coast. Our investigation centers on the conduct of Atlantic Coast's Board of Directors, who have unanimously approved the transaction, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for Atlantic Coast given its current financial condition and prospects.

ABCB,"MOULTRIE, Ga., Oct. 19, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ameris Bancorp ABCB, +0.86% (the ""Company"") today reported net income of $20.2 million, or $0.54 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, compared with $21.6 million, or $0.61 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016.  For the year-to-date period ending September 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $64.4 million, or $1.74 per diluted share, compared with $53.9 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, for the same period in 2016.  Results for the quarter were affected by additional charges associated with Bank Secrecy Act compliance, as well as expenses from the impact of Hurricane Irma. The Company reported adjusted operating net income of $23.6 million, or $0.63 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, compared with $21.7 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2016.  The Company reported adjusted operating net income of $68.7 million, or $1.86 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared with $58.4 million, or $1.69 per diluted share, for the same period of 2016.  Adjusted operating net income excludes certain after-tax costs associated with compliance-resolution charges, expenses resulting from Hurricane Irma and acquisitions and sales of premises, as shown in the following summary of the adjustments between reported net income and adjusted operating net income:  Three Months Ended  Nine Months Ended Adjusted Operating Net Income Reconciliation September2017  September2016  September2017  September2016         Net income available to common shareholders $             20,158  $                  21,557  $                  64,398  $               53,923         Merger and conversion charges 92  -  494  6,359 Certain compliance-resolution expenses 4,729  -  4,729  - Financial impact of Hurricane Irma 410  -  410  - Losses (gains) on the sale of premises 91  238  956  562 Tax effect of management-adjusted charges (1,863)  (83)  (2,306)  (2,422) Plus: After tax management-adjusted charges 3,459  155  4,283  4,499        Adjusted Operating Net income 23,617  21,712  68,681  58,422         Reported net income per diluted share: $                 0.54  $                      0.61  $                      1.74  $                  1.56 Adjusted operating net income per diluted share: $                 0.63  $                      0.62  $                      1.86  $                  1.69         Reported return on average assets 1.07%  1.35%  1.20%  1.19% Adjusted operating return on average assets 1.26%  1.36%  1.28%  1.29% Commenting on the Company's quarterly results, Edwin W. Hortman, Jr., the Company's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""During the quarter, we incurred a substantial amount of expense to resolve BSA compliance issues in an accelerated fashion.  Excluding this expense, our operating results were strong.  Our margin, excluding accretion income, expanded by approximately three basis points, we had core loan growth of almost $313 million, or 24% annualized, and our average deposits were 12% higher in the current quarter than a year ago."" Highlights of the Company's performance and results for the third quarter of 2017 include the following: Adjusted operating return on average assets of 1.26% and adjusted return on average tangible equity of 14.28% Organic loan growth of $312.9 million for the quarter, reflecting an annualized growth rate of 24.3% Excluding accretion, increases in net interest margin of 3 bps to 3.80% in the third quarter of 2017, from 3.77% in the second quarter of 2017 and 5 bps improvement from 3.75% in the third quarter of 2016 Growth in average deposits during the third quarter of 2017 to $5.84 billion, an increase of 11.8%, or $615.9 million, over the same period in 2016 9.2% increase in total revenue, to $93.9 million, in the third quarter of 2017, compared with total revenue of $85.9 million in the third quarter of 2016 Increase in tangible book value per share to $17.78, compared with $17.24 per share at June 30, 2017 Adjusted operating efficiency ratio, on a tax-equivalent basis, essentially flat at 61.09% in the third quarter of 2017 Steady capital ratios despite strong growth rates, with tangible common equity to tangible assets equal to 8.81% at September 30, 2017, compared with 8.84% at June 30, 2017 Net Interest Income and Net Interest Margin The Company's net interest margin, excluding the effect of accretion, improved during the quarter to 3.80%, compared with 3.77% in the second quarter of 2017.  Compared with the same quarter in 2016, net interest margin has improved by five basis points while average earning assets grew $1.11 billion over this period.  Net interest income (taxable equivalent) for the third quarter of 2017 totaled $68.7 million, an increase of $10.6 million, or 18.3%, compared with $58.0 million reported for the third quarter of 2016.  Accretion income in the current quarter decreased to $2.7 million, compared with $2.9 million in the second quarter of 2017 and $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2016.  Higher levels of net interest income resulted mostly from growth in average loans outstanding of approximately $1.09 billion since the third quarter of 2016.  Average balances of short-term assets and investments, as a percentage of average earning assets, decreased to 14.1% for the current quarter, from 16.4% for the same quarter in 2016.  At the current quarter's end, loans outstanding represented 86.1% of total earning assets, compared with 83.9% at September 30, 2016. Interest income on a tax-equivalent basis increased to $78.1 million in the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $15.0 million, or 23.7%, from the same quarter in 2016.  Yields on total earning assets moved higher during the quarter to 4.50%, compared with 4.45% for the second quarter of 2017 and 4.35% for the third quarter of 2016.  Yields on all loans, excluding the effect of accretion, increased to 4.65% in the current quarter of 2017, compared with 4.59% in the second quarter of 2017 and 4.49% in the third quarter of 2016.  Loan production in the banking division during the third quarter of 2017 totaled $463.7 million, with weighted average yields of 4.77%, compared with $527.8 million and 4.56%, respectively, in the second quarter of 2017 and $568.3 million and 4.14%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2016.  Loan production in the lines of business (to include retail mortgage, warehouse lending, SBA and premium finance) amounted to an additional $1.6 billion during the third quarter of 2017. Interest expense during the current quarter of 2017 increased to $9.5 million, compared with $5.1 million in the same quarter in 2016.  The Company's cost of funds increased slightly to 0.57% in the third quarter of 2017 as compared with 0.52% in the second quarter of 2017.  The cost of deposits increased to 0.35% in the third quarter of 2017, compared with 0.32% in the second quarter of 2017.  Interest expense on non-deposit borrowings increased during the quarter to $4.3 million, compared with $3.7 million in the second quarter of 2017.  Overall costs on these funding sources decreased from a rate standpoint over the quarter, but the Company's use of these sources has increased from 10.6% of total funding in the second quarter of 2017 to 11.9% in the third quarter of 2017.  Management is comfortable with the current level of non-deposit borrowings, particularly in light of an accelerating pace of deposit growth and the shorter incremental duration of the loan portfolio in certain specialty lines of business. Non-interest Income Non-interest income in the third quarter of 2017 was $27.0 million, a decrease from the $28.9 million reported in the third quarter of 2016.  Service charges in the third quarter of 2017 were $10.5 million, a decrease of $823,000, or 7.3%, compared with the same quarter in 2016.  Service charge-related revenues on commercial and consumer accounts increased, while NSF fee income continued to decline. Revenue from the Company's retail mortgage operations was $16.5 million, an increase of 4.4% compared with the same quarter in 2016, but flat compared with the second quarter of 2017.  Net income for the Company's retail mortgage division increased 6.9% during the third quarter of 2017 to $3.0 million, compared with $2.8 million in the third quarter of 2016.   However, profitability for the retail mortgage division in the third quarter declined compared with the second quarter of 2017 due to increased compensation costs and recruiting costs associated with hiring 15 additional mortgage production officers during the quarter.  Total retail production during the current quarter was $401.7 million, compared with $410.8 million in the third quarter of 2016.  Spreads (gain on sale) on the Company's production decreased to 3.30% in the current quarter, compared with 3.69% in the same quarter of 2016.  Open pipelines at the end of the quarter were $158.4 million, compared with $174.3 million at the beginning of the third quarter of 2017 and $145.4 million at the end of the third quarter of 2016.  Net income for the Company's warehouse lending division decreased during the quarter, from $1.4 million in the third quarter of 2016 to $1.1 million in the third quarter of 2017.  Loan production decreased from $1.1 billion in the third quarter of 2016 to approximately $957.3 million in the current quarter.  The decline in profitability is attributable to an increase of $121,000 in the division's provision for loan loss expense and $262,000 of additional cost of funds allocated to the division. Revenues from the Company's SBA division were $2.1 million during the third quarter of both 2017 and 2016.  However, primarily due to reduced provision for loan loss expense, net income for the division increased 9.7% from $668,000 for the third quarter of 2016 to $734,000 for the third quarter of 2017.  Revenues from the Company's premium finance division were strong, increasing 49.6% (annualized) to $6.5 million in the third quarter of 2017.  Growth in the premium finance division's outstanding balances as well as quarterly production have exceeded management's expectations and contributed to the division's net income for the current quarter of $1.8 million.  The Company continues to recruit sales officers and support staff to support the division and believes that these attractive growth rates can be sustained into 2018 and 2019. Non-interest Expense During the third quarter of 2017, the Company recorded $5.3 million of management adjusted non-operating expenses, most of which were centered in an additional $4.7 million of compliance-related charges and $410,000 of hurricane-related charges, compared with an aggregate of $238,000 for similar expenses recorded in the third quarter of 2016.  Excluding these charges, operating expenses increased approximately $5.4 million, to $58.4 million, from $53.0 million in the third quarter of 2016.  The additional compliance-related charges resulted from the completion of certain look-back procedures that were required by the FDIC for the Company's compliance with its consent order relating to Bank Secrecy Act matters. Expenses associated with the Company's new division, US Premium Finance, were $3.6 million in the third quarter of 2017 and represented the majority of the total increase in operating expenses against the same quarter of 2016.  Additionally, the Company incurred approximately $488,000 of operating expenses related to the new equipment finance line of business and approximately $1 million of recurring operating expenses (compensation and consulting charges) associated with the expanded staffing and processes in BSA.  Salaries and benefits increased by $4.6 million, or 16.4%, to $32.6 million in the current quarter of 2017, compared with $28.0 million in the third quarter of 2016.  Increases in salaries and benefits from the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2017 relating to the Company's ongoing Bank Secrecy Act compliance efforts, expenses associated with the addition of the premium finance division and expenses resulting from the addition of the equipment finance line of business were $1.1 million, $1.3 million and $421,000, respectively.  Higher incentive accruals for the Company's production staff, as well as increased commissions in the mortgage and SBA divisions, accounted for the remaining increase in compensation costs.  Occupancy costs were flat at approximately $6.0 million during the current quarter of 2017 compared with the same quarter in 2016.  Tighter controls on expenses were the principal drivers of minimal increases in these costs.  Data processing and telecommunications costs remained stable, at approximately $7.0 million, compared with the second quarter of 2017, but increased by 14.0% compared with the third quarter of 2016.  Total credit costs (provision and non-provision credit resolution-related costs) totaled $3.1 million in the third quarter of 2017, compared with $2.3 million in the same quarter in 2016 and $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2017. Balance Sheet Trends Total assets at September 30, 2017 were $7.65 billion, compared with $6.89 billion at December 31, 2016 and $7.40 billion at June 30, 2017.  Loans, including loans held for sale, totaled $6.09 billion at September 30, 2017, compared with $5.37 billion at December 31, 2016 and $5.82 billion at June 30, 2017.  During the quarter, growth in core loans (legacy and purchased non-covered loans) increased by $312.9 million, or 24.3%, on an annualized basis.  Growth in core loans (legacy and purchased non-covered loans) for the year-to-date period in 2017 totaled $802.8 million, or 23.1% on an annualized basis, compared with $534.6 million, or an annualized growth rate of 22.4%, for the same period in 2016.  The Company's efforts to manage a diversified loan portfolio have resulted in concentration levels that are solidly below the regulatory guidance.  Loans held for sale, which includes both residential mortgage and SBA-guaranteed loans, decreased $9.4 million during the third quarter of 2017.  Loan production and growth associated with the new premium finance division continue to meet forecasted levels.  Loans outstanding for the division grew $11.3 million, or 9.5% annualized, from $476.6 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017 to $487.9 million at the end of the third quarter of 2017.  Lending activity in the Company's new equipment finance line of business, which provides financing for heavy equipment in the manufacturing, transportation and construction sectors, increased during the third quarter of 2017, resulting in outstanding balances of $49.4 million at the end of the quarter, compared with $15.9 million at the end of the second quarter of 2017.  The line of business finished the quarter with approved and unfunded credit totaling $92.2 million, with an additional active pipeline of $90.3 million.  Management expects additional approvals through the remainder of the year and that usage on approved lines will increase and support the Company's overall growth goals for the remainder of 2017 and into early 2018. Investment securities at the end of the third quarter of 2017 were $867.6 million, or 12.3% of earning assets, compared with $852.2 million, or 13.5% of earning assets, at December 31, 2016.  At September 30, 2017, total deposits amounted to $5.90 billion, or 86.7% of total funding, compared with $5.58 billion and 89.8%, respectively, at December 31, 2016.  Non-interest bearing deposits at the end of the current quarter were $1.72 billion, or 29.1% of total deposits, compared with $1.57 billion, or 28.2%, at December 31, 2016.  Non-rate sensitive deposits (including non-interest bearing, NOW and savings) totaled $3.21 billion at September 30, 2017, compared with $3.17 billion at the end of 2016.  These funds represented 54.4% of the Company's total deposits at September 30, 2017, compared with 56.9% at the end of 2016. Shareholders' equity at September 30, 2017 totaled $801.9 million, compared with $646.4 million at December 31, 2016.  The increase in shareholders' equity was the result of the issuance of shares of common stock in the Company's public offering in the first quarter of 2017, plus earnings of $64.4 million during the first nine months of 2017.  Tangible book value per share at September 30, 2017 was $17.78, up 23.3% from $14.42 at the end of 2016.  Tangible common equity as a percentage of tangible assets was 8.81% at the end of the third quarter of 2017, compared with 7.46% at the end of 2016.
