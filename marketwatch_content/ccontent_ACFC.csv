ACFC,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Management's Discussion and Analysis (this MD&A) is provided as a supplement to, should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified in its entirety by reference to, the Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying Notes of the Company appearing elsewhere in this Report (the Notes). General Description of Business The Company and the Bank have traditionally focused on attracting deposits and investing those funds primarily in loans, including commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences and home equity loans. Additionally, the Bank invests funds in multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans, and commercial and residential construction loans. The Bank also invests funds in investment securities, primarily those issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies or entities, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and other interest-earning assets, such as investment securities. To a lesser extent, revenue is generated from service charges, gains on the sale of loans and other income. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms, which generally include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and money market, and time deposit accounts with terms ranging from three months to five years. Deposits are primarily solicited in the Bank's market areas of the Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia to fund loan demand and other liquidity needs; however, late in 2015 the Bank also started soliciting deposits in Central Florida. See Item 1. Business and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data in this Report for further information related to financial condition and results of operation. Business Strategy Overview Our primary objective is to operate a community-oriented financial institution, serving customers in our market areas while providing stockholders with a solid long-term return on capital. Accomplishing this objective will require financial strength based on a strong capital position and the implementation of business strategies designed to keep the Company profitable consistent with safety and soundness considerations. The Company's operating strategies are focused on increasing revenues from traditional small business commercial lending, including SBA and USDA lending activity, mortgage banking through the Bank's internal mortgage loan origination platform, and warehouse loans held-for-investment origination. In addition, the Company will focus on a conservative credit culture designed to keep nonperforming assets at a low level. Finally, the Company will seek to increase non-maturity deposits through added customer relationships to improve our cost of funds and to help further reduce our cost structure. Management has pursued, and plans to continue to pursue, various options to aid in the steady improvement of the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The following are the key elements of our business strategy: Increasing Revenue By Continuing to Focus on Commercial Lending to Small Businesses, Continuing to Build Our Internal Mortgage Originations, and Growing Our Warehouse Loans Held-For-Investment Operations. In 2014, the Bank began emphasizing increased production in commercial lending to small businesses. As a result, at December 31, 2017, our commercial real estate and commercial business loans totaled $298.7 million, or 39.3% of our loan portfolio. Since the beginning of 2014, the Bank has emphasized the origination of one- to four-family residential mortgage loans in Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia, and expanded into Central Florida in the beginning of 2015. At December 31, 2017, our one- to four-family residential loan portfolio was $286.7 million, or 37.8% of our loan portfolio. Additionally, during 2012, management shifted our business model to include an emphasis on growth in warehouse loans held-for-investment lending. � Commercial lending strategy. Management plans to increase commercial business lending and owner-occupied commercial real estate lending with an emphasis on small businesses. The Bank intends to participate in government programs relating to commercial business loans, such as the programs administered by the USDA and the SBA. The Company generally sells the guaranteed portion of SBA and USDA loans to investors at attractive premiums. Our focus on owner-occupied commercial real estate loans will be to professional service businesses. The Bank does not intend to originate or purchase higher risk loans, such as commercial real estate development projects or land acquisition and development loans. � Internal mortgage originations strategy. Early in 2014, the Bank reentered the business of originating one- to four-family residential loans for investment, and intends to continue originating such loans internally. Additionally, the Bank intends to originate one- to four-family residential loans for sale on the secondary market to supplement noninterest income. � Warehouse loans held-for-investment lending strategy. In the latter part of 2009, the Bank began a program for warehouse loans held-for-investment lending where we finance lines of credit secured by one- to four-family residential loans originated under purchase and assumption agreements by third-party originators and hold a lien position for a short duration (usually less than 30 days) while earning interest and often a fee until a sale is completed to an investor. During 2012, management started emphasizing growth in this business by expanding relationships with existing counterparties, as well as establishing relationships with new counterparties. The Bank expects to continue modestly expanding this aspect of mortgage banking in the future. Continuing Our Proactive Approach to Keeping Nonperforming Assets at a Low Level Through Aggressive Resolution and Disposition Initiatives. As a result of management's proactive strategy, our nonperforming assets were $9.5 million at December 31, 2017. Management plans to continue to use a proactive strategy to keep nonperforming assets at a low level through loan workout programs with borrowers and enhanced collection practices. � A conservative charge-off policy.Management utilizes a conservative charge-off strategy for one- to four-family residential mortgage loans and home equity loans by taking partial or full charge-offs in the period that such loans became nonaccruing, generally when loans are 90 days or more past due. � Loan workout programs with borrowers.The Bank is committed to working with responsible borrowers to renegotiate loan terms. The Bank had $30.9 million in TDRs (including $15.7 million of TDRs performing for more than 12 months under the modified terms) at December 31, 2017. TDRs avoid the expense of foreclosure proceedings and holding and disposition expenses of selling foreclosed property and provide us increased interest income. � Nonperforming asset sales. As a part of the Bank's workout program, the Bank continues to accept short sales of residential property by borrowers where such properties are sold at a loss and the proceeds of such sales are paid to us when this action represents the least costly resolution for the Company. Also, when necessary, in order to reduce the expenses of the foreclosure process, including the sale of foreclosed property, the Bank may sell certain nonperforming loans through national loan sales of distressed assets, which may mitigate future losses. During 2017, the Bank did not sell any nonperforming assets through bulk distressed asset sales and does not intend to use bulk distressed asset sales in the near future. � Credit risk management. The Bank is committed to enhancing credit administration by improving internal risk management processes. In 2010, an independent risk committee of the Bank's Board of Directors was established to evaluate and monitor system, market and credit risk. In 2012, the Bank established a broad problem asset resolution program and developed enhanced asset workout plans for each criticized asset. Strengthening Our Retail Franchise By Growing Noninterest-bearing Deposits and Reducing Our Overall Cost of Deposits. We believe a successful retail franchise results from a strong core customer base that focuses on noninterest-bearing deposits within an overall deposit strategy that offers interest rates that are competitive to its markets, but in line with the overall interest rate environment. Therefore, we remain committed to generating lower-cost and more stable noninterest-bearing deposits and offering our customers other deposit products with interest rates that are fair and meet their financial needs. The Bank complements its attractive deposit products with excellent customer service and a comprehensive marketing program. The Bank will continue to build a core customer base by offering noninterest-bearing and other non-maturity deposits to individuals, businesses and municipalities located in our market areas. Our noninterest-bearing deposits were $63.9 million at December 31, 2017. The average cost of deposits (interest expense on deposits as compared to total average deposits) for the full year of 2017 was 0.77%. In addition to improving our interest rate spread, noninterest-bearing deposits also contribute noninterest income from account related services. Reducing Our Expense Base. In order to improve the Company's profitability, we continue to emphasize expense reduction initiatives in order to reduce operating costs that do not add value to our other business strategies. We intend to continue this focus in order to eliminate non-value added expenses and activities. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies are important to the presentation of the Company's financial condition, because they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, performance of the economy, financial condition of borrowers, and laws and regulations. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include: (i) determining the allowance and provision expense; (ii) measuring for impairment in TDRs; (iii) determining the fair value of investment securities; (iv) determining the fair value of OREO; and (v) accounting for deferred income taxes. Allowance for Portfolio Loan Losses An allowance is maintained to reflect probable incurred losses in the loan portfolio. The allowance is based on ongoing assessments of the estimated losses incurred in the loan portfolio and is established as these losses are recognized through provision expense charged to earnings. Generally, portfolio loan losses are charged against the allowance when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan balance is confirmed. Subsequent recoveries, if any, are credited to the allowance. The reasonableness of the allowance is reviewed and established by management, within the context of applicable accounting and regulatory guidelines, based upon its evaluation of then-existing economic and business conditions affecting the Bank's key lending areas. Senior credit officers monitor those conditions continuously and reviews are conducted quarterly with the Bank's senior management and Board of Directors. The allowance was $8.6 million, or 1.1%, and $8.2 million, or 1.3%, of total portfolio loans outstanding at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The provision expense for each quarter of 2017, 2016 and 2015, and the total for the respective years is as follows:  2017 2016 2015 (Dollars in Millions) First quarter $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 Second quarter 0.2 0.2 0.2 Third quarter 0.2 0.2 0.2 Fourth quarter 0.2 0.1 0.2 Total provision for portfolio loan losses (1) $ 0.7 $ 0.6 $ 0.8  (1) May not foot due to rounding. The amount of the allowance and related provision expense can vary over long-term and short-term periods. Changes in economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, and individual borrower conditions can dramatically impact the required level of allowance, particularly for larger individually evaluated loan relationships, in relatively short periods of time. The allowance allocated to individually evaluated loan relationships was $0.5 million at both December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Given the constantly shifting real estate market coupled with changes in borrowers' financial condition, changes in collateral values, and the overall economic uncertainty that continues to persist, management believes there could be significant changes in individual specific loss allocations in future periods as these factors are difficult to predict and can vary widely as more information becomes available or as projected events change. The allowance is discussed in further detail in Note 1. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies of the Notes contained in this Report. Troubled Debt Restructurings Portfolio loans for which concessions have been granted as a result of the borrower's financial difficulties are classified as a TDR and, consequently, an impaired loan. TDRs are measured for impairment based upon the present value of estimated future cash flows using the loan's interest rate at inception of the loan or the appraised value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent. Impairment of homogeneous portfolio loans, such as one- to four-family residential loans, that have been modified as TDRs is calculated in the aggregate based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Portfolio loans modified as TDRs with market rates of interest are classified as impaired portfolio loans. Once the TDR loan has performed for twelve months in accordance with the modified terms it is classified as a performing impaired loan. TDRs which do not perform in accordance with modified terms are reported as nonperforming portfolio loans. The policy for returning a nonperforming loan to accrual status is the same for any loan, irrespective of whether the loan has been modified. As such, loans which are nonperforming prior to modification continue to be accounted for as nonperforming loans (and are reported as impaired nonperforming loans) until they have demonstrated the ability to maintain sustained performance over a period of time, but no less than six months. Following this period such a modified loan is returned to accrual status and is classified as impaired and reported as a performing TDR. Fair Value of Investment Securities Investment securities available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with unrealized holding gains and losses reported separately in other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax. Investment securities held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost. The fair values for investment securities are determined by quoted market prices, if available (Level 1). For securities where quoted prices are not available, fair values are calculated based on market prices of similar securities (Level 2). For securities where quoted prices or market prices of similar securities are not available, fair values are calculated using discounted cash flows or model-based techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market (Level 3). Management evaluates investment securities for OTTI at least on a quarterly basis, and more frequently when economic or market conditions warrant such an evaluation. The assessment of whether other-than-temporary decline exists involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and is based on the information available to management at the determination date. The Company recorded no OTTI for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015. The fair value of investment securities is discussed in further detail in Note Fair Value of Other Real Estate Owned and Foreclosed Assets Assets acquired by the Bank through or in lieu of loan foreclosure are initially recorded at fair value based on an independent appraisal, less estimated selling costs, at the date of foreclosure, establishing a new cost basis. If fair value declines subsequent to foreclosure, the asset value is written down through expense. Costs relating to improvement of property are capitalized, whereas costs relating to holding of the property are expensed. Deferred Income Taxes After previously converting to a federally-chartered savings bank, the Bank became a taxable organization and, after the Bank's recent charter conversion, remains a taxable organization as a Florida state-chartered commercial bank. Income tax expense, or benefit, is the total of the current year income tax due, or refundable, and the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary difference between carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities, computed using enacted tax rates and operating loss carryovers. The Company's principal deferred tax assets result from the allowance for portfolio loan losses and operating loss carryovers. A valuation allowance, if needed, reduces deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized. The Internal Revenue Code and applicable regulations are subject to interpretation with respect to the determination of the tax basis of assets and liabilities for credit unions that convert charters and become a taxable organization. Since the Bank's transition to a taxable organization, the Company has recorded income tax expense based upon management's interpretation of the applicable tax regulations. Positions taken by the Company in preparing our federal and state tax returns are subject to the review of taxing authorities, and the review by taxing authorities of the positions taken by management could result in a material adjustment to the financial statements. All available evidence, both positive and negative, is considered when determining whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary to reduce the carrying amount to a balance that is considered more likely than not to be realized. The determination of the realizability of deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management's evaluation of such evidence. Under the rules of IRC � 382, a change in the ownership of the Company occurred during the first quarter of 2013. During the second quarter of 2013, the Company became aware of the change in ownership based on applicable filings made by stockholders with the SEC. In accordance with IRC � 382, the Company determined the gross amount of net operating loss carryover that it could utilize was limited to approximately $325,000 per year. The deferred tax asset is discussed in further detail in Deferred Income Taxes on page 66 and in Note 14. Income Taxes of the Notes contained in this Report. Comparison of Financial Condition at December 31, 2017 and 2016 General Total assets increased $75.8 million, or 8.4%, to $983.3 million at Deecmber 31, 2017, as compared to $907.5 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in assets was funded primarily by increases in non-maturing deposits of $65.2 million, an increase of $24.8 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and stockholders' equity of $3.7 million, as discussed below, partially offset by a decrease in time deposits of $17.8 million. Net portfolio loans increased $118.3 million, while cash and cash equivalents decreased $9.5 million, investment securities decreased $27.6 million and other loans decreased $2.4 million. Total deposits increased $47.4 million, or 7.5%, to $675.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $628.4 million at December 31, 2016. Noninterest-bearing demand accounts increased $4.2 million and savings and money market accounts increased $69.7 million, while interest-bearing demand accounts decreased by $8.7 million and time deposits decreased by $17.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Total borrowings increased by $24.8 million to $213.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $188.7 million at December 31, 2016, due to the aforementioned increase in FHLB advances during 2017, as the Company supplemented its core deposit growth in order to meet its loan funding demand. Stockholders' equity increased by $3.7 million to $90.7 million at December 31, 2017, from $87.0 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to net income of $3.2 million and other comprehensive income of $0.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017.

The Bank has increased contingent liquidity capacity and sources to meet potential funding requirements, including availability from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and other private institutional sources to fund the origination of loans, fund other interest-earning assets, and pay-off liabilities. Investment Securities Investment securities are comprised primarily of debt securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and mortgage-backed securities. The investment portfolio decreased $27.6 million to $37.7 million at December 31, 2017, from $65.3 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the maturity of $75.0 million of short-term U.S. Treasury Bills and the sale of $5.0 million of corporate debt during 2017, partially offset by the purchase of $57.0 million of short-term U.S. Treasury Bills during 2017. All of the $37.7 million and $65.3 million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, of investment securities were classified as available-for-sale. As of December 31, 2017, $25.8 million, or 68.5%, of the debt securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are institutions the U.S. government has affirmed its commitment to support. As of December 31, 2017, no investment securities were pledged as collateral for the FHLB advances or any other borrowings. As of December 31, 2017, $3.2 million of investment securities were pledged as collateral for public fund deposits.

General Description of Business The Company and the Bank have traditionally focused on attracting deposits and investing those funds primarily in loans, including commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences and home equity loans. Additionally, the Bank invests funds in multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans, and commercial and residential construction loans. The Bank also invests funds in investment securities, primarily those issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies or entities, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and other interest-earning assets, such as investment securities. To a lesser extent, revenue is generated from service charges, gains on the sale of loans and other income. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms, which generally include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and money market, and time deposit accounts with terms ranging from three months to five years. Deposits are primarily solicited in the Bank's market areas of the Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia to fund loan demand and other liquidity needs; however, the Bank also solicits deposits in Central Florida. Recent Events Conversion to Florida State-chartered Commercial Bank On December 27, 2016, the Bank consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to that of a Florida state-chartered commercial bank supervised by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (the OFR) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). The conversion is not expected to affect the Bank's customers in any way. Bank depositors will continue to have the protection of Federal Deposit Insurance provided by the FDIC. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies are important to the presentation of the Company's financial condition, because they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, performance of the economy, financial condition of borrowers, and laws and regulations. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include: (i) determining the allowance for portfolio loan losses (the allowance) and the provision for portfolio loan losses (provision expense); (ii) measuring for impairment in troubled debt restructurings (TDR); (iii) determining the fair value of investment securities; There have been no material updates to these accounting policies or estimates affected by these accounting policies during the first six months of 2017. For additional discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the Critical Accounting Policies discussion in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2016 10-K. Comparison of Financial Condition at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 General Total assets increased $5.1 million, or 0.6%, to $912.6 million at June 30, 2017, as compared to $907.5 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in assets was funded primarily by increases in non-maturing deposits of $84.0 million, and stockholders' equity of $3.3 million, as discussed below, partially offset by a reduction of $56.3 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances and a decrease in time deposits of $24.6 million. Net portfolio loans increased $75.1 million, while cash and cash equivalents decreased $25.7 million, investment securities decreased $24.5 million and other loans decreased $13.8 million. Total deposits increased $59.4 million, or 9.5%, to $687.8 million at June 30, 2017, from $628.4 million at December 31, 2016. Noninterest-bearing demand accounts increased $11.0 million, interest-bearing demand accounts increased by $16.1 million, savings and money market accounts increased $56.9 million, and time deposits decreased by $24.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Total borrowings decreased by $56.3 million to $132.4 million at June 30, 2017, from $188.7 million at December 31, 2016, due to the aforementioned decrease in FHLB advances during the first half of 2017, as the Company continues to focus on core deposit growth. Stockholders' equity increased by $3.3 million to $90.3 million at June 30, 2017, from $87.0 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to net income of $2.7 million and other comprehensive income of $0.6 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. Following are the summarized comparative balance sheets as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016:  June 30, December 31, Increase / (Decrease) 2017 2016 Amount % (Dollars in Thousands) Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 34,186 $ 59,893 $ (25,707 ) (42.9 )% Investment securities 40,759 65,293 (24,534 ) (37.6 )% Portfolio loans 722,590 647,407 75,183 11.6 % Allowance for portfolio loan losses 8,220 8,162 58 0.7 % Portfolio loans, net 714,370 639,245 75,125 11.8 % Other loans (held-for-sale and warehouse loans held-for-investment) 73,877 87,724 (13,847 ) (15.8 )% Other assets 49,391 55,304 (5,913 ) (10.7 )% Total assets $ 912,583 $ 907,459 $ 5,124 0.6 % Liabilities and stockholders' equity: Deposits: Noninterest-bearing demand $ 70,673 $ 59,696 $ 10,977 18.4 % Interest-bearing demand 122,107 106,004 16,103 15.2 % Savings and money market 281,961 224,987 56,974 25.3 % Time 213,058 237,726 (24,668 ) (10.4 )% Total deposits 687,799 628,413 59,386 9.5 % Federal Home Loan Bank advances 132,425 188,758 (56,333 ) (29.8 )% Accrued expenses and other liabilities 2,076 3,270 (1,194 ) (36.5 )% Total liabilities 822,300 820,441 1,859 0.2 % Total stockholders' equity 90,283 87,018 3,265 3.8 % Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 912,583 $ 907,459 $ 5,124 0.6 %  Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased $25.7 million to $34.2 million at June 30, 2017 from $59.9 million at December 31, 2016. The Bank has increased contingent liquidity capacity and sources to meet potential funding requirements, including availability from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and other private institutional sources to fund the origination of loans, fund other interest-earning assets, and pay-off liabilities. Investment Securities Investment securities are comprised primarily of debt securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and mortgage-backed securities. The investment portfolio decreased $24.5 million to $40.8 million at June 30, 2017, from $65.3 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the maturity of $75.0 million of short-term U.S. Treasury Bills and the sale of $5.0 million of corporate debt during the first half of 2017, partially offset by the purchase of $57.0 million of short-term U.S. Treasury Bills during the first half of 2017. All of the $40.8 million and $65.3 million as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, of investment securities were classified as available-for-sale. As of June 30, 2017, $28.6 million, or 70.3%, of the debt securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are institutions the U.S. government has affirmed its commitment to support. As of June 30, 2017, no investment securities were pledged as collateral for the FHLB advances or any other borrowings. Portfolio Loans Below is a comparative composition of net portfolio loans as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, excluding loans held-for-sale and warehouse lines of credit secured by one- to four-family residential loans originated by third party originators under purchase and assumption agreements (warehouse loans held-for-investment):  June 30, % of Total December 31, % of Total 2017 Portfolio Loans 2016 Portfolio Loans (Dollars in Thousands) Real estate loans: One- to four-family $ 285,220 39.9 % $ 276,193 43.1 % Multi-family 73,166 10.2 % 70,452 11.0 % Commercial 184,192 25.7 % 104,143 16.3 % Land 16,733 2.3 % 17,218 2.7 % Total real estate loans 559,311 78.1 % 468,006 73.1 % Real estate construction loans: One- to four-family 15,206 2.1 % 22,687 3.5 % Commercial 13,788 2.0 % 14,432 2.3 % Acquisition and development - - % - - % Total real estate construction loans 28,994 4.1 % 37,119 5.8 % Other portfolio loans: Home equity 36,280 5.0 % 37,748 5.9 % Consumer 37,074 5.2 % 39,232 6.1 % Commercial 54,207 7.6 % 57,947 9.1 % Total other portfolio loans 127,561 17.8 % 134,927 21.1 % Total portfolio loans 715,866 100.0 % 640,052 100.0 % Allowance for portfolio loan losses (8,220 ) (8,162 ) Net deferred portfolio loan costs 5,606 5,685 Premiums and discounts on purchased loans, net 1,118 1,670 Portfolio loans, net $ 714,370 $ 639,245  Total portfolio loans increased $75.8 million, or 11.8%, to $715.9 million at June 30, 2017, as compared to $640.1 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to originations of $71.9 million of commercial real estate loans and $10.7 million of multi-family loans, as well as the purchase of $18.3 million of portfolio loans, partially offset by principal amortization and increased prepayments of one- to four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans during the six months ended June 30, 2017. The increase in prepayments on one- to four-family residential mortgages is consistent with the current low interest rate environment. Total portfolio loan growth was also partially offset by gross loan charge-offs of $0.5 million during the first half of 2017; however, the Company did not have any transfers to OREO of nonperforming loans during the first half of 2017. All portfolio loans originated to small businesses, including Small Business Administration (SBA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loans originated internally and held-for-sale (SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale), are included in the commercial category of either the Company's real estate loans, real estate construction loans or other portfolio loans. The Company sells the guaranteed portion of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale upon completion of loan funding and approval by the SBA or USDA, as applicable. The unguaranteed portion of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale, which remains in the commercial category of the Company's real estate construction loans or other portfolio loans, was $17.0 million and $10.7 million at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Company plans to expand the SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale business line going forward. Growth in mortgage origination, the SBA/USDA portfolio and other commercial business loan production is expected to exceed principal amortization and loan pay-offs in the near future, but we can give no assurances regarding such growth. The composition of the Bank's portfolio loans is weighted toward one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. As of June 30, 2017, first mortgages (including residential construction loans) and home equity loans totaled $336.7 million, or 47.0% of total portfolio loans. Approximately $22.3 million, or 61.5%, of loans recorded as home equity loans and $322.8 million, or 95.9%, of loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential properties were in a first lien position as of June 30, 2017. The composition of first mortgages and home equity loans by state as of June 30, 2017 was as follows:  Other Florida Georgia States Total (Dollars in Thousands) One- to four-family residential mortgages $ 214,675 $ 46,371 $ 24,174 $ 285,220 Home equity and lines of credit 19,467 15,914 899 36,280 One- to four-family construction loans 14,804 402 - 15,206 $ 248,946 $ 62,687 $ 25,073 $ 336,706  Allowance for Portfolio Loan Losses The allowance was $8.2 million, or 1.1% of total portfolio loans, at June 30, 2017, compared to $8.2 million, or 1.3% of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2016. The activity in the allowance for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:  June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016 (Dollars in Thousands) Balance at beginning of year $ 8,162 $ 7,745 Charge-offs: Real estate loans: One- to four-family (58 ) (127 ) Multi-family - - Commercial - - Land - - Real estate construction loans: One- to four-family - - Commercial - - Acquisition and development - - Other portfolio loans: Home equity (116 ) (136 ) Consumer (226 ) (337 ) Commercial (119 ) - Total charge-offs (519 ) (600 ) Recoveries: Real estate loans: One- to four-family 117 353 Multi-family - - Commercial - - Land 3 22 Real estate construction loans: One- to four-family - - Commercial - - Acquisition and development - - Other portfolio loans: Home equity 11 11 Consumer 149 150 Commercial 6 - Total recoveries 286 536 Net charge-offs (233 ) (64 ) Provision for portfolio loan losses 291 349 Balance at end of period $ 8,220 $ 8,030 Net charge-offs to average outstanding portfolio loans 0.07 % 0.02 %  The increase in net charge-offs during the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016, were primarily the result of decreased recoveries related to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans, as well as the charge-off of one commercial loan. Below is a comparative composition of nonperforming assets as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016:  June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 (Dollars in Thousands) Nonperforming assets: Real estate loans: One- to four-family $ 988 $ 1,533 Multi-family - - Commercial 2,239 2,276 Land 5,510 5,548 Real estate construction loans: One- to four-family - - Commercial - - Acquisition and development - - Other portfolio loans: Home equity 318 58 Consumer 138 237 Commercial 637 502 Total nonperforming loans 9,830 10,154 Other real estate owned 242 2,886 Total nonperforming assets $ 10,072 $ 13,040 Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.4 % 1.6 % Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.1 % 1.4 %  Nonperforming loans were $9.8 million, or 1.4% of total portfolio loans, at June 30, 2017, as compared to $10.1 million, or 1.6% of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2016. The decrease in nonperforming loans was primarily due to nonperforming one- to four-family residential mortgages being reclassified to performing, as well as principal reductions and loan pay-offs of other existing nonperforming loans, partially offset by certain home equity loans and small business loans (included in commercial other portfolio loans) being classified as nonperforming. During the past few years, and continuing into the first half of 2017, the market for disposing of nonperforming assets has become more active. These types of transactions may result in additional losses over the amounts provided for in the allowance; however, the Company continues to monitor and attempt to reduce nonperforming assets through the least costly means possible. The allowance is determined by the information available at the time such determination is made and reflects management's estimate of loss. As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all nonperforming loans were classified as nonaccrual and there were no loans 90 days past due and accruing interest. OREO was $0.2 million at June 30, 2017, down $2.7 million from $2.9 million at December 31, 2016, as the Company disposed of a $2.6 million foreclosed property, which resulted in a $0.2 million loss, and had writedowns of OREO of $0.1 million. Impaired Loans The following table shows impaired loans segregated by performing and nonperforming status and the associated allowance as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016: June 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Balance Allowance Balance Allowance (Dollars in Thousands) . . .

General Description of Business The Company and the Bank have traditionally focused on attracting deposits and investing those funds primarily in loans, including commercial real estate loans, consumer loans, first mortgages on owner-occupied, one- to four-family residences and home equity loans. Additionally, the Bank invests funds in multi-family residential loans, commercial business loans, and commercial and residential construction loans. The Bank also invests funds in investment securities, primarily those issued by U.S. government-sponsored agencies or entities, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae. Revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and other interest-earning assets, such as investment securities. To a lesser extent, revenue is generated from service charges, gains on the sale of loans and other income. The Bank offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms, which generally include noninterest-bearing and interest-bearing demand, savings and money market, and time deposit accounts with terms ranging from three months to five years. Deposits are primarily solicited in the Bank's market areas of the Northeast Florida and Southeast Georgia to fund loan demand and other liquidity needs; however, the Bank also solicits deposits in Central Florida. Recent Events Conversion to Florida State-chartered Commercial Bank On December 27, 2016, the Bank consummated the conversion of its charter from that of a federally-chartered savings bank to that of a Florida state-chartered commercial bank supervised by the Florida Office of Financial Regulation (the OFR) and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (the FDIC). The conversion is not expected to affect the Bank's customers in any way. Bank depositors will continue to have the protection of Federal Deposit Insurance provided by the FDIC. Critical Accounting Policies Certain accounting policies are important to the presentation of the Company's financial condition, because they require management to make difficult, complex or subjective judgments, some of which may relate to matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates associated with these policies are susceptible to material changes as a result of changes in facts and circumstances, including, without limitation, changes in interest rates, performance of the economy, financial condition of borrowers, and laws and regulations. Management believes that its critical accounting policies include: (i) determining the allowance for portfolio loan losses (the allowance) and the provision for portfolio loan losses (provision expense); (ii) measuring for impairment in troubled debt restructurings (TDR); (iii) determining the fair value of investment securities; There have been no material updates to these accounting policies or estimates affected by these accounting policies during the first three months of 2017. For additional discussion of our critical accounting policies and estimates, see the Critical Accounting Policies discussion in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in the 2016 10-K. Comparison of Financial Condition at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 General Total assets increased $16.0 million, or 1.8%, to $923.5 million at March 31, 2017, as compared to $907.5 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in assets was funded primarily by increases in non-maturing deposits of $53.8 million, time deposits of $3.6 million, and stockholders' equity of $1.9 million, as discussed below, partially offset by a reduction of $44.6 million in Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) advances. Net portfolio loans increased $42.3 million and investment securities increased $35.8 million, while cash and cash equivalents decreased $32.1 million and other loans decreased $27.5 million. Total deposits increased $57.4 million, or 9.1%, to $685.8 million at March 31, 2017, from $628.4 million at December 31, 2016. Noninterest-bearing demand accounts increased $8.2 million, interest-bearing demand accounts increased by $21.3 million, savings and money market accounts increased $24.3 million, and time deposits increased by $3.6 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Total borrowings decreased by $44.6 million to $144.1 million at March 31, 2017, from $188.7 million at December 31, 2016, due to the aforementioned decrease in FHLB advances during the first quarter of 2017, as the Company continues to focus on core deposit growth. Stockholders' equity increased by $1.9 million to $88.9 million at March 31, 2017, from $87.0 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to net income of $1.5 million and other comprehensive income of $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Following are the summarized comparative balance sheets as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:  March 31, December 31, Increase / (Decrease) 2017 2016 Amount % (Dollars in Thousands) Assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 27,754 $ 59,893 $ (32,139 ) (53.7 )% Investment securities 101,069 65,293 35,776 54.8 % Portfolio loans 689,848 647,407 42,441 6.6 % Allowance for portfolio loan losses 8,272 8,162 110 1.3 % Portfolio loans, net 681,576 639,245 42,331 6.6 % Other loans (held-for-sale and warehouse loans held-for-investment) 60,244 87,724 (27,480 ) (31.3 )% Other assets 52,844 55,304 (2,460 ) (4.4 )% Total assets $ 923,487 $ 907,459 $ 16,028 1.8 % Liabilities and stockholders' equity: Deposits: Noninterest-bearing demand $ 67,926 $ 59,696 $ 8,230 13.8 % Interest-bearing demand 127,297 106,004 21,293 20.1 % Savings and money market 249,279 224,987 24,292 10.8 % Time 241,336 237,726 3,610 1.5 % Total deposits 685,838 628,413 57,425 9.1 % Federal Home Loan Bank advances 144,092 188,758 (44,666 ) (23.7 )% Accrued expenses and other liabilities 4,692 3,270 1,422 43.5 % Total liabilities 834,622 820,441 14,181 1.7 % Total stockholders' equity 88,865 87,018 1,847 2.1 % Total liabilities and stockholders' equity $ 923,487 $ 907,459 $ 16,028 1.8 %  Cash and Cash Equivalents Cash and cash equivalents decreased $32.1 million to $27.8 million at March 31, 2017 from $59.9 million at December 31, 2016. The Bank has increased contingent liquidity capacity and sources to meet potential funding requirements, including availability from the FHLB, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta and other private institutional sources to fund the origination of loans, fund other interest-earning assets, and pay-off liabilities. Investment Securities Investment securities are comprised primarily of debt securities of U.S. government-sponsored enterprises and mortgage-backed securities. The investment portfolio increased $35.8 million to $101.1 million at March 31, 2017, from $65.3 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the purchase of $55.0 million of short-term U.S. Treasury Bills during the first quarter of 2017, partially offset by the maturity of $20.0 million of short-term U.S. Treasury Bills that where purchased in 2016. All of the $101.1 million and $65.3 million as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, of investment securities were classified as available-for-sale. As of March 31, 2017, $84.5 million, or 83.6%, of the debt securities held by the Company were issued by U.S. government-sponsored entities and agencies, primarily Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are institutions the U.S. government has affirmed its commitment to support. As of March 31, 2017, no investment securities were pledged as collateral for the FHLB advances or any other borrowings. Portfolio Loans Below is a comparative composition of net portfolio loans as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, excluding loans held-for-sale and warehouse lines of credit secured by one- to four-family residential loans originated by third party originators under purchase and assumption agreements (warehouse loans held-for-investment):  March 31, % of Total December 31, % of Total 2017 Portfolio Loans 2016 Portfolio Loans (Dollars in Thousands) Real estate loans: One- to four-family $ 290,609 42.6 % $ 276,193 43.1 % Multi-family 77,512 11.4 % 70,452 11.0 % Commercial 132,598 19.4 % 104,143 16.3 % Land 17,561 2.6 % 17,218 2.7 % Total real estate loans 518,280 5.9 % 468,006 73.1 % Real estate construction loans: One- to four-family 22,859 3.3 % 22,687 3.5 % Commercial 10,215 1.5 % 14,432 2.3 % Acquisition and development - - % - - % Total real estate construction loans 33,074 4.8 % 37,119 5.8 % Other portfolio loans: Home equity 37,317 5.5 % 37,748 5.9 % Consumer 38,196 5.6 % 39,232 6.1 % Commercial 55,562 8.1 % 57,947 9.1 % Total other portfolio loans 131,075 19.2 % 134,927 21.1 % Total portfolio loans 682,429 100.0 % 640,052 100.0 % Allowance for portfolio loan losses (8,272 ) (8,162 ) Net deferred portfolio loan costs 5,687 5,685 Premiums and discounts on purchased loans, net 1,732 1,670 Portfolio loans, net $ 681,576 $ 639,245  Total portfolio loans increased $42.3 million, or 6.6%, to $682.4 million at March 31, 2017, as compared to $640.1 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to originations of $31.2 million of commercial real estate loans and $7.5 million of multi-family loans, as well as the purchase of $15.9 million of one- to four-family residential mortgages, partially offset by principal amortization and increased prepayments of one- to four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans during the three months ended March 31, 2017. The increase in prepayments on one- to four-family residential mortgages is consistent with the current low interest rate environment. Total portfolio loans growth was also partially offset by gross loan charge-offs of $0.1 million during the first quarter of 2017; however, the Company did not have any transfers to OREO of nonperforming loans during the first quarter of 2017. All portfolio loans originated to small businesses, including Small Business Administration (SBA) and U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loans originated internally and held-for-sale (SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale), are included in the commercial category of either the Company's real estate loans, real estate construction loans or other portfolio loans. The Company sells the guaranteed portion of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale upon completion of loan funding and approval by the SBA or USDA, as applicable. The unguaranteed portion of SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale, which remains in the commercial category of the Company's real estate construction loans or other portfolio loans, was $17.4 million and $10.7 million at March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. The Company plans to expand the SBA/USDA loans held-for-sale business line going forward. Growth in mortgage origination, the SBA/USDA portfolio and other commercial business loan production is expected to exceed principal amortization and loan pay-offs in the near future, but we can give no assurances regarding such growth. The composition of the Bank's portfolio loans is weighted toward one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. As of March 31, 2017, first mortgages (including residential construction loans) and home equity loans totaled $350.8 million, or 51.4% of total portfolio loans. Approximately $22.4 million, or 60.1%, of loans recorded as home equity loans and $335.9 million, or 95.8%, of loans collateralized by one- to four-family residential properties were in a first lien position as of March 31, 2017. The composition of first mortgages and home equity loans by state as of March 31, 2017 was as follows:  Other Florida Georgia States Total (Dollars in Thousands) One- to four-family residential mortgages $ 217,983 $ 48,409 $ 24,217 $ 290,609 Home equity and lines of credit 20,161 16,464 692 37,317 One- to four-family construction loans 21,919 940 - 22,859 $ 260,063 $ 65,813 $ 24,909 $ 350,785  Allowance for Portfolio Loan Losses The allowance was $8.3 million, or 1.2% of total portfolio loans, at March 31, 2017, compared to $8.2 million, or 1.3% of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2016. The activity in the allowance for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 was as follows:  March 31, 2017 March 31, 2016 (Dollars in Thousands) Balance at beginning of year $ 8,162 $ 7,745 Charge-offs: Real estate loans: One- to four-family (35 ) (12 ) Multi-family - - Commercial - - Land - - Real estate construction loans: One- to four-family - - Commercial - - Acquisition and development - - Other portfolio loans: Home equity - (24 ) Consumer (77 ) (204 ) Commercial - - Total charge-offs (112 ) (240 ) Recoveries: Real estate loans: One- to four-family 56 8 Multi-family - - Commercial - - Land - 11 Real estate construction loans: One- to four-family - - Commercial - - Acquisition and development - - Other portfolio loans: Home equity 5 5 Consumer 61 95 Commercial - - Total recoveries 122 119 Net recoveries (charge-offs) 10 (121 ) Provision for portfolio loan losses 100 150 Balance at end of period $ 8,272 $ 7,774 Net recoveries (charge-offs) to average outstanding portfolio loans - % 0.08 %  Net recoveries during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to net charge-offs in the same period in 2016, were primarily the result of a $45,000 decrease in net charge-offs in consumer auto loans, a $47,000 decrease in net charge-offs in unsecured consumer loans, and a $48,000 increase in gross recoveries in one- to four-family residential and home equity loans. Below is a comparative composition of nonperforming assets as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016:  March 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (Dollars in Thousands) Nonperforming assets: Real estate loans: One- to four-family $ 797 $ 1,533 Multi-family - - Commercial 2,259 2,276 Land 5,510 5,548 Real estate construction loans: One- to four-family - - Commercial - - Acquisition and development - - Other portfolio loans: Home equity 242 58 Consumer 205 237 Commercial 757 502 Total nonperforming loans 9,770 10,154 Other real estate owned 2,806 2,886 Total nonperforming assets $ 12,576 $ 13,040 Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.4 % 1.6 % Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.4 % 1.4 %  Nonperforming loans were $9.8 million, or 1.4% of total portfolio loans, at March 31, 2017, as compared to $10.1 million, or 1.6% of total portfolio loans, at December 31, 2016. The decrease in nonperforming loans was primarily due to nonperforming one- to four-family residential mortgages being reclassified to performing, as well as principal reductions and loan pay-offs of other existing nonperforming loans, partially offset by certain home equity loans and small business loans (included in commercial other portfolio loans) being classified as nonperforming. During the past few years, and continuing into the first three months of 2017, the market for disposing of nonperforming assets has become more active. These types of transactions may result in additional losses over the amounts provided for in the allowance; however, the Company continues to monitor and attempt to reduce nonperforming assets through the least costly means possible. The allowance is determined by the information available at the time such determination is made and reflects management's estimate of loss. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, all nonperforming loans were classified as nonaccrual and there were no loans 90 days past due and accruing interest. OREO was $2.8 million at March 31, 2017, down $0.1 million from $2.9 million at December 31, 2016, as the Company had writedowns of OREO of $0.1 million. The OREO balances at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 included a commercial real estate property, representing the majority of each balance. As of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the carrying value of such commercial real estate property was $2.4 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The Company recorded writedowns on foreclosed assets of $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, while the Company did not record any losses on foreclosed assets for the three months ended March 31, 2016.

ACFC,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jan 23, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (Atlantic Coast or the Company, NASDAQ: ACFC): Portfolio loans increased $118 million since December 2016. Deposits increased $47 million during the last 12 months. Nonperforming assets declined 27% to $9.5 million year over year. Entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Ameris Bancorp on November 16, 2017. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (Atlantic Coast or the Company, NASDAQ: ACFC), the holding company for Atlantic Coast Bank (the Bank), today reported a loss per diluted share of $0.04 and earnings per diluted share of $0.21 for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with earnings of $0.13 and $0.42 for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. The results for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, included a charge of $1.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, related to a reduction in the valuation of the Company's net deferred tax assets caused by the recently enacted tax legislation, which reduces the future statutory corporate income tax rate, and $0.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, of merger-related costs. Commenting on the Company's results, John K. Stephens, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Aside from the impact of the new tax legislation on our deferred tax assets, which was anticipated as Congress began to consider reduced corporate income tax rates last fall, the fourth quarter demonstrated continued strength throughout our franchise. During the past year, total loans increased 16% while deposits increased 8%, with both reflecting the success of our strategies to increase our presence and visibility across our markets. Meanwhile, credit quality continued to improve, as indicated by an ongoing decline in nonperforming assets – both in total and relative to total assets. With this progress, we proudly look back on the Company's performance and accomplishments in 2017."" Separately, Stephens noted the Company's recent announcement to be acquired by Ameris Bancorp in a transaction that is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2018, subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals, along with other customary conditions. ""We are excited about the prospects of joining forces with Ameris and together becoming the largest community bank in the Jacksonville market. We believe there is a good cultural fit between our two banks, which means that our customers will continue to see a strong commitment to high-touch service while benefiting directly from the additional resources and capabilities offered by Ameris."" Other significant highlights of the fourth quarter of 2017 and the full year included: Net interest income was $7.2 million and $27.0 million for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with $7.1 million and $26.5 million for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Net interest margin was 3.24% and 3.20% for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared with 3.30% and 3.12% for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2016, respectively. Total loans (including portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment) increased 16% to $842.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $727.0 million at December 31, 2016. The Company's loan growth since December 31, 2016, was driven primarily by increased commercial real estate lending in all of its markets. This growth was supplemented by strategic loan purchases, somewhat offset by mortgage loan sales as part of the Company's interest rate risk and balance sheet management strategies and decreases in warehouse loans held-for-investment. Deposits increased 8% to $675.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $628.4 million at December 31, 2016. Deposits, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, increased 15% to $639.8 million at December 31, 2017, from $558.0 million at December 31, 2016. Wholesale funding, which includes brokered certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, decreased 4% to $249.5 million at December 31, 2017, from $259.2 million at December 31, 2016. The increase in non-brokered deposits and resulting reduced reliance on wholesale funding was driven primarily by the Company's commercial deposit strategies put in place during 2016. Total assets increased to $983.3 million at December 31, 2017, from $907.5 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in portfolio loans and warehouse loans held-for-investment, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and loans held-for-sale. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, declined to 0.97% at December 31, 2017, from 1.44% at December 31, 2016. Due to the Company's generally stable credit quality during 2016 and continuing throughout 2017, reflecting an overall slowing pace of loan reclassifications to nonperforming, the Company’s loan loss provision remained at a low level for both the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, while maintaining, in management's view, a stable ratio of allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans. The Bank's ratios of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 (core) capital to adjusted total assets were 12.51% and 9.66%, respectively, at December 31, 2017, and each continued to exceed the levels required by regulation, currently 10% and 5%, respectively, for a bank to be considered well-capitalized. Tracy L. Keegan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, ""It was gratifying to see net interest margin increase 8 basis points during 2017, reflecting the success of the operating strategies we implemented this past year to grow loans and noninterest-bearing deposits, resulting in a more diversified balance sheet."" Commenting on the revaluation adjustment made on the Company's net deferred tax assets, Keegan said ""The charge of $1.6 million was recorded as an increase in income tax expense for the fourth quarter of 2017. Deferred tax assets and liabilities occur due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of the Company's assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. With the new tax legislation passed in December 2017, the Company's net deferred tax assets are now expected to be settled at a statutory rate of 21% rather than the statutory rate of 35% used previously to value these deferred tax assets."" Keegan also noted that the Company incurred merger-related costs of approximately $0.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Bank Regulatory Capital   At Key Capital Measures Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 Total risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 12.51 % 14.83 % Common equity tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.42 % 13.58 % Tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.42 % 13.58 % Tier 1 (core) capital ratio (to adjusted total assets) 9.66 % 9.44 % The decrease in risk-weighted capital ratios at December 31, 2017, compared with December 31, 2016, reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets due to growth in portfolio loans and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, as well as an increase in the risk weighting of certain portfolio loan categories, partially offset by an increase in equity due to accumulated earnings. The charge to remeasure net deferred tax assets, together with merger related expenses, reduced the Company's Tier 1 (core) capital ratio as of December 31, 2017, by approximately 20 basis points.   Credit Quality At Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Nonperforming loans $ 7.8 $ 10.1 Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.02 % 1.57 % Other real estate owned $ 1.7 $ 2.9 Nonperforming assets $ 9.5 $ 13.0 Nonperforming assets to total assets 0.97 % 1.44 % Troubled debt restructurings performing for less than 12 months under terms of modification [ (1)] $ 15.2 $ 14.6 Troubled debt restructurings performing for more than 12 months under terms of modification $ 15.7 $ 20.3   _________________________ (1) Includes $5.9 million and $7.9 million of nonperforming loans at December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Nonperforming assets have declined for five consecutive quarters as the Company's overall credit quality remained stable and the general pace of loans reclassified to nonperforming remained slow during the last 12 months. Importantly, OREO declined significantly as of December 31, 2017, compared with that at December 31, 2016, primarily due to the sale of a $2.4 million foreclosed property in the second quarter of 2017, partially offset by the foreclosure of a $1.6 million property in the fourth quarter of 2017, which was expected to occur and had been fully reserved for prior to the foreclosure.     Provision / Allowance for Loan Losses At and for the Three Months Ended   At and for the Year Ended   Dec. 31, 2017   Sept. 30, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Provision for portfolio loan losses $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.7 $ 0.6 Allowance for portfolio loan losses $ 8.6 $ 8.4 $ 8.2 $ 8.6 $ 8.2 Allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans 1.12% 1.12% 1.26% 1.12% 1.26% Allowance for portfolio loan losses to nonperforming loans 110.43% 88.16% 80.38% 110.43% 80.38% Net charge-offs (recoveries) $ 0.0 $ (0.0) $ 0.0 $ 0.3 $ 0.2 Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average outstanding portfolio loans (annualized) 0.02% (0.01)% 0.02% 0.04% 0.03%   Net charge-offs totaled $39,000 and $38,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, while net recoveries totaled $18,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017. This reflects a trend of solid economic conditions across the Company's markets, which has led to continued low levels of net charge-offs during the last 12 months. The Company's provision for portfolio loan losses has remained within a relatively narrow range over the past year. However, it was up $185,000 for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with the fourth quarter last year, and was up $74,000 for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, versus full year 2016. The increase in the allowance for portfolio loan losses at December 31, 2017, compared with that at December 31, 2016, was attributable primarily to loan growth, which reflected organic growth supplemented by strategic loan purchases that were offset partially by loan sales, principal amortization, and increased prepayments of one- to four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans. Management believes the allowance for portfolio loan losses at December 31, 2017, is sufficient to absorb losses in portfolio loans as of the end of the period. Net Interest Income   Three Months Ended   Year Ended Dec. 31, 2017   Sept. 30, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Net interest income $ 7.2 $ 6.8 $ 7.1 $ 27.0 $ 26.5 Net interest margin 3.24 % 3.18 % 3.30 % 3.20 % 3.12 % Yield on investment securities 2.09 % 2.05 % 2.29 % 2.25 % 2.11 % Yield on loans 4.47 % 4.31 % 4.40 % 4.33 % 4.37 % Total cost of funds 1.03 % 0.98 % 0.78 % 0.93 % 0.92 % Average cost of deposits 0.85 % 0.80 % 0.66 % 0.77 % 0.62 % Rates paid on borrowed funds 1.83 % 2.02 % 1.14 % 1.88 % 1.70 % The slight decrease in net interest margin during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2016, reflected an increase in rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds, with little to no change in rates on new loans due to highly competitive lending conditions. In addition, margin remains relatively stable given the improved mix in core deposits and growth in noninterest-bearing accounts. The increase in net interest margin during the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected a decrease in rates paid on funds due to an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, and an increase in higher-margin interest-earning assets outstanding, reflecting the Company's ongoing redeployment of excess liquidity to grow its portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment. Noninterest Income / Noninterest Expense / Income Tax Expense   Three Months Ended   Year Ended Dec. 31, 2017   Sept. 30, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 Dec. 31, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Noninterest income $ 1.3 $ 1.2 $ 1.9 $ 7.0 $ 9.2 Noninterest expense $ 6.4 $ 6.1 $ 6.0 $ 25.6 $ 25.1 Income tax expense $ 2.5 $ 0.6 $ 1.0 $ 4.6 $ 3.6 The decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans and loans held-for-sale, as well as reduced service charges and fees. The decrease in noninterest income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of investment securities, lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans, reduced service charges and fees, and a decrease in miscellaneous operating income related to an escrow account that was forfeited in 2016 in connection with an OREO sale, partially offset by higher gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale. The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected an increase in compensation and benefits, occupancy and equipment expense, and merger-related costs associated with the proposed merger with Ameris Bancorp, partially offset by reduced foreclosed asset expense and a decrease in data processing expenses. The increase in noninterest expense during the 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the 12 months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected an increase in compensation and benefits, increased data processing expenses associated with efforts to improve the Company's IT infrastructure, an increase in occupancy and equipment expense, and the aforementioned merger-related costs, partially offset by the positive impact of an adjustment to the rate of accrual for FDIC insurance premiums, reducing the amount accrued for the full year, and a decrease in collection expense. The increase in income tax expense for the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2017, compared with that of the 3 and 12 months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected the impact of newly enacted tax legislation, partially offset by a decline in income before income tax expense. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Core earnings and core earnings per diluted share exclude the effects of certain transactions that occurred during the period, as detailed in the following reconciliation of these measures.

Atlantic Coast's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Atlantic Coast's management also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures aid investors in analyzing the Company's business trends and in understanding the Company's performance. In addition, the Company may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes.

ACFC,"MILWAUKEE, Nov. 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ademi & O'Reilly, LLP is investigating the Board of Directors of Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation ACFC, +0.78% for possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of Maryland law in connection with the sale of Atlantic Coast to Ameris. Click here to learn how to join the action: http://ademilaw.com/case/atlantic-coast or call Guri Ademi toll-free at 866-264-3995. There is no cost or obligation to you. Ademi & O'Reilly, LLP alleges Atlantic Coast's long-term financial outlook is improving and yet Atlantic Coast shareholders will receive the equivalent of $9.32 per Atlantic Coast common share or approximately $145 million in the aggregate.  Ameris is well aware of Atlantic Coast's improving financial metrics and is purchasing Atlantic Coast at a substantial discount. The merger agreement unreasonably limits competing bids for Atlantic Coast by (i) prohibiting solicitation of any further bids, and (ii) imposing a termination penalty should Atlantic Coast receive and accept a superior bid. Atlantic Coast insiders, their affiliates and other major shareholders own significant voting stock, and will receive millions of dollars as part of change of control arrangements, and therefore can unduly influence a sale of Atlantic Coast. Our investigation centers on the conduct of Atlantic Coast's Board of Directors, who have unanimously approved the transaction, and whether they are (i) fulfilling their fiduciary duties to all shareholders, and (ii) obtaining a fair and reasonable price for Atlantic Coast given its current financial condition and prospects.

ACFC,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Oct 24, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation ACFC, +0.78% Portfolio loans increased almost $100 million since September 2016. Deposits increased nearly $59 million during the last 12 months. Credit quality remained strong as nonperforming loans declined 12% to $9.5 million year over year. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (Atlantic Coast or the Company) ACFC, +0.78% the holding company for Atlantic Coast Bank (the Bank), today reported earnings per diluted share of $0.07 and $0.25 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared with earnings of $0.10 and $0.29 for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Commenting on the Company's results, John K. Stephens, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""I am pleased to report continued momentum in our business during the third quarter and ongoing progress in the implementation of strategies that are expected to enhance future operations. Earnings for the period, while remaining strong, were affected somewhat by unforeseen timing issues surrounding loan sale activity as a result of Hurricane Irma. We anticipate getting back on track with these transactions over the next few quarters. Additionally, I am pleased to note other key signs of the Company's solid performance, such as 9% loan growth over the trailing 12 months, matched by similar growth in deposits due primarily to strong expansion of our core deposit base. Importantly, these ongoing improvements have occurred against the backdrop of solid and stable credit quality metrics, as seen by an exceptionally low level of OREO at the end of the third quarter. As we now focus on the final quarter of the year and a successful conclusion to 2017, I believe we remain well positioned to pursue and capitalize on the growth opportunities before us and, in turn, continue to solidify our role as a leading community bank in our markets."" Other significant highlights of the third quarter and first nine months of 2017 included: Net interest income was $6.8 million and $19.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared with $6.9 million and $19.4 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Net interest margin was 3.18% and 3.19% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared with 3.19% and 3.08% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Total loans (including portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment) increased 9% to $790.5 million at September 30, 2017, from $727.0 million at December 31, 2016, and 2% from $774.3 million at September 30, 2016. The Company's loan growth since September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, was driven primarily by increased commercial real estate lending in all of its markets. This growth was somewhat offset by portfolio mortgage loan sales as part of the Company's interest rate risk and balance sheet management strategies and decreases in warehouse loans held-for-investment. Deposits increased 8% to $676.4 million at September 30, 2017, from $628.4 million at December 31, 2016, and 10% from $617.5 million at September 30, 2016. Deposits, excluding brokered certificates of deposit, increased 13% to $631.4 million at September 30, 2017, from $558.0 million at December 31, 2016, and 15% from $549.0 million at September 30, 2016. Wholesale funding, which includes brokered certificates of deposit and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, decreased 24% to $195.8 million at September 30, 2017, from $259.2 million at December 31, 2016, and 34% from $298.4 million at September 30, 2016. The increase in non-brokered deposits and resulting reduced reliance on wholesale funding was driven primarily by the Company's commercial deposit strategies put in place during 2016. Total assets increased to $921.9 million at September 30, 2017, from $907.5 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in portfolio loans, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and other loans (loans held-for-sale and warehouse loans held-for-investment). Total assets at the end of the third quarter of 2017 decreased from $936.9 million at September 30, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and other loans, which were partially offset by an increase in portfolio loans. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, declined to 1.05% at September 30, 2017, from 1.44% at December 31, 2016, and 1.46% at September 30, 2016. Because of the Company's generally stable credit quality throughout 2016 and continuing through the first nine months of 2017, reflecting an overall slowing pace of loan reclassifications to nonperforming, the Company was able to reduce its loan loss provision for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared with the same periods in 2016, while maintaining, in management's view, an adequate ratio of allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans. The Bank's ratios of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 (core) capital to adjusted total assets were 12.99% and 10.03%, respectively, at September 30, 2017, and each continued to exceed the levels required by regulation, currently 10% and 5%, respectively, for a bank to be considered well-capitalized. Tracy L. Keegan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, ""We were pleased to see net interest margin improve 11 basis points year to date versus the same period in 2016, although we did experience some margin pressure in the third quarter. This compression primarily reflected higher rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds within the context of competitive conditions that have restrained loan yields. Overall, the changes we have implemented in our funding strategies, together with steps taken to improve asset quality, have resulted in a stronger and more diversified balance sheet, one that appropriately supports the Company for continued growth and additional operational improvement."" Bank Regulatory Capital       At Key Capital Measures Sept. 30, 2017     Dec. 31, 2016     Sept. 30, 2016 Total risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 12.99 % 14.83 % 13.42 % Common equity tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.87 % 13.58 % 12.21 % Tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.87 % 13.58 % 12.21 % Tier 1 (core) capital ratio (to adjusted total assets) 10.03 % 9.44 % 9.09 %   The decrease in risk-weighted capital ratios at September 30, 2017, compared with September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets, due to growth in portfolio loans and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, as well as an increase in the risk weighting of certain portfolio loan categories, partially offset by an increase in equity due to accumulated earnings. Credit Quality     At Sept. 30, 2017   Dec. 31, 2016   Sept. 30, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Nonperforming loans $ 9.5 $ 10.1 $ 10.9 Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.27 % 1.57 % 1.66 % Other real estate owned $ 0.2 $ 2.9 $ 2.8 Nonperforming assets $ 9.7 $ 13.0 $ 13.7 Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.05 % 1.44 % 1.46 % Troubled debt restructurings performing for less than 12 months under terms of modification [ (1)] $ 17.1 $ 14.6 $ 14.8 Troubled debt restructurings performing for more than 12 months under terms of modification $ 15.9 $ 20.3 $ 20.2   _________________________ (1) Includes $7.5 million, $7.9 million, and $8.2 million of nonperforming loans at September 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and September 30, 2016, respectively.   While nonperforming assets have declined for four consecutive quarters, the current level reflects the reclassification of two specific loans to nonperforming status during the third quarter of 2016. That aside, the Company's overall credit quality remains stable as the general pace of loans reclassified to nonperforming remained slow during the last 12 months. Importantly, OREO declined significantly as of September 30, 2017, compared with that at September 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, primarily due to the sale of a $2.4 million foreclosed property in the second quarter of 2017. Provision / Allowance for Loan Losses       At and for the Three Months Ended     At and for the Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, 2017     June 30, 2017     Sept. 30, 2016 Sept. 30, 2017     Sept. 30, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Provision for portfolio loan losses $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 $ 0.5 $ 0.6 Allowance for portfolio loan losses $ 8.4 $ 8.2 $ 8.2 $ 8.4 $ 8.2 Allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans 1.12 % 1.14 % 1.24 % 1.12 % 1.24 % Allowance for portfolio loan losses to nonperforming loans 88.16 % 83.61 % 74.92 % 88.16 % 74.92 % Net charge-offs (recoveries) $ (0.0 ) [(1)] $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.2 Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average outstanding portfolio loans (annualized) (0.01 )% 0.14 % 0.06 % 0.04 % 0.04 %   _________________________ (1) Net recoveries totaled $18,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017.   The Company's provision for portfolio loan losses has remained within a relatively narrow range over the past year. However, it was down 24% for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared with the third quarter last year, and was down 20% for the first nine months ended September 30, 2017, versus the first nine months of 2016. This reflects a trend of solid economic conditions across the Company's markets, which has led to continued low levels of net charge-offs during the last 12 months. The increase in the allowance for portfolio loan losses at September 30, 2017, compared with that at September 30, 2016, was attributable primarily to loan growth, which reflected organic growth supplemented by strategic loan purchases that were offset partially by loan sales, principal amortization, and increased prepayments of one- to four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans. Management believes the allowance for portfolio loan losses at September 30, 2017, is sufficient to absorb losses in portfolio loans as of the end of the period. Net Interest Income       Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, 2017     June 30, 2017     Sept. 30, 2016 Sept. 30, 2017     Sept. 30, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Net interest income $ 6.8 $ 6.7 $ 6.9 $ 19.8 $ 19.4 Net interest margin 3.18 % 3.19 % 3.19 % 3.19 % 3.08 % Yield on investment securities 2.05 % 2.35 % 2.12 % 2.29 % 2.07 % Yield on loans 4.31 % 4.25 % 4.24 % 4.27 % 4.36 % Total cost of funds 0.98 % 0.91 % 0.79 % 0.90 % 0.97 % Average cost of deposits 0.80 % 0.75 % 0.64 % 0.74 % 0.61 % Rates paid on borrowed funds 2.02 % 1.92 % 1.21 % 1.91 % 1.87 %   The slight decrease in net interest margin during the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the three months ended September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017, reflected an increase in rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds, with little to no change in rates on new loans. In addition, margin remains relatively stable given the improved mix in core deposits and growth in noninterest-bearing accounts. The increase in net interest margin during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily reflected a decrease in rates paid on funds due to an increase in noninterest-bearing deposits, and an increase in higher-margin interest-earning assets outstanding, reflecting the Company's ongoing redeployment of excess liquidity to grow its portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment. Noninterest Income / Noninterest Expense / Income Tax Expense       Three Months Ended     Nine Months Ended Sept. 30, 2017     June 30, 2017     Sept. 30, 2016 Sept. 30, 2017     Sept. 30, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Noninterest income $ 1.2 $ 1.9 $ 2.2 $ 5.7 $ 7.3 Noninterest expense $ 6.1 $ 6.5 $ 6.4 $ 19.2 $ 19.1 Income tax expense $ 0.6 $ 0.7 $ 0.9 $ 2.1 $ 2.6   The decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of investment securities. Additionally, during the third quarter of 2017, gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale was negatively impacted by Hurricane Irma, which delayed the sale of certain loans the Company had anticipated selling during the quarter. The decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended September 30, 2016, also reflected reduced service charges and fees as well as a decrease in miscellaneous operating income related to an escrow account that was forfeited in the year-earlier period in connection with an OREO sale. The decrease in noninterest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared with that of the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of investment securities, lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans, reduced service charges and fees, and a decrease in miscellaneous operating income (as discussed above), partially offset by higher gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale. The decrease in noninterest expense during the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended September 30, 2016 and June 30, 2017, primarily reflected the positive impact of an adjustment to the rate of accrual for FDIC insurance premiums, reducing the amount accrued through the first nine months in line with current expectations for the full year. The decrease in noninterest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended June 30, 2017, also reflected reduced foreclosed asset expense and a decrease in outside professional services expense, partially offset by an increase in occupancy and equipment expense. The nominal increase in noninterest expense during the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared with that of the nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily reflected increased data processing expenses associated with ongoing efforts to improve the Company's IT infrastructure, partially offset by a decrease in occupancy and equipment expense and the aforementioned adjustment to the rate of accrual for FDIC insurance premiums. The decrease in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared with that of the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, primarily reflected a decline in income before income tax expense, as well as a decrease in the effective tax rate.

ACFC,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Jul 25, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation ACFC, +0.78% : Portfolio loans increased nearly $57 million since June 2016. Deposits increased over $117 million during the last 12 months. Other real estate owned (OREO) declined to less than $0.3 million due to the sale of a $2.4 million foreclosed property. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (Atlantic Coast or the Company, NASDAQ: ACFC), the holding company for Atlantic Coast Bank (the Bank), today reported earnings per diluted share of $0.08 and $0.17 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared with earnings of $0.09 and $0.19 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Commenting on the Company's results, John K. Stephens, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""Atlantic Coast again delivered a solid financial and operational performance in the second quarter of 2017, driven by continued momentum in portfolio lending and deposit growth. These increases underscore the success of our strategy to shift to a commercial business banking franchise and to expand our platform to attractive new markets in central Florida, while we continue to capitalize on our increasing standing in all of our markets. At the same time, we are pleased to note overall credit quality remained stable, while the sale of our last significant foreclosed property resulted in the lowest level of OREO in more than 10 years. Looking forward, our pipelines and new business development efforts are robust and we remain excited about the growth opportunities within our footprint, especially considering our growing focus on commercial lending. I believe our strengths position us well to achieve our aspirational goals and we have the team, talent and tools needed to do so."" Other significant highlights of the second quarter and first half of 2017 included: Net interest income improved to $6.7 million and $13.0 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, from $6.4 million and $12.5 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Net interest margin was 3.19% for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, up from 3.06% and 3.03% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. Total loans (including portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment) increased 8% to $788.2 million at June 30, 2017, from $727.0 million at December 31, 2016, and 4% from $758.6 million at June 30, 2016. The Company's loan growth since both June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, was driven primarily by increased commercial real estate lending in all of its markets. This growth was somewhat offset by portfolio mortgage loan sales as part of the Company's interest rate risk and balance sheet management strategies. Deposits increased 10% to $687.8 million at June 30, 2017, from $628.4 million at December 31, 2016, and 21% from $570.5 million at June 30, 2016. Deposits, excluding brokered deposits, increased 16% to $647.4 million at June 30, 2017, from $558.0 million at December 31, 2016, and 25% from $517.0 million at June 30, 2016. Wholesale funding, which includes brokered deposits and Federal Home Loan Bank advances, decreased 33% to $172.8 million at June 30, 2017, from $259.2 million at December 31, 2016, and 45% from $315.1 million at June 30, 2016. The increase in non-brokered deposits, and resulting decreased reliance on wholesale funding, was driven primarily by the Company's commercial deposit strategies put in place during 2016. Total assets increased to $912.6 million at June 30, 2017, from $907.5 million at December 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in portfolio loans, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, investment securities and other loans (loans held-for-sale and warehouse loans held-for-investment), and decreased from $921.8 million at June 30, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in investment securities and other loans, which were partially offset by an increase in portfolio loans and cash and cash equivalents. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, were 1.10% at June 30, 2017, compared with 1.44% at December 31, 2016, and 0.67% at June 30, 2016. Because of the Company's generally stable credit quality throughout 2016 and continuing through the first half of 2017 due to an overall slowing pace of loan reclassifications to nonperforming, the Company was able to reduce its loan loss provision for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with the same periods in 2016, while maintaining, in management's view, an adequate ratio of allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans. The Bank's ratios of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 (core) capital to adjusted total assets were 12.94% and 10.06%, respectively, at June 30, 2017, and each continued to exceed the levels – 10% and 5%, respectively – currently required for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized. Tracy L. Keegan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, ""Improving net interest margin for both the second quarter and year-to-date period compared with the same periods last year again highlights our operational performance and momentum. With respect to margin, we were pleased to achieve 13 and 16 basis point improvements, respectively, as we continue to reduce our total cost of funds and grow higher-yielding assets. However, competitive conditions continue to be a factor in pricing both loans and deposits and is something that we continually monitor regarding its impact on margin going forward. While all banks are subject to similar pricing issues, we remain confident in Atlantic Coast's specific strategies to drive long-term growth and improved shareholder value.""     Bank Regulatory Capital At Key Capital Measures June 30, 2017     Dec. 31, 2016     June 30, 2016 Total risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 12.94% 14.83% 12.49% Common equity tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.83% 13.58% 11.36% Tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 11.83% 13.58% 11.36% Tier 1 (core) capital ratio (to adjusted total assets) 10.06% 9.44% 9.06%   The year-over-year increase in capital ratios at June 30, 2017 was due primarily to an increase in capital related to higher earnings over the past year. The decrease in risk-weighted capital ratios at June 30, 2017, compared with December 31, 2016, reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets, due to growth in portfolio loans and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents and investment securities, as well as an increase in the risk weighting of certain portfolio loan categories.     Credit Quality At June 30, 2017     Dec. 31, 2016     June 30, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Nonperforming loans $ 9.8 $ 10.1 $ 3.4 Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.36 % 1.57 % 0.51 % Other real estate owned $ 0.3 $ 2.9 $ 2.7 Nonperforming assets $ 10.1 $ 13.0 $ 6.1 Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.10 % 1.44 % 0.67 % Troubled debt restructurings performing for less than 12 months under terms of modification [ (1)] $ 17.2 $ 14.6 $ 5.1 Troubled debt restructurings performing for more than 12 months under terms of modification $ 15.9 $ 20.3 $ 29.8 _________________________ [(1)] Includes $7.8 million, $7.9 million, and $0.8 million of nonperforming loans at June 30, 2017, December 31, 2016, and June 30, 2016, respectively.   While nonperforming assets have declined for three consecutive quarters, the current level exceeded that of the year-earlier period, reflecting the reclassification of two specific loans to nonperforming status during the third quarter of 2016. That aside, the Company's overall credit quality remains stable as the general pace of loans reclassified to nonperforming remained slow during the last 12 months. Importantly, OREO declined significantly as of June 30, 2017, compared with that at June 30, 2016 and December 31, 2016, primarily due to the sale of a $2.4 million foreclosed property in May 2017.         Provision / Allowance for Loan Losses At and for the Three Months Ended At and for the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017     March 31, 2017     June 30, 2016 June 30, 2017     June 30, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Provision for portfolio loan losses $ 0.2 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 $ 0.3 $ 0.3 Allowance for portfolio loan losses $ 8.2 $ 8.3 $ 8.0 $ 8.2 $ 8.0 Allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans 1.14 % 1.20 % 1.21 % 1.14 % 1.21 % Allowance for portfolio loan losses to nonperforming loans 83.61 % 84.67 % 235.28 % 83.61 % 235.28 % Net charge-offs (recoveries) $ 0.2 $ 0.0 $ (0.1 ) $ 0.2 $ 0.1 Net charge-offs (recoveries) to average outstanding portfolio loans (annualized) 0.14 % 0.00 % (0.03 )% 0.07 % 0.02 %   The Company's provision for portfolio loan losses has trended within a relatively narrow range over the past year. It was slightly lower for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with the second quarter last year, and was down 17% for the first six months ended June 30, 2017, versus the first half of 2016. This reflects a trend of solid economic conditions in the Company's markets, which has led to continued low levels of net charge-offs during the last 12 months. The increase in the allowance for portfolio loan losses at June 30, 2017, compared with that at June 30, 2016, was attributable primarily to loan growth, which reflected organic growth supplemented by strategic loan purchases that were offset partially by loan sales, principal amortization, and increased prepayments of one- to four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans. Management believes the allowance for portfolio loan losses at June 30, 2017, is sufficient to absorb losses in portfolio loans as of the end of the period. Net charge-offs remained at a low level during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, but were higher compared with the same periods in 2016 and during the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily due to the charge-off of one home equity loan and one commercial loan.         Net Interest Income Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2017     March 31, 2017     June 30, 2016 June 30, 2017     June 30, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Net interest income $ 6.7 $ 6.4 $ 6.4 $ 13.0 $ 12.5 Net interest margin 3.19 % 3.20 % 3.06 % 3.19 % 3.03 % Yield on investment securities 2.35 % 2.42 % 2.08 % 2.38 % 2.06 % Yield on loans 4.25 % 4.26 % 4.38 % 4.26 % 4.42 % Total cost of funds 0.91 % 0.80 % 1.04 % 0.87 % 1.06 % Average cost of deposits 0.75 % 0.67 % 0.61 % 0.72 % 0.59 % Rates paid on borrowed funds 1.92 % 1.77 % 2.01 % 1.85 % 2.18 %   The increase in net interest margin during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily reflected a decrease in rates paid on borrowed funds. Also contributing to the increase in net interest margin was an increase in higher-margin interest-earning assets outstanding, reflecting the Company's ongoing redeployment of excess liquidity to grow its portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment. The slight decrease in net interest margin during the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017, reflected an increase in rates paid on funds, as well as a decrease in the yield earned on loans and investment securities.         Noninterest Income / Noninterest Expense / Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, 2017     March 31, 2017     June 30, 2016 June 30, 2017     June 30, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Noninterest income $ 1.9 $ 2.6 $ 2.5 $ 4.5 $ 5.1 Noninterest expense $ 6.5 $ 6.6 $ 6.6 $ 13.0 $ 12.7 Income tax expense $ 0.7 $ 0.8 $ 0.8 $ 1.5 $ 1.7   The decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2017, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale associated with the volatility in U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) lending and the related gains on the sale of USDA loans, partially offset by higher gains on the sale of investment securities. The decrease in noninterest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended June 30, 2016, also reflected lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans. The decrease in noninterest income for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily reflected lower gains on the sale of investment securities, lower gains on the sale of portfolio loans and reduced service charges and fees, partially offset by higher gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale. Noninterest expense decreased nominally during the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended June 30, 2016 and March 31, 2017. The increase in noninterest expense during the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily reflected increased data processing expenses associated with ongoing efforts to improve the Company's IT infrastructure, as well as increased interchange expense and other miscellaneous operating expenses. The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended June 30, 2016, as well as for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with that of the six months ended June 30, 2016, primarily reflected a decline in income before income tax expense, as well as a decrease in the effective tax rate.

ACFC,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla., Apr 25, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation ACFC, +0.78% : Portfolio loans increased over $42 million in the first three months of 2017. Deposits increased over $57 million in the first three months of 2017. Credit quality remained stable during the first three months of 2017. Core earnings per diluted share increased $0.03, or 43%, over first quarter last year. Atlantic Coast Financial Corporation (Atlantic Coast or the Company, NASDAQ: ACFC), the holding company for Atlantic Coast Bank (the Bank), today reported earnings per diluted share of $0.10 for the first quarter of 2017 compared with earnings of $0.10 per diluted share in the same quarter last year. Results for the three months ended March 31, 2016, included the benefit of gains on the sale of investment securities totaling $0.5 million. Excluding the effects of these gains on the sale of investment securities, core earnings per diluted share increased 43% to $0.10 for the three months ended March 31, 2017, from $0.07 for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Core earnings per diluted share is a non-GAAP financial measure, and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is presented on page 5. Commenting on the Company's results, John K. Stephens, Jr., President and Chief Executive Officer, said, ""We are pleased that Atlantic Coast has posted a solid start to 2017, highlighted by continued growth in deposits, which increased nearly 25% year over year. Our first quarter results not only demonstrate continued momentum in growing our loan portfolio, with a net increase of over $42 million during the quarter, they also highlight our success in attracting core deposits, which grew over $57 million during the quarter. This excess of core deposit growth over our loan growth contributes to our strategy to reduce our overall reliance on wholesale funding. Additionally, gains on sale of loans continue to increase as part of our core strategies; however, the amount of these gains may continue to vary significantly on a quarter-over-quarter basis depending on their pace through our loan pipeline, as well as other potential factors. Our first quarter progress also is noteworthy because it underscores the diversity of business, which has helped us maintain the momentum we achieved last year, even as we prepare for the potential effects of possible interest rate increases or other macroeconomic events that may affect the industry nationwide, as well as the seasonally slow nature of the first quarter. We remain focused on helping our communities by providing extraordinary service to our customers, including a wide range of borrowing opportunities for individuals and commercial enterprises, including small businesses. Considering our ongoing success and the opportunities we see across our markets, I believe Atlantic Coast remains well positioned to continue to build on the growth and expansion we have worked so hard to achieve over the past few years."" Other significant highlights of the first quarter of 2017 included: Net interest income improved to $6.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, from $6.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Net interest margin was 3.20% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, up from 2.99% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Total loans (including portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment) increased 2% to $741.8 million at March 31, 2017, from $727.0 million at December 31, 2016, and 3% from $721.5 million at March 31, 2016. The Company's loan growth since both March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2016, reflected originations in all lines of business, supplemented by selective loan acquisitions, partially offset by loan sales, principal amortization, and prepayments. Nonperforming assets, as a percentage of total assets, were 1.36% at March 31, 2017, compared with 1.44% at December 31, 2016, and 0.86% at March 31, 2016. Because of the Company's generally stable credit quality throughout 2016 and continuing in the first quarter of 2017, reflecting an overall slowing pace of loan reclassifications, the Company was able to reduce its loan loss provision for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with the same period in 2016, while maintaining, in management's view, an adequate ratio of allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans. Total assets increased to $923.8 million at March 31, 2017, from $907.5 million at December 31, 2016, and $893.0 million at March 31, 2016, primarily due to increases in portfolio loans and investment securities, which were partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, as well as in other loans (loans held-for-sale and warehouse loans held-for-investment). The Bank's ratios of total risk-based capital to risk-weighted assets and Tier 1 (core) capital to adjusted total assets were 13.76% and 10.32%, respectively, at March 31, 2017, and each continued to exceed the levels – 10% and 5%, respectively – currently required for the Bank to be considered well-capitalized. Tracy L. Keegan, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, added, ""We were pleased to see further improvements in key financial metrics during the first quarter of 2017. Net interest margin increased 21 basis points versus the prior-year period and was down 10 basis points compared with the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily due to a decrease in the yield earned on loans and an increase in cost of deposits, which links with our strategies to optimize the core funding of our loan growth. Additionally, better credit quality for the first quarter reflected the second consecutive quarterly improvement in the level of nonperforming loans. Despite the reclassification of two particular loans in the third quarter of 2016, comprising two legacy loans excluded from our bulk sale in 2013, total nonperforming assets are only $5.3 million greater than those reported at the end of the first quarter last year. Meanwhile the strength of our coverage for possible portfolio loan losses, as measured by the allowance to total portfolio loans, remains virtually level with the year-earlier period.""     Bank Regulatory Capital At Key Capital Measures March 31, 2017     Dec. 31, 2016     March 31, 2016 Total risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 13.76% 14.83% 13.08% Common equity tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 12.56% 13.58% 11.91% Tier 1 (core) risk-based capital ratio (to risk-weighted assets) 12.56% 13.58% 11.91% Tier 1 (core) capital ratio (to adjusted total assets) 10.32% 9.44% 9.20%   The year-over-year increase in capital ratios at March 31, 2017, primarily reflected an increase in investment securities, which resulted in a decrease in risk-weighted assets and adjusted total assets. Additionally, the increase in each of the Bank's capital ratios at March 31, 2017, reflected an increase in capital related to higher earnings over the past year. The sequential decrease in risk-weighted capital ratios for the first quarter of 2017 compared with the fourth quarter of 2016 reflected an increase in risk-weighted assets, due to growth in portfolio loans and a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, as well as an increase in the risk weighting of certain portfolio loan categories, partially offset by an increase in investment securities.         Credit Quality At March 31, 2017       Dec. 31, 2016       March 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Nonperforming loans $ 9.8 $ 10.1 $ 4.5 Nonperforming loans to total portfolio loans 1.42 % 1.57 % 0.69 % Other real estate owned $ 2.8 $ 2.9 $ 3.2 Nonperforming assets $ 12.6 $ 13.0 $ 7.7 Nonperforming assets to total assets 1.36 % 1.44 % 0.86 % Troubled debt restructurings performing for less than 12 months under terms of modification [ (1)] $ 13.6 $ 14.6 $ 4.5 Troubled debt restructurings performing for more than 12 months under terms of modification $ 18.9 $ 20.3 $ 31.2   [(1)] Includes $7.6 million, $7.9 million, $0.8 million of nonperforming loans at March 31, 2017, December 31, 2016, and March 31, 2016, respectively.   Although nonperforming assets were higher at March 31, 2017, compared with March 31, 2016, the Company's overall credit quality remains stable, as reflected by the decrease in nonperforming assets at the end of the first quarter of 2017, compared with those at the end of the last two sequential quarters. Aside from the reclassification of two specific loans to nonperforming during the third quarter of 2016, the general pace of loans reclassified to nonperforming and OREO continued to slow during the last 12 months.           Provision / Allowance for Loan Losses At and for the Three Months Ended March 31, 2017       Dec. 31, 2016       March 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Provision for portfolio loan losses $ 0.1 $ 0.1 $ 0.2 Allowance for portfolio loan losses $ 8.3 $ 8.2 $ 7.8 Allowance for portfolio loan losses to total portfolio loans 1.20 % 1.26 % 1.20 % Allowance for portfolio loan losses to nonperforming loans 84.67 % 80.38 % 174.50 % Net charge-offs $ 0.0 $ 0.0 $ 0.1 Net charge-offs to average outstanding portfolio loans (annualized) 0.00 % 0.02 % 0.08 %   The Company's provision for portfolio loan losses, which has trended within a moderately narrow range over the past year, was lower for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with that for the three months ended March 31, 2016, but higher compared with that for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This reflects a trend of solid economic conditions in the Company's markets, which has led to continued low levels of net charge-offs during the last 12 months. The increase in the allowance for portfolio loan losses at March 31, 2017, compared with that at March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2016, was primarily attributable to loan growth, which reflected organic growth supplemented by strategic loan purchases that were partially offset by loan sales, principal amortization, and increased prepayments of one- to four-family residential mortgages and home equity loans. Management believes the allowance for portfolio loan losses at March 31, 2017, is sufficient to absorb losses in portfolio loans as of the end of the period. Net charge-offs remained at a low level during the three months ended March 31, 2017, similar to the same period in 2016 and during the three months ended December 31, 2016.         Net Interest Income Three Months Ended March 31, 2017       Dec. 31, 2016       March 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Net interest income $ 6.4 $ 7.1 $ 6.1 Net interest margin 3.20% 3.30% 2.99% Yield on investment securities 2.42% 2.29% 2.04% Yield on loans 4.26% 4.40% 4.46% Total cost of funds 0.80% 0.78% 1.08% Average cost of deposits 0.67% 0.66% 0.58% Rates paid on borrowed funds 1.77% 1.14% 2.37%   The increase in net interest margin during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily reflected a decrease in rates paid on borrowed funds. Also contributing to the increase in net interest margin was an increase in higher-margin interest-earning assets outstanding, reflecting the Company's ongoing redeployment of excess liquidity to grow its portfolio loans, loans held-for-sale, and warehouse loans held-for-investment. The decrease in net interest margin during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with net interest margin for the three months ended December 31, 2016, reflected an increase in rates paid on borrowed funds and a decrease in the yield earned on loans.           Noninterest Income / Noninterest Expense / Income Tax Expense Three Months Ended March 31, 2017       Dec. 31, 2016       March 31, 2016 (Dollars in millions) Noninterest income $ 2.6 $ 1.9 $ 2.6 Noninterest expense $ 6.6 $ 6.0 $ 6.1 Income tax expense $ 0.8 $ 1.0 $ 0.9   Noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2017, was virtually flat compared with that of the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to higher gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale, offset by lower gains on the sale of investment securities and a decrease in service charges and fees. The increase in noninterest income for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected higher gains on the sale of loans held-for-sale, partially offset by lower gains from the extinguishment of FHLB advances (the FHLB Gain) and a decrease in service charges and fees. The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily reflected increased foreclosed asset data processing expenses, as well as increased interchange expense and other miscellaneous operating expenses. The increase in noninterest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended December 31, 2016, primarily reflected increased incentive compensation costs associated with management's successful execution of the Company's continuing growth strategies, as well as increased occupancy and equipment expense and other miscellaneous operating expenses. The decrease in income tax expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared with that of the three months ended March 31, 2016 and December 31, 2016, reflected the decrease in income before income tax expense. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures This press release includes a discussion of ""non-GAAP financial measures:"" core earnings and core earnings per diluted share. A non-GAAP financial measure is generally defined as a numerical measure of a company's historical or future financial performance, financial position, or cash flows that either excludes or includes amounts, or is subject to adjustments, so as to be different from the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Core earnings and core earnings per diluted share exclude the effects of certain transactions that occurred during the period, as detailed in the following reconciliation of these measures.         Three Months Ended March 31, 2017       Dec. 31, 2016       March 31, 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Net income, as reported $ 1,477 $ 2,002 $ 1,524 Less the gain on the sale of investment securities [ (1)] -- -- (521 ) Less the FHLB Gain [ (2)]   --   (255 )   --   Adjusted net income (core earnings) $ 1,477 $ 1,747   $ 1,003     Income per diluted share, as reported $ 0.10 $ 0.13 $ 0.10 Less the gain on the sale of investment securities -- -- (0.03 ) Less the FHLB Gain   --   (0.02 )   --   Adjusted income per diluted share (core earnings per diluted share) [ (3)] $ 0.10 $ 0.11   $ 0.07     [(1)] The gain on the sale of investment securities, which is included in noninterest income, totaled $828,000, and is shown above net of a tax expense adjustment of $307,000. [(2)] The FHLB Gain, which is included in noninterest income, totaled $412,000, and is shown above net of a tax expense adjustment of $157,000. [(3)] May not foot due to rounding. Core earnings and core earnings per diluted share should be viewed in addition to, and not as a substitute for or superior to, net income and income per diluted share on a GAAP basis. Atlantic Coast's management believes that the non-GAAP financial measures, when considered together with GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results separate and apart from items that may, or could, have a disproportionately positive or negative impact on results in any particular period. Atlantic Coast's management also believes that the non-GAAP financial measures aid investors in analyzing the Company's business trends and in understanding the Company's performance. In addition, the Company may utilize non-GAAP financial measures as guides in forecasting, budgeting and long-term planning processes and to measure operating performance for some management compensation purposes.
