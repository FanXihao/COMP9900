You should not place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. We undertake no obligation to update our forward-looking statements made herein, unless required by law. Primarily as a result of these new investments, net of realizations, and write-downs of legacy energy investments, the exposure of our investment portfolio to the energy sector decreased to 13% at December 31, 2017. Subsequent to year end, on February 15, 2018, Talos Production, LLC, or Talos, redeemed our remaining position in its senior unsecured notes of $11.5 million at par, thus reducing our energy exposure to $0.

The decrease of $7.6 million was primarily due to Castex Energy 2005, LP which was placed on non-accrual status in January 2017, lower average portfolio loan balances from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, and a decrease in non-recurring fee income of $0.4 million.

Interest expense and bank fees increased by 2.8% to $3.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from $3.8 million compared to prior year largely due to higher interest rates on the Credit Facility. Management fees decreased by 34.3% to $1.9 million from $2.9 million due to lower average asset base subject to the base management fee during 2017. Other general and administrative expenses decreased by 12.8% to $1.4 million from $1.7 million primarily due to a decrease in travel related costs and other employee related expenses in 2017. Additionally, incentive fees of $89,000 were waived for 2017. On November 10, 2017, we entered into an Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement with OHA whereby OHA agreed to waive any incentive fees earned relating to fiscal years 2017 and 2018.

We may invest in newly issued securities and acquire investments in the secondary market. We do not currently intend to invest in mortgage-related structured products. Portfolio and 2017 Investment Activity Investments are considered to be fully realized when the original investment at the security level has been fully exited. Internal rate of return, or IRR, is a measure of our discounted cash flows (inflows and outflows). Specifically, IRR is the discount rate at which the net present value of all cash flows is equal to zero. That is, IRR is the discount rate at which the present value of total capital invested in our investments is equal to the present value of all realized returns from the investments. Our IRR calculations are unaudited. Capital invested, with respect to an investment, represents the aggregate cost of the investment, net of any upfront fees paid at closing. Realized returns, with respect to an investment, represents the total cash received with respect to an investment, including all amortization payments, interest, dividends, prepayment fees, administrative fees, amendment fees, accrued interest, and other fees and proceeds. Gross IRR, with respect to an investment, is calculated based on the dates that we invested capital and dates we received distributions.

As of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the total fair value of our portfolio investments was $84.5 million and $105.0 million, respectively. Of those fair value totals, approximately $35.7 million, or 42.2%, as of June 30, 2017, and $60.9 million, or 58.0%, as of December 31, 2016 are determined using significant unobservable (i.e., Level 3) inputs. Results of Operations Investment Income Investment income includes interest on our investments and dividend income. Dividend income is income we receive from certain of our equity investments. Other income includes prepayment fees and modification fees we receive in connection with certain of our investments. These fees are recognized as earned.

The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.5 million decrease in investment income related to non-accrual assets and a decrease in average portfolio balance for the three months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016.  For the three months ended Operating Expenses June 30, For the six months ended June 30, (in thousands) 2017 2016 2017 2016 Interest expense and bank fees $ 984 $ 975 $ 1,958 $ 2,063 Management and incentive fees 496 767 1,066 1,697 Professional fees 401 669 672 1,389 Other general and administrative expenses 377 538 759 1,044 Directors fees 62 62 123 123 Total operating expenses $ 2,320 $ 3,011 $ 4,578 $ 6,316  For the three months ended June 30, 2017, operating expenses decreased by 22.9% to $2.3 million from $3.0 million compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. Interest expense and bank fees increased by 0.9% to $1.0 million from $1.0 million compared to the same period in the prior year largely due to higher borrowing costs partially offset by decreased weighted average debt outstanding of $17.4 million. Management and incentive fees decreased by 35.3% to $0.5 million from $0.8 million due to lower base management fees as a result of lower average asset base subject to the base management fee. Professional fees decreased by 40.1% to $0.4 million from $0.7 million due to lower legal fees and audit related expenses in the 2017 period. Other general and administrative expenses decreased by 29.9% to $0.4 million from $0.5 million primarily due to a decrease in employee related expenses in the 2017 period.

During the six month period ended June 30, 2017, the decrease in net investment income compared to the six month period ended June 30, 2016 was driven by lower investment income, partially offset by lower operating expenses in 2017.

For the three months ended June 30, 2016, we realized a capital loss of $10.1 million related to the sale of our equity interest in Contour and the extinguishment of the associated senior secured term loan and unsecured promissory note. This realized capital loss was partially offset by a realized capital gain of $0.2 million related to the sale of the $5.4 million Hanson second lien term loan.

OHAI,"NEW YORK, Mar 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OHA Investment Corporation OHAI, -1.43% (the ""Company"") today announced its financial results for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Management will discuss the Company's results summarized below on a conference call on Tuesday, March 27, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time. Summary financial results for the quarter ended December 31, 2017: Total investment income: $2.6 million, or $0.13 per share Net investment income: $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share Net realized and unrealized gains: $0.7 million, or $0.03 per share Net asset value: $47.8 million, or $2.37 per share (vs. $2.34 per share at September 30, 2017) Full realization of two OHA portfolio investments: $14.8 million Fair value of portfolio investments: $64.9 million [(1)] Portfolio Activity - Three months ended December 31, 2017 The fair value of our investment portfolio was $64.9 million at December 31, 2017, decreasing 17.5% compared to September 30, 2017 and 38.2% compared to December 31, 2016. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company had realizations totaling $14.9 million and made no new investments. The concentration of our investment portfolio in the energy sector decreased to 13% at December 31, 2017, compared to 38% at December 31, 2016. The current weighted average yield of our portfolio based on the cost and fair value of our yielding investments was 13.2% and 14.0%, respectively, as of December 31, 2017. Realizations during the quarter totaled $14.9 million which consisted of the full repayment of two of our portfolio investments made under OHA: (i) Appriss Holdings, Inc's, second lien term loan in the amount of $9.3 million; and (ii) Royal Holdings, Inc.'s second lien term loan in the amount of $5.5 million, and $0.1 million of amortization on existing portfolio investments. Our investment in Appriss was initiated in November 2014 and generated an unlevered gross internal rate of return of 10.9% and a return on investment of 1.26x. Our investment in Royal was initiated in June 2015 and generated an unlevered gross internal rate of return of 9.6% and return on investment of 1.19x. Subsequent to year end, our energy exposure was reduced to 0% as a result of the full redemption of our $11.5 million investment in the unsecured notes of Talos Production, LLC (""Talos""), at par, on February 15, 2018. The redemption was $2.9 million, or $0.14 per share, greater than Talos' fair value of $8.6 million (marked at 75% of par) at December 31, 2017. This legacy energy investment was initiated in February 2013 and generated an unlevered gross internal rate of return of 9.95% and a return on investment of 1.30x. Operating Results - Three months ended December 31, 2017 Investment income totaled $2.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, decreasing 35.8% compared to $4.0 million in the corresponding quarter of 2016. The decrease in investment income during the fourth quarter of 2017 was primarily as a result of a decrease in average portfolio investment balance, lower weighted average yield on investment portfolio, Castex Energy 2005, LP, (""Castex"") being placed on non-accrual in January 2017 and lower production payments on our investment in ATP Oil & Gas limited term royalty interest (""ATP""). In the fourth quarter of 2016, we recognized $828 thousand and $371 thousand of income related to our investments in Castex and ATP, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we did not recognize any income related to these two investments. Operating expenses, net of incentive fee waiver, for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $2.3 million, decreasing 8.7%, compared to $2.4 million in the corresponding quarter of 2016. The decrease was attributable to lower base management fees in 2017 and a reversal of incentive fees in 2017, partially offset by higher professional fees. Management fees in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.2 million lower than in the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of lower average asset base subject to the base management fee. The decrease in expenses were partially offset by $0.1 million increase in professional fees driven by higher legal costs in 2017 associated with our investment in Castex. Operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 included an $89,000 fee waiver for incentive fees. On November 10, 2017, we entered into an Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement with OHA whereby OHA agreed to waive any incentive fees earned relating to fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Under the Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement, any capital gains fees that would have been earned and accrued during 2017 and 2018, which under our investment advisory agreement would not have been paid until 2018 and 2019, respectively, will be waived. Resulting net investment income was $0.4 million, or $0.02 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.6 million, or $0.08 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2016. We recorded net realized and unrealized gains on investments totaling $0.7 million, or $0.03 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $12.9 million, or $0.64 per share, during the fourth quarter of 2016. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we recognized a tax benefit of $0.6 million, or $0.03 per share, related to the repeal of the corporate alternative minimum tax (""AMT"") under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (""Jobs Act"") that was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The $0.6 million of AMT credits were generated between the years 2008 and 2012 related to realized losses of certain legacy portfolio investments. Prior to the Jobs Act, we had a full valuation allowance against the AMT credits. Overall, we experienced a net increase in net assets resulting from operations of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per share, for the fourth quarter of 2017. After declaring a quarterly dividend during the period of $0.02 per share, our net asset value increased 1.3%, from $2.34 per share as of September 30, 2017 to $2.37 per share as of December 31, 2017. In February 2018, we exercised our option to extend our credit facility with Midcap through September 9, 2018. Operating Results - Year ended December 31, 2017 Investment income totaled $10.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreasing 42.6% compared to $17.9 million in 2016. The decrease in 2017 was primarily due to a lower average investment balance from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017, placement of our investment in Castex on non-accrual in January 2017 and lower production payments from our investment in ATP/Bennu. Operating expenses, net of incentive fee waiver, in 2017 totaled $9.2 million, decreasing 18.9%, compared to $11.4 million in 2016. The decrease was attributable to lower base management and incentive fees, partially offset by higher interest expense and bank fees and professional fees. Management fees decreased 40.0% to $1.9 million from $3.2 million due to lower incentive fees incurred in 2016, $89,000 incentive fee waiver in 2017 and lower average asset base subject to the base management fee during 2016. The increase in professional fees is attributable to higher legal expenses related to our investment in Castex. Resulting net investment income for 2017 was $1.0 million, or $0.05 per share, compared to $6.5 million, or $0.32 per share, of net investment income in 2016. We recorded net realized and unrealized losses on investments totaling $32.1 million, or $1.59 per share, during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $31.9 million, or $1.58 per share, in 2016. Our investment in Castex, a legacy energy related portfolio company, contributed $33.5 million, or $1.66 per share of the net realized and unrealized losses in 2017. Overall, we experienced a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $31.1 million, or $1.54 per share, during the year ended December 31, 2017. As a result, and after declaring dividends during the year of $0.08 per share, our net asset value decreased to $2.37 per share as of December 31, 2017 from $3.99 per share as of December 31, 2016. Review of Strategic Alternatives As previously discussed on our November 14, 2017 earnings call, OHAI's Board of Directors has decided to explore a variety of options that could provide more scale to OHAI. These options could include, among other things, raising additional capital, a merger or joint venture with another party, the acquisition of existing investment portfolios, or other strategic transactions. To assist OHAI in this process, the Board has retained Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc. (""KBW"") as its financial advisor and investment banker. While we are actively working with KBW to explore these options and committed to taking actions that we believe will maximize shareholder value, there is no assurance that the Company will execute on any of them. No specific timetable or formal process has been set and OHAI does not expect to comment further or periodically provide updates to the market with additional information unless and until the Company's Board of Directors has approved a specific transaction or otherwise deems disclosure appropriate or necessary. Webcast / Conference Call at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time on March 27, 2018 We invite all interested persons to participate in our conference call on Tuesday, March 27, 2018, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern Time.

OHAI,"NEW YORK, Mar 14, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OHA Investment Corporation OHAI, -1.43% (the ""Company"") today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly distribution of $0.02 per share. Quarterly Distribution Declaration The quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.02 per common share will be paid April 9, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 31, 2018. Distributions are paid from taxable earnings and may include a return of capital and/or capital gains. The amount of distributable income for each quarter depends on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Company during the entire year. Distributions may consist of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital, but the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the Company's fiscal year. The specific tax characteristics of distributions paid during calendar 2018 will be reported to each stockholder on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year. The Board of Directors of the Company has the discretion to change the amount of the distribution in any given quarter based on the Company's estimate, as of that quarter, of its taxable income for the year. The Company's estimate of its taxable income for 2018, and therefore the amount of each quarterly distribution in 2018, may change depending on a variety of factors, including the performance of the Company's portfolio investments. The Company has an ""opt out"" dividend reinvestment plan, or ""DRIP,"" for its stockholders. Consequently, when the Company declares a distribution, stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP automatically have their distribution reinvested in shares of the Company's stock, rather than receiving it in cash. A stockholder who has elected to receive distributions in cash may re-enroll in the DRIP at any time by notifying the plan administrator.

OHAI,"NEW YORK, Nov 13, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OHA Investment Corporation OHAI, -1.43% (the ""Company"") today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Management will discuss the Company's results summarized below on a conference call on Tuesday, November 14, 2017, at 1:30 p.m.(Eastern Time). Summary results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017: Total investment income: $2.8 million, or $0.14 per share Net investment income: $0.3 million, or $0.02 per share Net realized and unrealized gains and (losses): $(8.5) million, or $(0.42) per share Net asset value: $47.1 million, or $2.34 per share New portfolio investments during the quarter: $10.7 million par Fair value of portfolio investments: $78.7 million Investment in Castex Energy 2005, LP written down by $7.6 million, or $0.38 per share Portfolio Activity The fair value of our investment portfolio was $78.7 million at September 30, 2017, decreasing 6.9% compared to June 30, 2017. During the third quarter of 2017, the Company had realizations totaling $8.9 million and investments in four new portfolio companies in the amount of $10.6 million. The concentration of our investment portfolio in the energy sector at September 30, 2017 was 9%. The current weighted average yield of our portfolio based on the cost and fair value of our yielding investments was 12.4% and 13.1%, respectively, as of September 30, 2017. In July 2017, we sold $8.0 million of the senior unsecured notes of TIBCO Software, Inc. at an average price of 110.38% of par, resulting in realized capital gains of $1.0 million, or $0.05 per share. Starting in July 2017, we purchased $3.0 million of second lien term loan of DexKo Global, Inc., or DexKo, a global supplier of highly engineered running gear technology, chassis assemblies, and related components. The DexKo second lien term loan was purchased in a series of transactions at an average discount of 0.78% to par, earns interest payable in cash at a rate of LIBOR+8.25% with a 1% floor and matures in July 2025. In August 2017, we purchased $1.3 million of second lien term loan of Hayward Industries, Inc., or Hayward, a leading global manufacturer of residential and commercial pool equipment, automation and accessories. The Hayward second lien term loan was purchased at a 1.75% discount to par, earns interest payable in cash at a rate of LIBOR+8.25% and matures in August 2025. In September 2017, we purchased $5.0 million of the senior unsecured notes of Avantor Performance Materials, Inc., or Avantor, a leading global provider of ultra-high purity materials and customized solutions for the biopharmaceutical, biomaterials, research, diagnostics, electronics, aerospace and defense industries. The senior unsecured notes of Avantor were purchased at par, earns interest payable in cash at a fixed rate of 9.0% per annum and matures in October 2025. Also in September 2017, we purchased $1.4 million of second lien term loan of Helix Acquisition Holdings, Inc., an affiliate of MW Industries, Inc., or MWI, a leading manufacturer of highly engineered, mission critical springs and fasteners for original equipment manufacturer and after-market applications serving a wide range of end-markets, including medical, heavy equipment, military and automotive. The MWI second lien term loan was purchased at 1.0% discount to par, earns interest payable in cash at a rate of LIBOR+ 8.00% and matures in September 2025. On October 16, 2017, Castex announced that it (together with certain affiliates) had filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. According to the filing, Castex and its affiliates in bankruptcy have entered into a restructuring support agreement (""RSA"") with pre-petition lenders holding approximately 86% in principal amount of claims under the pre-petition credit facility. The RSA outlines a plan of reorganization for Castex and its affiliates in bankruptcy. As currently proposed, the RSA does not provide for any recovery to the holder of the preferred limited partnership units of Castex, including those preferred limited partnership unit holders who have exercised their put rights. OHAI is not a party to the RSA and is exploring all available options in and out of bankruptcy for recovery on its investment in Castex. At this time we are unable to determine the form and value of a recovery, if any, we expect to receive due in large part to the inherent risks and uncertainty associated with bankruptcy and litigation. Operating Results Investment income totaled $2.8 million for the third quarter of 2017, decreasing 36.3% compared to $4.3 million in the corresponding quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.2 million decrease in investment income related to non-accrual energy related assets and a decrease in average portfolio balance. Operating expenses for the third quarter of 2017 were $2.4 million, a decrease of $0.2 million, or 7.8%, compared to operating expenses for the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in operating expenses is related to lower base management and inventive fees of $0.3 million, lower professional fees and other general administrative expenses of $0.1 million, partially offset by higher interest expense and bank fees of $0.2 million. The resulting net investment income was $0.3 million or $0.02 per share, for the third quarter of 2017, compared to $1.7 million, or $0.08 per share, for the third quarter of 2016. We recorded net realized and unrealized losses on investments totaling $8.5 million, or $(0.42) per share, during the third quarter of 2017, compared to $4.3 million, or $0.21 per share, during the third quarter of 2016. Total losses recorded in the third quarter of 2017 were driven primarily by the $7.6 million write-down in Castex, a legacy energy portfolio investment and the $1.0 million write-down in our investments in OCI Holdings, Inc., a legacy non-energy portfolio investment. Overall, we experienced a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $8.2 million, or $0.40 per share, for the third quarter of 2017. After declaring a quarterly dividend during the period of $0.02 per share, our net asset value decreased 15.2%, from $2.76 per share as of June 30, 2017 to $2.34 per share as of September 30, 2017. On November 10, 2017, we entered into an Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement with OHA whereby OHA agreed to waive any incentive fees earned relating to fiscal years 2017 and 2018. Under the Incentive Fee Waiver Agreement, any capitalized gains fees that would have been earned and accrued during 2017 and 2018, which under our investment advisory agreement would not have been paid until 2018 and 2019, respectively, will be waived. Liquidity and Capital Resources At September 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $16.6 million, which does not take into account the $6.4 million due to broker for unsettled trades at the end of the third quarter. The total amount outstanding under our credit facility at September 30, 2017 was $40.5 million with $0.0 million available to draw. On November 10, 2017, we entered into an amendment to the Credit Facility whereby we agreed to make a voluntary principal prepayment in the amount of $4.5 million, reducing the total principal amount outstanding to $36.0 million, and the lenders agreed not to test certain covenants at certain determination dates.

OHAI,"NEW YORK, Sep 18, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OHA Investment Corporation OHAI, -1.43% (the ""Company"") today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly distribution of $0.02 per share. Quarterly Distribution Declaration The quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.02 per common share will be paid October 9, 2017 to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2017. Distributions are paid from taxable earnings and may include a return of capital and/or capital gains. The amount of distributable income for each quarter depends on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Company during the entire year. Distributions may consist of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital, but the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the Company's fiscal year. The specific tax characteristics of distributions paid during calendar 2017 will be reported to each stockholder on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year. The Board of Directors of the Company has the discretion to change the amount of the distribution in any given quarter based on the Company's estimate, as of that quarter, of its taxable income for the year. The Company's estimate of its taxable income for 2017, and therefore the amount of each quarterly distribution in 2017, may change depending on a variety of factors, including the performance of the Company's portfolio investments. The Company has an ""opt out"" dividend reinvestment plan, or ""DRIP,"" for its stockholders. Consequently, when the Company declares a distribution, stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP automatically have their distribution reinvested in shares of the Company's stock, rather than receiving it in cash. A stockholder who has elected to receive distributions in cash may re-enroll in the DRIP at any time by notifying the plan administrator.

OHAI,"NEW YORK, Aug 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OHA Investment Corporation OHAI, -1.43% (the ""Company"") today announced its financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Management will discuss the Company's results summarized below on a conference call on Friday, August 11, 2017, at 10:00 a.m. (Eastern Time). Summary results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017: Total investment income: $2.5 million, or $0.12 per share Net investment income: $0.1 million, or $0.01 per share Net realized and unrealized losses: $5.0 million, or $0.25 per share Net asset value: $55.7 million, or $2.76 per share New portfolio investments during the quarter: $1.4 million Fair value of portfolio investments: $84.5 million Investment in Castex Energy 2005, LP written down by $4.7 million, or $0.23 per share Portfolio Activity The fair value of our investment portfolio was $84.5 million at June 30, 2017, decreasing 4.7% compared to March 31, 2017. During the second quarter of 2017, the Company had realizations totaling $1.4 million and made one new investment in the amount of $1.4 million. The concentration of our investment portfolio in the energy sector at June 30, 2017 was 18%. The current weighted average yield of our portfolio based on the cost and fair value of our yielding investments was 12.6% and 13.0%, respectively, as of June 30, 2017. During the second quarter, we added $1.4 million of second lien term loan to PAE Holding Corporation, or PAE, adding to our $5.5 million position that was previously acquired in November 2016. The $1.4 million PAE loan was purchased at a 1% discount and earns interest payable in cash at a rate of 10.50% per annum (LIBOR+9.50% with a 1% floor) and matures in October 2023. In April 2017, we received $0.9 million remittance from our investment in Gramercy Park CLO Ltd., which we applied to our cost basis. In May 2017, Talos Production, LLC repaid a portion of its senior unsecured notes in the amount of $0.5 million at par. Operating Results Investment income totaled $2.5 million for the second quarter of 2017, decreasing 43.4% compared to $4.4 million in the corresponding quarter of 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a $1.5 million decrease in investment income related to non-accruals assets and a decrease in average portfolio balance. Operating expenses for the second quarter of 2017 were $2.3 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 22.9%, compared to operating expenses for the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in operating expenses is related to lower base management and incentive fees, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses. The resulting net investment income was $0.1 million or $0.01 per share, for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $1.3 million, or $0.06 per share, for the second quarter of 2016. We recorded net realized and unrealized losses on investments totaling $5.0 million, or $0.25 per share, during the second quarter of 2017, compared to $1.1 million, or $0.06 per share, during the second quarter of 2016. Total losses recorded in the second quarter of 2017 was driven primarily by the $4.7 million write-down in Castex, a legacy energy portfolio investment. Overall, we experienced a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $4.9 million, or $0.24 per share, for the second quarter of 2017. After declaring a quarterly dividend during the period of $0.02 per share, our net asset value decreased 8.6%, from $3.02 per share as of March 31, 2017 to $2.76 per share as of June 30, 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources At June 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $12.0 million. The total amount outstanding under our credit facility at June 30, 2017 was $40.5 million with $16.0 million available to draw.

OHAI,"NEW YORK, Jun 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OHA Investment Corporation OHAI, -1.43% (the ""Company"") today announced that its Board of Directors has declared a quarterly distribution of $0.02 per share. Quarterly Distribution Declaration The quarterly distribution in the amount of $0.02 per common share will be paid July 10, 2017 to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2017. Distributions are paid from taxable earnings and may include a return of capital and/or capital gains. The amount of distributable income for each quarter depends on the aggregate gains and losses realized by the Company during the entire year. Distributions may consist of net investment income, capital gains and return of capital, but the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the Company's fiscal year. The specific tax characteristics of distributions paid during calendar 2017 will be reported to each stockholder on Form 1099-DIV after the end of the calendar year. The Board of Directors of the Company has the discretion to change the amount of the distribution in any given quarter based on the Company's estimate, as of that quarter, of its taxable income for the year. The Company's estimate of its taxable income for 2017, and therefore the amount of each quarterly distribution in 2017, may change depending on a variety of factors, including the performance of the Company's portfolio investments. The Company has an ""opt out"" dividend reinvestment plan, or ""DRIP,"" for its stockholders. Consequently, when the Company declares a distribution, stockholders who have not opted out of the DRIP automatically have their distribution reinvested in shares of the Company's stock, rather than receiving it in cash. A stockholder who has elected to receive distributions in cash may re-enroll in the DRIP at any time by notifying the plan administrator.

Management will discuss the Company's results summarized below on a conference call on Tuesday, May 16, 2017, at 1:30 p.m.(Eastern Time). Summary results for the quarter ended March 31, 2017: Total investment income:  $2.5 million, or $0.12 per share Net investment income:  $0.2 million, or $0.01 per share Net realized and unrealized losses:  $19.3 million, or $0.96 per share Net asset value:  $61.0 million, or $3.02 per share New portfolio investments during the quarter:  $9.9 million Fair value of portfolio investments:  $88.7 million Investment in Castex Energy 2005, LP written down by $21.2 million, or $1.05 per share, and placed on non-accrual status during the quarter Portfolio ActivityThe fair value of our investment portfolio was $88.7 million at March 31, 2017, decreasing 15.5% compared to December 31, 2016. During the first quarter of 2017, the Company had realizations totaling $8.5 million and made one new investment in the amount of $9.9 million. The concentration of our investment portfolio in the energy sector at March 31, 2017 was 23%. The current weighted average yield of our portfolio based on the cost and fair value of our yielding investments was 12.5% and 12.8%, respectively, as of March 31, 2017. During the first quarter, we added $7.0 million of second lien term loan in Equinox Holdings, Inc. (""Equinox""), a leading operator of upscale fitness clubs and spas. We initially acquired $10.0 million of Equinox second lien term loan (at price of 99.25), which earns interest payable in cash at a rate of LIBOR+7.0% with a 1% LIBOR floor and matures in September 2024. Subsequently, we sold $3.0 million of the Equinox second lien term loan at an average price of 101.5, resulting in a realized capital gain of $68,000.

In February 2017, Royal Holdings, Inc. repaid part of its second lien term loan in the amount of $4.5 million. We recorded previously unamortized discount of $30,000 and 1% call premium of $45,000 as additional interest income and other investment income, respectively, as a result of this repayment. In March 2017, we sold $0.5 million of the second lien term loan of Berlin Packaging, LLC at a price of 101.0, resulting in a realized capital gain of $23,000. Operating Results Investment income totaled $2.5 million for the first quarter of 2017, decreasing 52.4% compared to $5.2 million in the corresponding quarter of 2016. The decrease was attributable to a decrease in average portfolio investment balance on a cost basis and a decrease in the weighted average yield on our investment portfolio from March 31, 2016 to March 31, 2017. Also during the first quarter of 2017, we placed our investment in the redeemable preferred LP units of Castex Energy 2005, LP (""Castex"") on non-accrual status based on our March 31, 2017 valuation, which reflected a determination that future payments to be received from this investment would no longer be sufficient to cover all of the contractual principal and dividend amounts on this investment. For the first quarter of 2016, Castex dividend income was $1.3 million or 25% of total investment income. Operating expenses for the first quarter of 2017 were $2.3 million, a decrease of $1.0 million, or 31.7%, compared to operating expenses for the first quarter of 2016. The decrease in operating expenses is related to lower base management and incentive fees, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses. The resulting net investment income was $0.2 million or $0.01 per share, for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $1.8 million, or $0.09 per share, for the first quarter of 2016. We recorded net realized and unrealized losses on investments totaling $19.3 million, or $0.96 per share, during the first quarter of 2017, compared to $13.5 million, or $0.67 per share, during the first quarter of 2016. Total losses recorded in the first quarter of 2017 was driven primarily by the $21.2 million write-down in Castex, a legacy energy portfolio investment. Overall, we experienced a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $19.1 million, or $0.95 per share, for the first quarter of 2017. After declaring a quarterly dividend during the period of $0.02 per share, our net asset value decreased 24.3%, from $3.99 per share as of December 31, 2016 to $3.02 per share as of March 31, 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents totaling $9.3 million. The total amount outstanding under our credit facility at March 31, 2017 was $40.5 million with $16.0 available to draw.
