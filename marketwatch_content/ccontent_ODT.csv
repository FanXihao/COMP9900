ODT,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our audited financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, include forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. You should review the ""Risk Factors"" set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview We are a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of best-in-class therapeutics that improve and extend the lives of patients with cancer. Our initial focus is on the development of tesetaxel, an investigational, orally administered chemotherapy agent that belongs to a class of drugs known as taxanes, which are widely used in the treatment of cancer. Tesetaxel has several potential therapeutic advantages over currently available taxanes, including: On December 6, 2017, we converted from a Delaware limited liability company to a Delaware corporation by filing a certificate of conversion with the Delaware Secretary of State, and we changed our name from ""Odonate Therapeutics, LLC"" to ""Odonate Therapeutics, Inc."" (the ""Conversion""). As a result of the Conversion, the membership interests of Odonate Therapeutics, LLC were converted into shares of Odonate Therapeutics, Inc. Prior to the Conversion, we formed a holding company named Odonate Holdings, LLC (""Odonate Holdings"") to own Odonate Therapeutics, LLC. Following the Conversion, Odonate Holdings distributed its interest in Odonate Therapeutics, Inc. to prior members of Odonate Therapeutics, LLC, but retained record title to the 2,931,402 shares of common stock underlying outstanding incentive units previously granted to employees, officers, directors and consultants by Odonate Management Holdings, LLC and 154,285 shares of common stock beneficially owned by Tang Capital Partners, LP. All common stock and per share amounts for all periods presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K have been adjusted retroactively, where applicable, to reflect the Conversion. On December 11, 2017, we closed our initial public offering (""IPO"") of 6,250,000 shares of common stock at a public offering price of $24.00 per share. On January 10, 2018, the underwriters in the IPO purchased 441,073 shares of common stock in connection with the exercise of their option to purchase additional shares of common stock. The aggregate gross proceeds from the IPO were $160.6 million, and the net proceeds were $147.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering costs. Components of Our Results of Operations Research and Development Expense Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the development of our product candidates and include salaries, benefits, travel and other related costs, including equity-based compensation expenses, for personnel engaged in research and development functions; expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations (""CROs""), investigative sites and consultants that conduct our preclinical and clinical studies; manufacturing development and scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical study materials and commercial materials, including manufacturing registration and validation batches; payments to consultants engaged in the development of our product candidates, including equity-based compensation, travel and other expenses; costs related to compliance with quality and regulatory requirements; and research and development facility-related expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses, and other related costs. Research and development expenses are charged to operations as incurred when these expenditures relate to our research and development efforts and have no alternative future uses. Payments made prior to the receipt of goods or services to be used in research and development are capitalized until the goods or services are received. All of our research and development expenses to date have been incurred in connection with tesetaxel. We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we advance tesetaxel through clinical development, including the conduct of our ongoing Phase 3 study, CONTESSA. General and Administrative Expense General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries, related benefits, travel, equity-based compensation expense and facility-related expenses for personnel in finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include professional fees for legal, patent, consulting, accounting and audit services and other related costs. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we build our infrastructure to support our continued research and development of tesetaxel. We also anticipate increased expenses related to accounting, legal and regulatory-related services associated with maintaining compliance with exchange listing and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") requirements, director and officer insurance premiums and other costs associated with being a public company. Results of Operations The following table summarizes our results of operations for each of the periods set forth below: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Operating expenses: Research and development $ 27,902 $ 2,622 General and administrative 4,842 463 Total operating expenses $ 32,744 $ 3,085  Research and Development Expense The following table summarizes our research and development expense for each of the periods set forth below: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Clinical development costs $ 18,129 $ 1,223 Personnel and related costs 6,957 1,295 Equity-based compensation expense 2,633 51 Other research and development costs 183 53 Total research and development expense $ 27,902 $ 2,622  Research and development expense was $27.9 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of $25.3 million was primarily due to increased activities in connection with our tesetaxel clinical development program, including the initiation of CONTESSA, resulting in increased clinical development costs of $16.9 million, increased personnel and related costs of $5.7 million and increased equity-based compensation expense of $2.6 million. General and Administrative Expense The following table summarizes our general and administrative expense for each of the periods set forth below: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) General and administrative costs $ 4,291 $ 463 Equity-based compensation expense 551 - Total general and administrative expense $ 4,842 $ 463  General and administrative expense was $4.9 million and $0.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of $4.4 million was due to increased administrative support costs in connection with our tesetaxel clinical development program, including increased personnel, professional and other general administrative costs of $3.8 million and increased equity-based compensation expense of $0.6 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had cash in the amount of $198.1 million and $2.6 million, respectively. We believe that our existing cash as of December 31, 2017 will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements through at least one year from the date this Annual Report on Form 10-K is filed with the SEC. We have incurred losses in each year since our inception. Our net loss was $32.7 million and $3.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had an accumulated deficit of $39.3 million and $6.5 million, respectively. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred in connection with advancing tesetaxel through development activities and general and administrative costs associated with our operations. To date, we have funded our operations through the sale of equity securities. Since our inception, we have raised $238.1 million in net proceeds from the sale of equity securities. The following table sets forth a summary of the net cash flow activity for each of the periods set forth below:  Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ (25,858 ) $ (1,733 ) Investing activities (83 ) - Financing activities 221,447 4,194 Net increase in cash $ 195,506 $ 2,461  Net cash used in operating activities was $25.9 million and $1.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities was the result of our net loss and change in working capital, partially offset by non-cash contributions for expenses by an affiliate of a significant stockholder, equity-based compensation and depreciation expense. Net cash used in investing activities was $0.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. Net cash used in investing activities was the result of purchases of property and equipment. No cash was used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash provided by financing activities was $221.5 million and $4.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash provided by financing activities was the result of our sale of common stock in our IPO for net proceeds of $137.5 million and, prior to our IPO, our sale of common stock in private financings for net proceeds of $84.0 million. For the year ended December 31, 2016, net cash provided by financing activities was the result of our sale of common stock, net of capital distributions of $0.8 million to our common stockholders. Until such time as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic partnerships and licensing arrangements. To the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interest of our stockholders will be or could be diluted, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect the rights of our common stockholders. Debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If we raise additional funds through collaborations, strategic partnerships or licensing arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our product candidates, associated intellectual property, our other technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when needed, we may be required to delay, limit, reduce or terminate our product development or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market our product candidate even if we would otherwise prefer to develop and market such product candidate ourselves. Contractual Obligations and Commitments We enter into contracts in the normal course of business with CROs, contract development and manufacturing organizations and other service providers and vendors. These contracts generally provide for termination on notice and, therefore, are cancelable contracts and not included in the table of contractual obligations and commitments. In 2013, we licensed rights to tesetaxel in all major markets from Daiichi Sankyo Company, Limited (""Daiichi Sankyo""), the original inventor of the product. Under the Daiichi Sankyo license agreement, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize tesetaxel in the following countries: France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom and the U.S. We are required to make aggregate future milestone payments of up to $31.0 million, contingent on attainment of certain regulatory milestones. Additionally, we will pay Daiichi Sankyo a tiered royalty that ranges from the low to high single digits, depending on annual net sales of tesetaxel. A summary of our contractual obligations and commitments as of December 31, 2017 is set forth below (in thousands):  Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 to 3 3 to 5 More than Amounts 1 Year Years Years 5 Years Committed Milestone payments(1) - - - - $ 31,000  (1) Represents potential aggregate future milestone payment amounts to Daiichi Sankyo. The actual amount and timing of these payments are uncertain, as the payments are contingent on future events. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements During the periods presented, we did not have, nor do we currently have, any off-balance sheet arrangements as defined under the rules of the SEC. Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act We are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (""JOBS Act""). Under this act, emerging growth companies can delay adopting new or revised accounting standards issued subsequent to the enactment of the JOBS Act until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. However, we also intend to rely on other exemptions provided by the JOBS Act, including without limitation, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the U.S. (""GAAP""). The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported expenses during the reporting periods. These items are monitored and analyzed by us for changes in facts and circumstances, and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Changes in estimates are reflected in reported results for the period in which they become known. Actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. While our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our audited financial statements elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies related to accrued expenses and equity-based compensation are most critical to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results. Accrued Expenses As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate our accrued expenses. This process involves reviewing open contracts and purchase orders, communicating with our personnel to identify services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for the service when we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of the actual cost. The majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed or when contractual milestones are met. We make estimates of our accrued expenses as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time. We periodically confirm the accuracy of our estimates with the service providers and make adjustments if necessary. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include costs associated with conducting our development and regulatory activities, including fees paid to third-party professional consultants and service providers, and costs to develop and manufacture clinical study materials. We base our accrued expenses on our estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to our contractual arrangements. The financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation, vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows. There may be instances in which payments made to our service providers will exceed the level of services provided and result in a prepayment of the expense. In accruing service fees, we estimate the time period over which services will be performed and the level of effort to be expended in each period. If the actual timing of the performance of services or the level of effort varies from our estimate, we adjust the accrual or prepayment accordingly. Although we do not expect our estimates to be materially different from amounts actually incurred, if our estimates of the status and timing of services performed differs from the actual status and timing of services performed, we may report amounts that are too high or too low in any particular period. To date, there have been no material differences from our estimates to the amount actually incurred. Equity-based Compensation Equity-based compensation expense represents the grant-date fair value of employee awards recognized over the requisite service period of the awards (usually the vesting period) on a straight-line basis. We account for awards to non-employees using the fair value approach. Non-employee awards are subject to periodic revaluation over their vesting terms. Following the Conversion, we adopted the Odonate Therapeutics, Inc. 2017 Stock Option Plan (the ""2017 Plan"") in order to grant stock options to our employees, officers, directors and consultants. Recipients of stock options are eligible to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of such stock on the date of grant. The maximum term of options granted under the 2017 Plan is 10 years. The options generally vest over a 4-year period from either the date of grant or the commencement of service. Following the Conversion, we adopted the Odonate Therapeutics, Inc. 2017 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ""ESPP"") in order to provide a means for eligible employees to accumulate shares of our common stock over time through regular payroll deductions. Under the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase shares of our common stock twice per month at a price equal to 85% of the closing price of our common stock on the date of each purchase. Eligible employees purchasing shares under the ESPP are subject to an annual cap equal to the lesser of $25,000 or 10% of the employee's annual cash compensation. Shares purchased under the ESPP cannot be sold for a period of one year following the purchase date (or such shorter period of time if the participating employee's employment terminates before this one-year anniversary). Enrollment under the ESPP had not commenced as of December 31, 2017. Prior to the Conversion, we, through Odonate Management Holdings, LLC (""Management Holdings""), issued an aggregate of 2,931,402 incentive units under the Odonate Management Holdings Equity Incentive Plan (the ""Management Plan""). The incentive units were issued to certain of our directors, officers, employees and consultants in consideration for bona fide services provided to us. Pursuant to the Management Plan, the incentive units are considered ""profits interests"" within the meaning of U.S. federal and state tax rules. Incentive units do not entitle their holders to receive distributions if we were to be liquidated immediately after the grant. Instead, the incentive unitholders are entitled to receive an allocation of a portion of our profits arising after the date of the grant and, subject to vesting conditions, distributions made out of a portion of our profits arising after the grant date of the incentive units. Accordingly, the financial benefits of incentive units to the awardee, and the costs to the issuing company, are substantially similar to a stock option grant. All incentive units generally vest over a 4-year period from either the date of grant or the commencement of service. Following the Conversion, we have not granted, and will no longer grant, incentive units under the Management Plan. Following the Conversion, the outstanding incentive units of Management Holdings remain outstanding, but represent an indirect interest in the common stock of the Company on vesting of the awards. As part of the Conversion, the shares of common stock underlying the outstanding incentive units were issued to a newly formed entity, Odonate Holdings, LLC (""Odonate Holdings""). While Odonate Holdings holds the shares of common stock underlying outstanding incentive units, it has no other operations. In addition, Odonate Holdings granted us an irrevocable proxy directing us to vote all shares of common stock underlying outstanding incentive units held by Odonate Holdings in the same proportion as the votes cast by all other stockholders, which is sometimes called ""mirrored voting."" In the event that any incentive units in Management Holdings are forfeited, the shares of common stock underlying such forfeited incentive units will be transferred from Odonate Holdings to us and cancelled. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, there were 2,931,402 and 1,934,716 incentive units outstanding, respectively, all of which are incentive units in Odonate Holdings and represent an indirect right, subject to vesting, in our common stock. As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had 183,699 and 0 stock options outstanding, respectively. The grant-date fair value of equity awards was estimated using a Black-Scholes option-pricing model. We used a volatility and risk-free rate of 73% to 79% and 1.3% to 2.5%, respectively, to estimate the fair value of the equity awards. The estimated volatility was based on the historical equity volatility of comparable companies. Prior to our IPO, there was no public market for our common stock and incentive units at the time of grant. As such, the fair value of the common stock and incentive units were estimated on each grant date by our management. In order to determine the fair value of our common stock and incentive units, our management considered, among other things, recently available independent valuations and valuations derived from the sale of our equity securities to third parties in recent equity financings. These independent valuations were performed in accordance with the guidance outlined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Accounting and Valuation Guide, Valuation of Privately-Held-Company Equity Securities Issued as Compensation. Following the closing of our IPO, we determine the fair value of our common stock based on the closing price of our common stock as reported on the Nasdaq Global Select Market.

ODT, -2.12% a pharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of best-in-class therapeutics that improve and extend the lives of patients with cancer, today announced financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, Odonate had $198.1 million in cash, compared to $2.6 million as of December 31, 2016. This increase in cash resulted from net proceeds from common stock offerings of $221.4 million, less net cash used in operating activities of $25.9 million. Odonate’s net loss for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 was $15.7 million and $32.7 million, or $0.81 per share and $2.31 per share, respectively, compared to $1.9 million and $3.1 million, or $0.19 per share and $0.54 per share, respectively, for the same periods in 2016. “We are excited to have recently initiated CONTESSA, our Phase 3 study investigating tesetaxel in the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer,” said Kevin Tang, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Odonate. “Despite recent advances in the treatment of advanced breast cancer, there remains a significant need for new therapies that allow patients to maintain a better quality of life. We are hopeful that tesetaxel’s oral bioavailability, low pill burden, lack of history of hypersensitivity reactions and robust activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumors seen in prior studies may translate into significant benefits for patients.” About Tesetaxel Tesetaxel is an investigational, orally administered chemotherapy agent that belongs to a class of drugs known as taxanes, which are widely used in the treatment of cancer. Tesetaxel has several potential therapeutic advantages over currently available taxanes, including: oral administration with a low pill burden and a patient-friendly dosing regimen; no history of hypersensitivity (allergic) reactions; and robust activity against chemotherapy-resistant tumors. More than 500 patients have been treated with tesetaxel across 22 clinical studies. In patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC), tesetaxel was shown to have robust single-agent antitumor activity in two, multicenter, Phase 2 studies. About CONTESSA CONTESSA is a multinational, multicenter, randomized, Phase 3 study of tesetaxel, an investigational, orally administered taxane, in patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer (MBC). CONTESSA will compare tesetaxel dosed orally at 27 mg/m [2] on the first day of a 21-day cycle plus a reduced dose of capecitabine (1,650 mg/m [2] /day dosed orally on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle) to the approved dose of capecitabine alone () [2] /day dosed orally on days 1-14 of a 21-day cycle) in approximately 600 patients randomized 1:1 with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, hormone receptor (HR) positive MBC previously treated with a taxane in the neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. Capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy agent that is considered a standard-of-care treatment in MBC. Where indicated, patients must have received endocrine therapy with or without a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival (PFS) assessed by an Independent Radiologic Review Committee (IRC). CONTESSA’s secondary efficacy endpoints are overall survival, objective response rate (ORR) assessed by IRC, disease control rate assessed by IRC and patient-reported outcomes.
