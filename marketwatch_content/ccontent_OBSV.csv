OBSV,"AbbVie Inc. ABBV, -2.19% and Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. NBIX, -6.13% shares rose 1.7% and 1.1% respectively in premarket trade Wednesday after the companies announced that their drug met its primary endpoint in a phase 3 trial testing it in women with uterine fibroids. The therapy, elagolix, combined with low-dose hormone therapy reduced heavy menstrual bleeding in 68.5% of women, compared with 8.7% of women on the placebo. The phase 3 trial, ELARIS UF-I, is the first of two late-stage studies, and the Wednesday release was based on topline results from a six-month primary analysis. Uterine fibroids affect an estimated 7.5 million U.S. women, and consist of growths in the uterus that can cause heavy bleeding, pain and bladder problems. Other companies are also developing drugs in this area, includingMyovant MYOV, -5.67% Allergan AGN, -1.72% and the biotech ObsEva OBSV, -2.26% AbbVie and Neurocrine's elagolix is also being developed for endometriosis with associated pain, and is being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration for that indication. AbbVie shares have surged 24.6% over the last three months, and Neurocrine shares have surged 14%, compared with a 4.5% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, -1.19%","Feb 21, 2018 8:34 a.m. ET",1,"AbbVie, Neurocrine shares rise after positive results for uterine fibroids drug",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/abbvie-neurocrine-shares-rise-after-positive-results-for-uterine-fibroids-drug-2018-02-21-8913419
OBSV,"If successful, a new drug from the biotech Myovant Sciences Ltd. could treat two women’s health disorders, as well as prostate cancer. The drug, Relugolix, works to reduce estrogen in women and testosterone in men. The hormones are factors in two painful conditions affecting women, uterine fibroids and endometriosis, and in prostate cancer. Treating those conditions with a hormone-blocking medication is not completely new — AbbVie Inc.’s ABBV, -2.16% Lupron Depot, for example, already does it. But that drug has to be injected, has safety issues and is not supposed to be used in the long term, said Leerink Partners analyst Jason Gerberry. The uterine fibroids and endometriosis markets are “both large, but there are no effective, well tolerated oral therapies” for them, he said. Myovant’s MYOV, -5.67%  drug, which is taken orally once a day, has a different mechanism than Lupron Depot, which the company said allows it to work faster and better than competitors. And when it comes to uterine fibroids and endometriosis, Relugolix also aims to curb side effects like hot flashes and bone loss by incorporating low-dose hormone replacement in the medication. (Lupron is taken with a separate add-back therapy.) In prostate cancer, the drug lacks that aspect and comes in a higher dose, working to suppress the testosterone that drives the disease. Related: Cancer vaccines, long considered failures, are hot again Relugolix is currently in late-stage clinical trials, with results expected in 2019. The drug had positive results in a late-stage clinical trial for uterine fibroids done by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. 4502, -1.52%  and released in October; Takeda is releasing results from another late-stage trial in pain by the end of the year. Myovant was formed last year by privately held Roivant Sciences Ltd. and Takeda, which licensed Relugolix to the biotech. Chief Executive Lynn Seely, a rare female CEO in biotech, told MarketWatch that her goal is to make the company a global leader in women’s health. An endocrinologist who worked in academia early in her career, Seely led the development of prostate cancer drug Xtandi at Medivation (the drug is now owned by Pfizer Inc. PFE, +0.30% ). When she took Myovant public, Seely recalled speaking “to rooms and rooms of male investors.” Uterine fibroids and endometriosis, which affect an estimated 7.5 million and 19 million U.S. women respectively, are “hugely common, but nobody is talking about them,” Seely told MarketWatch. In these disease areas, “the lack of development is shocking.” Myovant Myovant Chief Executive Lynn Seely said her goal is to make the company a global leader in women’s health. The two are different diseases, but both typically affect pre-menopausal women and are driven by estrogen, Seely said. In individuals with endometriosis, tissue that is supposed to grow inside the uterus grows elsewhere. When tissue sheds during the menstrual cycle, it is unable to exit the body, causing irritation and pain. Uterine fibroids are growths in the uterus that can cause pain, heavy bleeding and bladder problems. Myovant Myovant’s Relugolix works to reduce estrogen in women and testosterone in men. The hormones drive uterine fibroids and endometriosis in women and prostate cancer in men, the company said. Besides Lupron Depot, the only other medications for the diseases are oral contraceptives and pain medications, but none work particularly well as a long-term option. See: This is what happens when women can’t afford birth control and Trump’s new rule marks end of affordable birth control — this is how much the Obama-era rule saved American women That may be changing. On Tuesday, Allergan PLC AGN, -1.68%  said that the Food and Drug Administration is considering its drug for uterine fibroid-related bleeding, with an approval decision expected in the first half of 2018. AbbVie Inc. ABBV, -2.16%  submitted an application with the FDA last month for its drug with Neurocrine Biosciences Inc. NBIX, -6.14%  that is intended to manage endometriosis with associated pain. Read: AbbVie expects to bring endometriosis drug to FDA in 2017 And the biotech ObsEva OBSV, -2.26%  is also developing a treatment for uterine fibroids and endometriosis, though the medication may only be available at the end of 2021. Though ObsEva’s OBE2109 is behind competitors, Leerink’s Gerberry said he’s hopeful that the drug will distinguish itself. 3D-Printed Hair System Helps Cancer Survivor Move On “While the competitive pipeline of treatments in development for [uterine fibroids/endometriosis] is deep, we believe OBE2109 may possess the best in class profile,” he said earlier this year. But Seely said she’s confident in Relugolix, and that having options for women is “tremendous.” To her, success means “women have the option to take our pill instead of undergoing invasive procedures” and dealing with painful symptoms, she said. “The goal is she feels well enough to go about her daily business.” Myovant shares have surged 35.2% over the last three months, compared with a 5.2% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, -1.15% More from MarketWatch Don’t ever do this with your credit card S&P 500 logs longest losing streak of the year as trade-war jitters weigh Trump boasts about making up facts about trade deficit to Trudeau","Oct 16, 2017 7:39 a.m. ET",4,This drug may be able to treat both women’s health disorders and prostate cancer,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/this-drug-may-have-a-shot-at-both-womens-health-disorders-and-prostate-cancer-2017-10-11

""We look forward to delivering on our strategic, clinical and regulatory milestones for all three of our development compounds over the course of 2018"". Recent Pipeline Highlights - Randomization of 778 patients was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the Phase 3 IMPLANT 2 trial of nolasiban, ObsEva's oral oxytocin receptor antagonist given as a single dose, 4 hours prior to a single ET and designed to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Positive top line results disclosed in February 2018 showed the primary endpoint was achieved, with a 10-week ongoing pregnancy rate of 35.6% for nolasiban treated patients vs. 28.5% for placebo treated patients, a 25% relative increase (p= 0.031). In the embryo transfer (ET) D5 subgroup, the relative increase was 32% and the absolute increase was 11.2% in favor of nolasiban (nolasiban 45.9% and placebo 34.7%, p = 0.034). In addition, nolasiban treatment was safe and well tolerated with no difference in rates of discontinuation from treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE's) nor the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE's) as compared to placebo. - U.S. patient recruitment was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the EDELWEISS Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109, ObsEva's oral GnRH receptor antagonist for the treatment of endometriosis. Enrollment in the trial of approximately 330 patients combined in Europe and the U.S. is now complete, and the patient treatment and follow-up portion of the trial is ongoing. - Patient enrollment continued in the PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 Phase 3 clinical trials of OBE2109 for the treatment of uterine fibroids, with a target enrollment of approximately 1,000 women in total (US and Europe). - The PROLONG Phase 2a clinical trial of OBE022, ObsEva's oral prostaglandin F2 alpha receptor antagonist for the treatment of pre-term labor in pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation, was initiated in December, 2017. Upcoming Milestones ObsEva expects to achieve the following clinical and regulatory milestones during 2018: - 12 week results from the Phase 2b EDELWEISS clinical trial of OBE2109 for the treatment of endometriosis, in mid-2018. End-of-phase 2 meeting with regulatory authorities to discuss the design of the phase 3 program for that indication is expected by the end of 2018. - Completion of patient recruitment in the Phase 3 PRIMROSE 1 and 2 trials of OBE2109 for the treatment of uterine fibroids by the end of 2018. - Results of live birth rates and 28-day neonatal safety from the Phase 3 IMPLANT2 clinical trial of nolasiban in IVF in the fourth quarter of 2018. Post consultation with regulatory authorities, initiation of US Phase 3 clinical development program is expected by the end of 2018. - Initial efficacy results from the Phase 2a PROLONG clinical trial of OBE022 in pre-term labor in late 2018.

Pipeline Achievements in 2017 Included Progress with Three Phase 3 and Two Phase 2 Clinical Trials -Key 2018 Clinical Milestones Anticipated for All Three Development Compounds - Lead Compound OBE2109 Endometriosis Phase 2b EDELWEISS trial results mid-2018, and Phase 3 Uterine Fibroid trial enrollment completion 4Q:18 - Nolasiban IVF Phase 3 IMPLANT2 trial results for Live Birth Rate 4Q:18 - Initial efficacy results from Phase 2a PROLONG trial of OBE022 in pre-term labor late 2018 Geneva, Switzerland and Boston, MA - March 9, 2017 - ObsEva SA OBSV, -2.26% a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman's reproductive health and pregnancy, today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31,2017, and provided a business update outlining recent corporate progress and upcoming milestones. ""2017 was a very important year for ObsEva as we became a public company, focused on designing, initiating, and enrolling clinical trials within our four ongoing development programs seeking to bring new treatment alternatives to women in need"" said Ernest Loumaye, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of ObsEva. ""We look forward to delivering on our strategic, clinical and regulatory milestones for all three of our development compounds over the course of 2018"". Recent Pipeline Highlights - Randomization of 778 patients was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the Phase 3 IMPLANT 2 trial of nolasiban, ObsEva's oral oxytocin receptor antagonist given as a single dose, 4 hours prior to a single ET and designed to improve clinical pregnancy and live birth rates in women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Positive top line results disclosed in February 2018 showed the primary endpoint was achieved, with a 10-week ongoing pregnancy rate of 35.6% for nolasiban treated patients vs. 28.5% for placebo treated patients, a 25% relative increase (p= 0.031). In the embryo transfer (ET) D5 subgroup, the relative increase was 32% and the absolute increase was 11.2% in favor of nolasiban (nolasiban 45.9% and placebo 34.7%, p = 0.034). In addition, nolasiban treatment was safe and well tolerated with no difference in rates of discontinuation from treatment emergent adverse events (TEAE's) nor the incidence of serious adverse events (SAE's) as compared to placebo. - U.S. patient recruitment was completed in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the EDELWEISS Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109, ObsEva's oral GnRH receptor antagonist for the treatment of endometriosis. Enrollment in the trial of approximately 330 patients combined in Europe and the U.S. is now complete, and the patient treatment and follow-up portion of the trial is ongoing. - Patient enrollment continued in the PRIMROSE 1 and PRIMROSE 2 Phase 3 clinical trials of OBE2109 for the treatment of uterine fibroids, with a target enrollment of approximately 1,000 women in total (US and Europe). - The PROLONG Phase 2a clinical trial of OBE022, ObsEva's oral prostaglandin F2 alpha receptor antagonist for the treatment of pre-term labor in pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks of gestation, was initiated in December, 2017. Upcoming Milestones ObsEva expects to achieve the following clinical and regulatory milestones during 2018: - 12 week results from the Phase 2b EDELWEISS clinical trial of OBE2109 for the treatment of endometriosis, in mid-2018. End-of-phase 2 meeting with regulatory authorities to discuss the design of the phase 3 program for that indication is expected by the end of 2018. - Completion of patient recruitment in the Phase 3 PRIMROSE 1 and 2 trials of OBE2109 for the treatment of uterine fibroids by the end of 2018. - Results of live birth rates and 28-day neonatal safety from the Phase 3 IMPLANT2 clinical trial of nolasiban in IVF in the fourth quarter of 2018. Post consultation with regulatory authorities, initiation of US Phase 3 clinical development program is expected by the end of 2018. - Initial efficacy results from the Phase 2a PROLONG clinical trial of OBE022 in pre-term labor in late 2018. Fourth Quarter and Year-End 2017 Financial Results Net loss for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $17.1 million, or ($0.48) per basic and diluted share, vs. $11.1 million or ($0.51) per basic and diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2016. Research and development expenses were $13.9 million and general and administrative expenses were $3.0 million for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, vs. $8.2 million and $3.1 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2016. For the full year 2017, the net loss was $66.9 million, or ($2.25) per basic and diluted share, vs. $30.2 million, or ($1.40) per basic and diluted share for the year 2016. The net loss in these periods was largely driven by research and development expense, which totaled $54.9 million in 2017, vs. $23.7 million in 2016. As of December 31, 2017, ObsEva had cash and cash equivalents of $110.8 million, which includes net proceeds of approximately $56.3 million raised in the private equity financing that was announced on October 10, 2017.

OBSV,"Feb 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The WHO considers infertility a global public health issue affecting 186 million people, and only 1 in 4 ART treatments results in childbirth Geneva, Switzerland and Boston, MA - 26 February, 2018 - ObsEva SA OBSV, -2.26% a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman's reproductive health and pregnancy, today reported positive top line results of the IMPLANT2 Phase 3 clinical trial of its oral oxytocin receptor antagonist, nolasiban, which is being developed for improving pregnancy rate following in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection (IVF/ICSI) procedures. Importantly, infertility impacts approximately 10% of reproductive aged couples, and is influenced by the trend of pregnancy desired later in reproductive lives, with annual assisted reproduction technology (ART) cycles approximating 1.6 million worldwide. IMPLANT2 is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial that included 778 patients from 41 fertility clinics across 9 European countries. Patients received either a single 900 mg dose of nolasiban or placebo (1:1) orally on the day of embryo transfer (ET). Recruitment included patients undergoing single, fresh ET on day 3 (D3, n=388) or on day 5 (D5, n=390) after oocyte retrieval. The primary endpoint of the trial was ongoing pregnancy as determined by ultrasound at 10 weeks following ET. The pre-defined primary analysis was conducted on the pooled population of D3 and D5 ET. These top line results include efficacy and safety data up to week 10 of pregnancy following embryo transfer. Demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The primary endpoint of the clinical trial was met, with an absolute increase in ongoing pregnancy rate at 10 weeks of 7.1% (placebo 28.5% and nolasiban 35.6%, p = 0.031). This represents a relative increase of 25% in the ongoing pregnancy rate after administration of nolasiban compared to placebo. In the ET D5 subgroup, the absolute increase was 11.2% in favor of nolasiban (placebo 34.7% and nolasiban 45.9%, p = 0.034). This represents a relative increase in ongoing pregnancy rate of 32% after administration of nolasiban compared to placebo. In the ET D3 subgroup, there was a statistically non-significant 3.1% absolute increase in favor of nolasiban (placebo 22.2% and nolasiban 25.3%, p > 0.05), or a 14.0% relative increase in ongoing pregnancy rate after administration of nolasiban compared to placebo. In addition, nolasiban was well tolerated, with low rates of treatment discontinuation that were comparable between treatment and placebo. The safety profile of nolasiban was also similar to placebo, with a total of 9 (2.3%) serious adverse events (SAE's) in the placebo group and 4 (1.0%) in the nolasiban group. None of these SAE's were reported to be related to treatment. Professor Herman Tournaye, MD, PhD, Head of the Centre for Reproductive Medicine at University Hospital Brussels, and Principal Investigator of the IMPLANT2 study commented, ""As the global IVF standard of care moves to Day 5 embryo transfer, the IMPLANT2 results are highly relevant in that an approximate 30% increase in ongoing clinical pregnancy would constitute a major step forward in the field"". Follow-up data from the IMPLANT2 study will include live birth rate, and 28-day neonatal safety, expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. Six-month infant follow-up is expected to be available in 2019. ""We are very pleased that the IMPLANT2 results reported today demonstrate an ongoing pregnancy benefit at 10 weeks following a single, oral dose of nolasiban, given 4 hours prior to a single ET, that not only was statistically significant, but the magnitude of which we believe represents a highly clinically meaningful improvement for the women undergoing IVF/ICSI procedures"" said Ernest Loumaye, MD, PhD, OB/GYN, CEO and Co-Founder of ObsEva. ""We believe IMPLANT2 results potentially represent one of the most important innovations in the practice of IVF/ICSI since the emergence of recombinant FSH more than 20 years ago"". Based upon the data, ObsEva intends to seek feedback from regulatory authorities in Europe and the United States on any necessary additional clinical requirements, and also solicit guidance on the regulatory registration path forward. ObsEva plans to provide an update on its expected nolasiban clinical and regulatory timelines following these discussions. Conference Call Information ObsEva will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss IMPLANT2 results and review the company's strategic development plans. To participate in the conference call, please dial +1(844)-419-1772 (domestic) or +1(213) 660-0921 (international) and refer to conference ID 9784807. The webcast can be accessed under the ""Investors"" section of ObsEva's website www.obseva.com About the IMPLANT2 Clinical Trial IMPLANT2 is a Phase 3, randomized, double blind, clinical trial assessing nolasiban compared to placebo for improving the rate of pregnancy in patients undergoing IVF or ICSI due to low fertility. Following ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval and fertilization, eligible women are randomized to receive either a single, oral dose of 900 mg nolasiban or placebo 4 hours before D3 or D5 fresh, single ET. The primary endpoint is ongoing pregnancy at 10 weeks after ET. Women with confirmed pregnancies are monitored until delivery and the infants for up to 6 months following birth. About Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Infertility affects about 10 percent of reproductive-aged couples, with approximately 1.6 million ART treatments (including IVF and ICSI) performed worldwide each year. Currently 59% of fresh embryo transfers are performed on D5 and 31% on D3 in the United States (CDC report, 2015 data). While the success of ART depends on multiple factors such as embryo quality and ET procedure, a successful pregnancy ultimately hinges on the receptivity of the uterus to accept embryo implantation. Uterine contractions at the time of ET, as well as suboptimal thickness of the uterine wall and blood flow to the uterus, may impair the implantation of the embryo. About Nolasiban Nolasiban (previously known as OBE001), is an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist with the potential to decrease uterine contractions, improve uterine blood flow and enhance the receptivity of the endometrium to embryo implantation, all of which may increase the chance of successful pregnancy and live-birth among patients undergoing ART. ObsEva licensed nolasiban from Merck-Serono in 2013 and retains worldwide, exclusive, commercial rights. About ObsEva ObsEva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the clinical development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman's reproductive health and pregnancy. Through strategic in-licensing and disciplined drug development, ObsEva has established a late-stage clinical pipeline with development programs focused on treating endometriosis, uterine fibroids, preterm labor and improving ART (IVF/ICSI) outcomes.

Importantly, infertility impacts approximately 10% of reproductive aged couples, and is influenced by the trend of pregnancy desired later in reproductive lives, with annual assisted reproduction technology (ART) cycles approximating 1.6 million worldwide. IMPLANT2 is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled clinical trial that included 778 patients from 41 fertility clinics across 9 European countries. Patients received either a single 900 mg dose of nolasiban or placebo (1:1) orally on the day of embryo transfer (ET). Recruitment included patients undergoing single, fresh ET on day 3 (D3, n=388) or on day 5 (D5, n=390) after oocyte retrieval. The primary endpoint of the trial was ongoing pregnancy as determined by ultrasound at 10 weeks following ET. The pre-defined primary analysis was conducted on the pooled population of D3 and D5 ET. These top line results include efficacy and safety data up to week 10 of pregnancy following embryo transfer. Demographics and baseline characteristics were comparable between groups. The primary endpoint of the clinical trial was met, with an absolute increase in ongoing pregnancy rate at 10 weeks of 7.1% (placebo 28.5% and nolasiban 35.6%, p = 0.031). This represents a relative increase of 25% in the ongoing pregnancy rate after administration of nolasiban compared to placebo. In the ET D5 subgroup, the absolute increase was 11.2% in favor of nolasiban (placebo 34.7% and nolasiban 45.9%, p = 0.034). This represents a relative increase in ongoing pregnancy rate of 32% after administration of nolasiban compared to placebo. In the ET D3 subgroup, there was a statistically non-significant 3.1% absolute increase in favor of nolasiban (placebo 22.2% and nolasiban 25.3%, p > 0.05), or a 14.0% relative increase in ongoing pregnancy rate after administration of nolasiban compared to placebo. In addition, nolasiban was well tolerated, with low rates of treatment discontinuation that were comparable between treatment and placebo. The safety profile of nolasiban was also similar to placebo, with a total of 9 (2.3%) serious adverse events (SAE's) in the placebo group and 4 (1.0%) in the nolasiban group. None of these SAE's were reported to be related to treatment. Professor Herman Tournaye, MD, PhD, Head of the Centre for Reproductive Medicine at University Hospital Brussels, and Principal Investigator of the IMPLANT2 study commented, ""As the global IVF standard of care moves to Day 5 embryo transfer, the IMPLANT2 results are highly relevant in that an approximate 30% increase in ongoing clinical pregnancy would constitute a major step forward in the field"". Follow-up data from the IMPLANT2 study will include live birth rate, and 28-day neonatal safety, expected to be reported in the fourth quarter of 2018. Six-month infant follow-up is expected to be available in 2019. ""We are very pleased that the IMPLANT2 results reported today demonstrate an ongoing pregnancy benefit at 10 weeks following a single, oral dose of nolasiban, given 4 hours prior to a single ET, that not only was statistically significant, but the magnitude of which we believe represents a highly clinically meaningful improvement for the women undergoing IVF/ICSI procedures"" said Ernest Loumaye, MD, PhD, OB/GYN, CEO and Co-Founder of ObsEva. ""We believe IMPLANT2 results potentially represent one of the most important innovations in the practice of IVF/ICSI since the emergence of recombinant FSH more than 20 years ago"". Based upon the data, ObsEva intends to seek feedback from regulatory authorities in Europe and the United States on any necessary additional clinical requirements, and also solicit guidance on the regulatory registration path forward. ObsEva plans to provide an update on its expected nolasiban clinical and regulatory timelines following these discussions. Conference Call Information ObsEva will host a conference call and audio webcast today at 8:00 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss IMPLANT2 results and review the company's strategic development plans. To participate in the conference call, please dial +1(844)-419-1772 (domestic) or +1(213) 660-0921 (international) and refer to conference ID 9784807. The webcast can be accessed under the ""Investors"" section of ObsEva's website www.obseva.com About the IMPLANT2 Clinical Trial IMPLANT2 is a Phase 3, randomized, double blind, clinical trial assessing nolasiban compared to placebo for improving the rate of pregnancy in patients undergoing IVF or ICSI due to low fertility. Following ovarian stimulation, egg retrieval and fertilization, eligible women are randomized to receive either a single, oral dose of 900 mg nolasiban or placebo 4 hours before D3 or D5 fresh, single ET. The primary endpoint is ongoing pregnancy at 10 weeks after ET. Women with confirmed pregnancies are monitored until delivery and the infants for up to 6 months following birth. About Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) Infertility affects about 10 percent of reproductive-aged couples, with approximately 1.6 million ART treatments (including IVF and ICSI) performed worldwide each year. Currently 59% of fresh embryo transfers are performed on D5 and 31% on D3 in the United States (CDC report, 2015 data). While the success of ART depends on multiple factors such as embryo quality and ET procedure, a successful pregnancy ultimately hinges on the receptivity of the uterus to accept embryo implantation. Uterine contractions at the time of ET, as well as suboptimal thickness of the uterine wall and blood flow to the uterus, may impair the implantation of the embryo. About Nolasiban Nolasiban (previously known as OBE001), is an oral oxytocin receptor antagonist with the potential to decrease uterine contractions, improve uterine blood flow and enhance the receptivity of the endometrium to embryo implantation, all of which may increase the chance of successful pregnancy and live-birth among patients undergoing ART. ObsEva licensed nolasiban from Merck-Serono in 2013 and retains worldwide, exclusive, commercial rights. About ObsEva ObsEva is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the clinical development and commercialization of novel therapeutics for serious conditions that compromise a woman's reproductive health and pregnancy. Through strategic in-licensing and disciplined drug development, ObsEva has established a late-stage clinical pipeline with development programs focused on treating endometriosis, uterine fibroids, preterm labor and improving ART (IVF/ICSI) outcomes.
