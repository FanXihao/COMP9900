OESX,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Promoting innovation in clean energy and other industries will help the U.S. grow its economy and create jobs, President Barack Obama said Saturday, ahead of a planned visit to energy labs in Pennsylvania next week. ECONOMY AND POLITICS | @MKTWEconomics  AFP/Getty Images A city-by-city look at home prices in May Tampa, Charlotte among gainers. • U.S. homeownership at 18-year low  Echoing themes from his Tuesday State of the Union address, Obama said the U.S. must out-innovate, out-educate and out-build its global competitors. In his regular Saturday address, he reiterated a goal for 80% of the United States’ electricity to come from renewable sources by 2035. Watch the video of Obama's address on the White House web site. “We need to ensure that we are promoting innovation — especially in promising areas like clean energy,” Obama said in a message recorded at Orion Energy Systems OESX, -2.34%   in Manitowoc, Wis. Obama visited the company earlier this week. In his State of the Union address, Obama said he wants U.S. government investment in clean energy to be paid for by taking away oil companies’ subsidies. The American Petroleum Institute, an oil-and-gas trade group, instantly slammed the president’s proposal. Read story about State of the Union speech. Obama is due to visit Pennsylvania State University on Wednesday, and tour labs focused on energy-efficient building technologies. He’ll deliver a speech about investing in innovation and clean energy while at the university, the White House said. Obama’s call for new spending was met with a chilly response from Republicans on Tuesday night, and the party kept up its opposition on Saturday in its response to Obama’s address. Marc Faber: Stimulus Programs Not Over “The president often speaks of making investments in our economy,” said Sen. Ron Johnson, a freshman Republican from Wisconsin. “If he means allowing taxpayers and businesses to keep more of their hard earned dollars, and providing them the freedom to invest where they choose, I’m all for it. Unfortunately, I’m afraid he means more government spending and more government control.” Watch the Republican address.

Overview our fiscal second quarter ends on September 30, our fiscal third quarter ends on December 31 and our fiscal fourth quarter ends on March 31. Improving LED product performance and reducing customer return on investment payback periods resulting in increased customer preference for LED lighting products compared to legacy lighting products. Increasing LED lighting product customer sales compared to decreasing HIF product sales. A broader and more diverse customer base and market opportunities compared to our historical commercial and industrial facility customers. Increased importance of highly innovative product designs and features and enhanced product research and development capabilities requiring rapid new product introduction and new methods of product and company differentiation. Significantly reduced product technology life cycles; significantly shorter product inventory shelf lives and the related increased risk of rapidly occurring product technology obsolescence. Increased reliance on international component sources. Less internal product fabrication and production capabilities needed to support LED product assembly. Different and broader types of components, fabrication and assembly processes needed to support LED product assembly compared to our legacy products. Expanding customer bases and sales channels. Significantly longer end user product warranty requirements for LED products compared to our legacy products. As we continue to focus our primary business on selling our LED product lines to respond to the rapidly changing market dynamics in the lighting industry, we face intense competition from an increased number of other LED product companies, a number of which have substantially greater resources and more experience and history with LED lighting products than we do. Management Restructuring and Focus on Profitability On May 25, 2017, our Board of Directors restructured our management team. As part of this restructuring, our Chief Executive Officer, John Scribante, left our Company and Mike Altschaefl, our current Board Chair, assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Scott Green, our Executive Vice President, became our new Chief Operating Officer, with ongoing primary responsibility for improving our revenue generation. Mike Potts and Marc Meade, our then current Executive Vice Presidents, remained in their positions and were assigned primary responsibility for substantially reducing our cost structure and for streamlining operations. Bill Hull remained in his position as Chief Financial Officer. Reducing staff positions through a targeted reduction in existing headcount; Reductions in the total compensation of our executive management and board of directors; Reductions in operating expenses, including better control of legal spending, elimination of our racing program and removal of various non-critical back office programs and initiatives. We believe the above cost reduction plan, including the impact of fourth quarter fiscal 2018 actions, will result in annualized cost savings of approximately $6.0 million. These cost reductions, coupled with our renewed focus on sales channel execution, will help to drive revenue growth and accelerate our path to profitability.

(iv) recent and planned new product introductions; and (v) our efforts to improve our gross margin as a result of focused inventory management, our cost containment initiatives and the development of higher-performance LED products. Our long-term optimism is based upon the factors below which we believe will directly or indirectly drive customer spending on LED lighting systems or will improve the profitability of our operations: The continued development of our new higher margin products and product enhancements, including our new LED product offerings; Our efforts to expand our channels of distribution; Our cost reduction initiatives which have included significant changes to our manufacturing operations to increase our flexibility and lower our cost structure; LED adoption continues to grow in all sectors; Commercial and industrial economic sentiment is strengthening; Utility incentives continue to be available and are increasing as a percent of project costs in many areas; The passage of tax regulatory reform could encourage capital spending; Capital spending is increasing; Business profits are increasing; and Consumer spending remains strong. Beyond the benefits of our lighting fixtures, we believe that there is also an opportunity to utilize our system platform as a ""digital"" or ""connected ceiling"", or a framework or network that can support the installation and integration of other business solutions on our digital platform. This anticipated growth opportunity is also known as the ""Industrial Internet of Things"" or IoT, and is still early in its development; however, we have already participated in a few compelling applications that deliver cost savings and efficiency in areas outside of lighting.

Orion U.S. Markets Division The USM segment sells commercial lighting systems and energy management systems to the wholesale contractor markets. USM customers include ESCOs and electrical contractors. A significant portion of the historic sales of this division have migrated to distribution channel sales as a result of the implementation of our agent distribution strategy. The migrated sales are included in our ODS segment. The following table summarizes our USM segment operating results (dollars in thousands): For the Three Months Ended December 31, % 2017 2016 Change Revenues $ 2,168 $ 5,368 (59.6 )% Operating (loss) income $ (520 ) $ 367 NM Operating margin (24.0 )% 6.8 %  USM segment revenue decreased from the third quarter of fiscal 2017 by 59.6%, or $3.2 million. The decrease in revenue during the third quarter of fiscal 2018 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was due to a $1.4 million decline in sales to select large direct customers. The remainder of the decline was due primarily to the migration of sales to our ODS segment.

Orion Distribution Services Division The ODS segment focuses on selling lighting products through manufacturer representative agencies and a network of broadline North American distributors. This segment is expanding as a result of increased sales through distributors as we continue to develop our agent distribution strategy. This expansion includes the migration of customers from direct sales previously included in the USM segment.

Improving LED product performance and reducing customer return on investment payback periods resulting in increased customer preference for LED lighting products compared to legacy lighting products. Increasing LED lighting product customer sales compared to decreasing HIF product sales. A broader and more diverse customer base and market opportunities compared to our historical commercial and industrial facility customers. Increased importance of highly innovative product designs and features and enhanced product research and development capabilities requiring rapid new product introduction and new methods of product and company differentiation. Significantly reduced product technology life cycles; significantly shorter product inventory shelf lives and the related increased risk of rapidly occurring product technology obsolescence. Increased reliance on international component sources. Less internal product fabrication and production capabilities needed to support LED product assembly. Different and broader types of components, fabrication and assembly processes needed to support LED product assembly compared to our legacy products. Expanding customer bases and sales channels. Significantly longer end user product warranty requirements for LED products compared to our legacy products. As we continue to focus our primary business on selling our LED product lines to respond to the rapidly changing market dynamics in the lighting industry, we face intense competition from an increased number of other LED product companies, a number of which have substantially greater resources and more experience and history with LED lighting products than we do. Management Restructuring and Focus on Profitability On May 25, 2017, our Board of Directors restructured our management team. As part of this restructuring, our Chief Executive Officer, John Scribante, left our Company and Mike Altschaefl, our current Board Chair, assumed the role of Chief Executive Officer. In addition, Scott Green, our Executive Vice President, became our new Chief Operating Officer, with ongoing primary responsibility for improving our revenue generation. Mike Potts and Marc Meade, our current Executive Vice Presidents, remained in their positions and were assigned primary responsibility for substantially reducing our cost structure and for streamlining operations. Bill Hull remained in his position as Chief Financial Officer. Reducing staff positions through a targeted reduction in existing headcount; Reductions in the total compensation of our executive management and board of directors; Reductions in operating expenses, including better control of legal spending, elimination of our racing program and removal of various non-critical back office programs and initiatives. We now believe the above cost reduction plan will result in annualized cost savings of approximately $4.0 to $4.5 million, an increase of $0.5 million from our prior estimate. These cost reductions, coupled with our renewed focus on sales channel execution, will help to drive revenue growth and accelerate our path to profitability.

Product revenue decreased 1.5%, or $984,000. The slight decrease in product revenue was primarily a result of the impact of the softening macro-economic environment in the back half of fiscal 2016. Strong customer response to our next generation high bay product offering drove increased LED sales which were offset by tempered demand in the industrial sector as a result of macro-economic uncertainty. LED lighting revenue increased 48% from $30,800,000 in fiscal 2015 to $45,679,000 in fiscal 2016. Service revenue decreased 56.6%, or $3,584,000, due to higher service revenue in fiscal 2015 primarily due to more solar revenue and project revenue from a significant customer. Total revenue decreased by 6.3%, or $4,568,000, primarily due to the items discussed above. . . .  Jun 13, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

On the sales front, Orion has substantially expanded its national sales reach by forming a network of approximately fifty agencies to build upon Orion's existing direct sales effort focused on a number of major national accounts. Orion estimates that its agent sales base enables it to engage with roughly 77% of potential LED lighting opportunities up from its prior direct sales reach of about 13%. On the cost side, over the past year Orion has reduced annual overhead by approximately 20% or $6M, savings which should be fully reflected in fiscal 2019 beginning April 1, 2018. Management's goal is to advance Orion to breakeven, on an EBITDA basis, by its second quarter ending September 30, 2018, while also working to drive sales growth from its expanded market reach.

On the sales front, Orion has substantially expanded its national sales reach by forming a network of approximately fifty agencies to build upon Orion's existing direct sales effort focused on a number of major national accounts. Orion estimates that the addition of its agent sales base now enables it to engage with roughly 77% of potential LED lighting opportunities up from its prior direct sales reach of approximately 13%. On the cost side, over the past year Orion has reduced annual overhead by approximately 20% or $6M, savings which should be fully reflected in Orion's fiscal 2019 year which starts April 1, 2018. Management's goal is to advance the Company to breakeven, on an EBITDA basis, by its second quarter ending September 30, 2018, at the same time it focuses on driving sales growth from its expanded market reach.

OESX,"MANITOWOC, Wis., Feb 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Orion Energy Systems, Inc. OESX, -1.93% (Orion Lighting), a provider of enterprise-grade LED lighting and energy project solutions, today reported results for its fiscal 2018 third quarter (Q3'18) and nine months ended December 31, 2017. Orion will hold an investor call today at 10:00 a.m. ET (9:00 a.m. CT) to review its results and outlook for the balance of fiscal 2018 - call details below. Quarterly Comparisons             ($ in millions except %) Q3'18 Q2'18 Q1'18 Q4'17 Q3'17 Revenue $ 17.3   $ 15.4   $ 12.6   $ 15.3   $ 20.6   Gross margin   29.6 %   23.5 %   21.6 %   6.0 %   29.9 % Cash $ 10.6   $ 8.7   $ 8.5   $ 17.3   $ 19.1                                   Q3 Highlights: Q3'18 revenue rose 12.3% to $17.3M versus Q2'18. Gross margin improved 610 basis points to 29.6% in Q3'18 versus Q2'18 of 23.5%. Orion identified and is implementing an additional $1.5M in annual cost reductions; increasing total annualized cost reductions to approximately $6.0M. Net loss of $1.4M or $0.05 per basic share. EBITDA loss improved sequentially to $0.8M in Q3'18 versus $3.0M Q2'18. Positive cash flow from operating activities of $1.6M in Q3'18. $10.6M in cash as of December 31, 2017. Sequential improvement in Q3'18 revenue driven principally by strength in national accounts where Orion continues to see increased requests for proposals and large orders, particularly with automotive and government accounts. Orion now expects revenue from its two largest automotive customers to total approximately $12M in FY 2018 and $14M in FY 2019. Orion's agent driven distribution channel continues to develop slowly and accounted for 45% of revenue in Q3'18, with approximately 50 agent relationships at the quarter's close. Orion is achieving good adoption of its new line of Harris LED lighting systems designed to appeal to an expanded base of customers and markets, including new construction. CEO Commentary Mike Altschaefl, Orion's CEO and Board Chair, commented, ""The good news is that we are seeing strengthening demand from large and long-standing national accounts. National accounts made a significant contribution to the sequential revenue improvement in Q3'18, including some traction with our new line of lower cost Harris LED lighting systems. ""We are also seeing progress in our agent driven distribution channel; however, it is developing more slowly than anticipated. We continue to actively manage this channel and are focusing resources to support our top agents, while also seeking to enhance the productivity of the balance of our agent base through additional training and support. We are also replacing agents that have not proven successful in bringing our products to market. Going forward, we are focused on building a base of productive agents to provide us with broad access to opportunities across North America. ""We believe that the strength in our national account activity, combined with our plans and expectations for continued improvement in agent productivity, provide us with confidence in Orion's potential to drive revenue growth in fiscal 2019 and beyond. ""On the cost side, we have identified and are implementing further expense reduction initiatives, including not renewing the lease for our Chicago office, as well as related workforce reductions. ""Our efforts to right size our cost structure over the past year are expected to yield approximately $6M in annual savings; a 20% reduction from FY 2017 levels. We believe these actions further accelerate Orion's path to achieving profitability."" Updated Financial Outlook Orion's quarterly performance can and will likely vary materially from period to period, often based on macroeconomic and industry forces. Orion therefore reminds investors that its stated financial goals are targets and goals - not implied guidance, forecasts or projections. Reflecting the Company's progress to date with major and national accounts and Q3'18 performance, management is updating its revenue goal as follows. Orion now is targeting its Q4'18 revenue to be similar to Q3'18 and its total revenue to be approximately $62M for full year FY 2018, as compared to an earlier goal of approximately $70M. We previously stated our goal of achieving 30% gross margins and breakeven EBITDA, before non-recurring items, by Q4'18. Our Q3'18 results demonstrated our progress toward these goals through an improvement in gross margins and a significant reduction in our sequential quarterly negative EBITDA. Due to our reduction in expected revenues in Q4'18 caused by industry softness and other factors, we now hope to reach these goals by Q2 of fiscal 2019. Orion expects to record non-recurring charges of approximately $0.25M in Q4'18 related to the additional $1.5M in annualized cost reductions. Q3'18 Results Orion's Q3'18 revenue declined 16% to $17.3M compared to Q3'17, including a $2.1M decrease in fluorescent lighting product sales, but improved 12.3% compared to Q2'18. LED lighting product revenue was $14.5M in Q3'18 or 91% of total lighting product revenue versus $15.5M or 82% of total lighting product revenue in Q3'17. Gross margin continued to improve sequentially to 29.6% in Q3'18, compared to 23.5% in Q2'18 and 21.6% in Q1'18, due to higher revenues and improved sourcing and cost management efforts. Gross margin in Q3'18 declined slightly versus gross margin of 29.9% in Q3'17, principally reflecting lower overhead absorption on lower revenue in the recent period. Orion's Q3'18 net loss was $1.4M, or $0.05 per share, versus $1.1M, or $0.04 per share, in Q3'17 principally due to the impact of lower revenues on Orion's fixed cost structure, partially offset by a $0.7M reduction in operating expenses. Orion's net loss was $3.7M, or $0.13 per share, in Q2'18. Orion's Q3'18 EBITDA loss narrowed sequentially to $0.8M from $3.0M in Q2'18. Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Orion generated $1.6M in cash from operating activities in Q3'18, as its net loss was more than offset by active working capital management efforts. At the end of Q3'18, Orion had $10.6M in cash and cash equivalents and $3.6M in borrowings under its revolving credit facility. Resolution of Litigation In August 2016, the Chief Judge of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin (Green Bay Division) dismissed all claims brought against Orion by the Company's former CEO, Neal R. Verfuerth (plaintiff), who was terminated for cause in November 2012. In September 2016, the plaintiff filed an appeal to the United States Court of Appeals challenging the judgment, and in January 2018 a panel of the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals unanimously upheld the dismissal of the lawsuit against Orion.

Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the GAAP results included in this presentation, Orion has also included the non-GAAP measure, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) as a measure of its quarterly performance. The Company has provided this non-GAAP measure to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period to period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to its competitors. Among other things, management uses EBITDA to evaluate performance of the business and believes this measurement enables it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of core business operations. The non-GAAP measurement is intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the Company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurement. As a result, investors should consider this non-GAAP measurement in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

OESX,"MANITOWOC, Wis., Dec 01, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Orion Energy Systems, Inc. OESX, -1.20% (Orion Lighting), a leading designer and U.S. manufacturer of high-performance, energy-efficient LED lighting products, announced today it has received a continued listing deficiency notice from The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC because its share price has not met the $1.00 minimum closing bid price requirement for 30 consecutive business days [Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) and 5810(c)(3)(A)]. This notice has no immediate effect on the Company's Nasdaq listing or the trading of its common stock. Nasdaq has provided Orion with a 180-day period, until May 29, 2018, in which to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If at any time during the compliance period, the closing bid price of Orion's common stock is at least $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, Nasdaq will provide Orion with a written confirmation of compliance and the matter will be closed. Orion CEO, Mike Altschaefl, commented, ""The Board and I believe that Orion's recent share price and modest market cap of roughly 0.4x sales for the last four quarters are a reflection of our past challenges and the transition of our business focus, rather than our growth and profitability goals for the remainder of the fiscal year ending March 31, 2018. We are confident that as we demonstrate progress toward our goals over the next four months, our performance should enhance Orion's share price and market value and enable the Company to regain compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement before May 29, 2018."" Mr. Altschaefl added, ""I have focused the first six months of my tenure as CEO on working to put Orion on a path to sustainable growth and improved bottom-line results. We have largely repositioned the business to achieve those goals. We are confident that as we demonstrate results, our share price should better reflect Orion's future prospects and support our regaining compliance with Nasdaq's minimum $1.00 closing bid price rule."" Potential Second 180-Day Compliance Period Should Orion not regain compliance with the bid price requirement by May 29, 2018, it may be eligible for an additional 180-day compliance period if it meets the market value of publicly held shares requirement for continued listing, all other initial inclusion requirements for The Nasdaq Capital Market, except for the bid price requirement, and provides written notice that it intends to regain compliance with the bid price requirement during the second 180-day compliance period by effecting a reverse split, if necessary.

OESX,"MANITOWOC, Wis., Nov 28, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Orion Energy Systems, Inc. OESX, -1.20% (Orion Lighting), a leading designer and U.S. manufacturer of high-performance, energy-efficient LED lighting products, announced today the receipt of award notifications to retrofit three U.S. Government facilities with Orion's LED lighting systems. Orion expects to record at least $1.4 million in revenue from these awards over the balance of its fiscal 2018 year ending March 31, 2018. The bulk of the revenue will be product sales, along with installation services and some engineering and professional services. Orion is replacing legacy lighting systems at the government facilities with its energy-efficient LED lighting platforms and controls, in support of the customer's environmental and energy efficiency goals. The customer expects to reduce its annual lighting energy usage by approximately 70%, providing savings that should allow the full recoupment of all project costs in just a few years. The awards follow several projects completed for this government entity over the past few years. Orion anticipates additional retrofit opportunities from this customer in future periods. Orion CEO, Mike Altschaefl, commented, ""We are proud to serve our Country and build upon past work with this valued, long-time U.S. government customer. These awards confirm the strength of our product platform, design, features and value proposition - factors that are resonating with a growing base of new and existing customers. ""Importantly, they also confirm our customer's confidence in Orion, our commitment to customer satisfaction, and the strong working relationship we have built over several years. Our activity in the government sector continues to be strong, and we are eager to bid on future projects for this customer.""

OESX,"MANITOWOC, Wis., Nov 02, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Orion Energy Systems, Inc. OESX, -1.20% (Orion Lighting), a leading designer and U.S. manufacturer of high-performance, energy-efficient LED lighting products, today reported results for its fiscal 2018 second quarter (Q2'18) and six months ended September 30, 2017. Orion will hold an investor call today at 10:00 a.m. ET (9:00 a.m. CT) to review its results and outlook for the balance of fiscal 2018 - call details below. Quarterly Performance Highlights (in M except %) Q2'18 Q1'18 Q4'17 Q3'17 Q2'17 Q1'17 Revenue $15.4 $12.6 $15.3 $20.6 $18.7 $15.6 Gross margin 23.5% 21.6% 6.0% 29.9% 33.4% 25.8% Cash & equivalents $8.7 $8.5 $17.3 $19.1 $18.7 $14.2 Highlights Q2'18 revenue improved sequentially to $15.4M vs. $12.6M in Q1'18. Approximately $1.1M of revenue was delayed by storm related events but is expected in the balance of FY 2018. Orion is experiencing increased requests for proposals as well as awarded business from large national accounts. Orion increased its previously announced estimated annual cost reductions to $4.0M to $4.5M from the initial estimate of $3.5M to $4.0M. Positive Q2'18 cash flow from operating activities of $1.1M. $3.4M of revenue came from two of Orion's long standing automotive industry customers in Q2'18 and Orion is now expecting approximately $13M in revenue in fiscal 2018 from these two automotive customers, up from Orion's previously announced $10M. Additionally, Orion expects revenue of at least $10M from these customers in fiscal 2019. Orion's agent-driven distribution model continues to make steady progress, representing 44 % of product sales in Q2'18. While Orion is advancing this effort, it is taking longer than anticipated for new agencies to achieve revenue generation expectations. Q2 '18 backlog of $6.5M was flat compared to Q1 '18. CEO Commentary: Mike Altschaefl, Orion CEO, commented, ""We made progress during Q2 2018, achieving sequential quarterly revenue growth of 22.2% and achieving positive cash flow from operations. While we are seeing steady progress in this effort, it is taking longer than we had planned for new agencies to ramp revenue generation with Orion solutions. At the same time, we are becoming better versed in the opportunities and challenges in building out this sales channel. Through a variety of new strategies and products designed to support the needs of our agents we believe we are positioning Orion to accelerate its future penetration of a much broader base of sales opportunities for both retrofit and new construction projects across North America."" ""Under our new Senior Vice President for Channel Sales, Kevin Grayson, we now better understand the sales cycle and specific dynamics of this channel and are tailoring our product offerings and marketing efforts to best support our agents. While the agent channel continues to develop, our national accounts group is doing an excellent job of sourcing more and larger projects from key accounts, as well as new opportunities for the agent base."" ""In August, we stated that we expected approximately $10M of business in fiscal 2018 and approximately $10M in fiscal 2019 from two of our long standing automotive customers. Demand from these customers during our first six months of fiscal 2018 was stronger than expected, driving $5.5M of revenue. As a result, we now expect at least $13.0M in revenue during fiscal year 2018. We continue to expect revenues of at least $10M in fiscal 2019."" ""We have recently launched a number of products centered around three main objectives: Increasing our competitive product footprint with the agent driven distribution channel and entry-level focused buyers  Leveraging existing platforms and expanding options to increase our market opportunity  Leveraging our experience in controls and IoT solution adaptability through new modular plug and play solutions"" ""The summer launch of our lower-cost Patriot(TM) LED lighting fixture line is an example of this effort. It is a high quality, US-made product with industry-leading components, streamlined design and an upgradable modular feature that competes very effectively with offshore products. With Patriot(TM) LED fixtures, customers can make the move into energy-saving LED lighting at an attractive price, while preserving the ability to quickly and easily upgrade this system with plug-in sensors, light engines or other features of our higher performing lines."" ""Our core value proposition remains unchanged and is centered around four pillars of commitment that we believe differentiate us from our competition: Industry leading product performance, energy efficiency, and thought leadership - delivering more rapid ROI and future proof lighting options Genuine, high-quality and high-touch customer service Flexibility and nimbleness in responding to customer needs, including specialty design, development, prototyping, and production - which larger competitors cannot match, and Rapid response local-to-local production operations delivering the quality and reliability our customers expect - typically in 10 days or less"" Updated Fiscal 2018 Outlook Mr. Altschaefl added, ""While the outlook for growth in the LED lighting industry remains difficult to predict, we remain confident in the value, performance and ROI of our lighting products and believe we are on the right path for growth and improved bottom line results. Given our first half performance, we are reducing our fiscal 2018 revenue goals as discussed below. However, we remain firmly committed to our previous profitability goals."" Orion's quarterly performance can and likely will vary materially from period to period, often based on macroeconomic and industry forces. Orion therefore reminds investors that its stated financial goals are targets and goals - not implied guidance, forecasts or projections. Based on progress to date with major and national accounts, supported by the ongoing implementation of its agent driven distribution model, Orion has revised its fiscal 2018 revenue goal to flat versus FY17, as compared to its prior goal of 10-15% growth. Additionally, Orion continues to make solid progress in trimming its annual operating expenses, with annualized reductions now estimated at $4.0 to $4.5M versus FY17 levels, compared to an initial estimate of $3.5 to $4.0M. Further, Orion continues to believe it will be able to achieve its goal of breakeven earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), before non-recurring items, and gross margins of 30%, by its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter. Mr. Altschaefl concluded, ""While our performance is not yet where it needs to be, we believe we are taking the right steps to position Orion for success. We have strong design and production capabilities, high quality products, a respected brand portfolio and a refined go-to-market strategy that should differentiate us within the LED lighting industry. We have taken prudent steps regarding our cost structure to increase profitability even at lower revenues. This cost structure should not change once modest revenue growth is realized. In other words, we are scaling the business effectively. We believe the second half of fiscal 2018 will provide a great opportunity for investors to judge the success of our efforts."" Q2'18 Operations Orion's Q2'18 revenue declined 17.4% from Q2 '17 to $15.4M, reflecting $1.1M of hurricane-related project delays in Texas and Florida and a predicted decline in fluorescent lighting products, which decreased $2.0M year-over-year. Partially offsetting these declines was strength in national accounts, including $3.4M of automotive retrofit revenue and modest progress from the Company's agent driven distribution model, now representing 44% of product revenue. LED lighting product revenue was $12.7M in Q2'18 or 91% of total lighting product revenue versus $14.1M or 81% of total lighting product revenue in Q2'17. Despite a solid performance in raw gross margins from lighting product sales, total gross margin declined to 23.5% in Q2'18, as a result of lower overhead absorption on lower revenue, combined with lower service revenue margins. Orion's Q2'18 net loss increased to $3.7M, or $0.13 per basic share, from $1.0M, or $0.03 per basic share, in Q2'17. The higher net loss was principally due to the impact of lower revenues on Orion's fixed cost structure, partially offset by a $0.9M reduction in operating expenses (excluding one-time items), a direct result of the Company's cost reduction efforts. Orion's Q2'18 results included a $0.7M non-cash impairment charge related to an indefinite lived intangible asset. Orion has recognized $0.1M and $2.0M of total restructuring expense during the three and six months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Orion's Q2'18 EBITDA loss was $3.0M compared to $0.3M in Q2'17. Balance Sheet & Cash Flow Orion generated $1.1 M in cash from operating activities in Q2'18 as its net loss was more than offset by active working capital management efforts, including a $3.0M reduction in product inventories. At the end of Q2'18, Orion had $8.7M in cash and cash equivalents and $3.1M in borrowings under its revolving credit facility.

Orion systems incorporate patented design elements that deliver significant energy, efficiency, optical and thermal performance that drive financial, environmental, and work-space benefits for a wide variety of customers, including nearly 40% of the Fortune 500. Non-GAAP Measures In addition to the GAAP results included in this presentation, Orion has also included the non-GAAP measure, EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) as a measure of its quarterly performance. The Company has provided this non-GAAP measure to help investors better understand its core operating performance, enhance comparisons of core operating performance from period to period and allow better comparisons of operating performance to its competitors. Among other things, management uses EBITDA to evaluate performance of the businesses and believes this measurement enables it to make better period-to-period evaluations of the financial performance of core business operations. The non-GAAP measurements are intended only as a supplement to the comparable GAAP measurements and the Company compensates for the limitations inherent in the use of non-GAAP measurements by using GAAP measures in conjunction with the non-GAAP measurements. As a result, investors should consider these non-GAAP measurements in addition to, and not in substitution for or as superior to, measurements of financial performance prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

OESX,"MANITOWOC, Wis., Aug 29, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Orion Energy Systems, Inc. OESX, -1.20% (Orion Lighting), a leading designer and U.S. manufacturer of high-performance, energy-efficient LED lighting products, announced today that it has received award notifications that the company expects to receive firm commitments for LED lighting systems and services from two long-standing automotive customers which it expects will total at least $10 million in revenue during its fiscal year ending March 31, 2018 (FY'18). The projects encompass multiple automotive plants which are upgrading legacy fluorescent lighting systems, several of which had been provided by Orion, to energy-efficient LED lighting platforms and controls in support of these customers' environmental and energy efficiency goals. One automotive customer selected Orion to provide engineering studies for the lighting needs of all of its North American plants and has specified Orion as its sole lighting provider for these facilities. Orion expects to complete LED lighting retrofit projects for five of this customer's U.S. plants in FY'18 and has already begun to receive initial product purchase orders for the first four plants. Orion is providing a range of LED lighting products and control systems to this customer with a principal focus on its ISON(TM) Class High Bay (HBIF3) LED lighting fixtures which deliver over 214 lumens per watt, making them the lighting industry's highest performing LED high bay fixtures. Revenues from the five plants will be primarily from product sales but will also include installation services for some of the plants as well as engineering and other professional services. The second major automotive customer has provided initial awards and notices to proceed with product deliveries for LED lighting installations at two manufacturing plants. Revenues are also anticipated over the balance of fiscal 2018. Orion CEO Mike Altschaefl, commented, ""We are proud that two large and long-standing automotive customers have extended their commitment to Orion lighting solutions, confirming the strength of our innovative LED lighting product lines and our talented engineering, design and customer service teams. We have already completed $3.3 million in orders from these customers and expect the balance of the work to be spread through the rest of our fiscal year. Importantly, these projects are supported by energy-efficiency, enhanced controls including IoT solutions, performance advantages and environmental benefits that provide our customers with a compelling return on investment. We anticipate further significant projects from these customers in fiscal 2019."" Mr. Altschaefl added, ""We are also seeing steady progress in our agent driven distribution model, including solid engagement with national accounts, and our recent new product introductions are resonating well with customers and agents. We expect these new offerings to contribute to our business in the coming quarters.""

OESX,"MANITOWOC, Wis., Jun 08, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Orion Energy Systems, Inc. OESX, -1.20% , a leading designer and manufacturer of high-performance, energy-efficient LED lighting products, reported results for its fiscal 2017 fourth quarter (Q4’17) and fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Orion will hold an investor call today at 4:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. CT) to review its results and discuss its plans to drive growth and accelerate its path to profitability. Call details below. Fiscal 2017 Financial Highlights Revenue rose 4% to $70.2M; Gross margin expanded 110 basis points to 24.7% versus 23.6% in FY 2016; Net loss was $12.3M in FY 2017 compared to $20.1M in FY 2016; Cash and cash equivalents were $17.3M at fiscal 2017 year-end; and Year-end order backlog rose to $7.3M at FY 2017 year-end versus $5.6M in FY 2016 year-end.                                               FY 2017   Q4’17   Q3’17   Q2’17   Q1’17   FY 2016   Q4’16   Q3’16   Q2’16   Q1’16 Revenue ($M)   $70.2   $15.3   $20.6   $18.7   $15.6   $67.6   $18.6   $16.8   $15.7   $16.6 Gross Margin   24.7%   6.0%   29.9%   33.4%   25.8%   23.6%   24.9%   28.1%   18.5%   22.7% Cash & equivalents ($M)   $17.3   $17.3   $19.1   $18.7   $14.2   $15.5   $15.5   $17.5   $13.4   $17.9                     Fiscal 2017 Operational Highlights Orion has transitioned its go-to-market strategy from direct sales to an agency driven model, substantially increasing Orion’s market reach. The agent channel delivered 43% of FY 2017 product sales vs. 4% in FY 2016. Orion ended FY 2017 with 42 agents reaching 95% of the U.S. and Canada; it plans to expand to 50 agents, net of turnover, by Q2 of fiscal 2018. During FY 2017, Orion launched its ISON™ Class Gen III LED High Bay lighting fixture, the first and only fixture to break the 200 lumen per watt energy efficiency barrier, along with a variety of new products and features tailored for healthcare, food service, agribusiness, extreme temperature environments and other market segments. Fiscal 2018 Realignment and Cost Reduction Initiatives Orion recently announced executive management changes and a companywide realignment focused on cost reductions intended to accelerate the Company's path to profitability, while maintaining its existing sales and product growth strategies. Orion expects to trim $3.5 - $4.0 million of annualized costs, or approximately 12-13% versus FY 2017 levels, under its cost reduction plan and will record non-recurring charges related to its cost initiatives totaling $1.5 - $2.0 million, principally in Q1 FY 2018. As part of its cost reduction plan, Orion’s executive team and outside directors are reducing their total annual compensation by approximately 35%, compared to FY 2017 levels. Fiscal 2018 Outlook Given recent demand fluctuations in the market for retrofit LED lighting and limited visibility on near-term demand trends, management is not providing specific financial guidance for fiscal 2018 at this time. However, management is providing a directional outlook and goals for 2018 as follows. Orion expects the continued execution of its agent-driven sales strategy should enable it to achieve a revenue growth goal of 10-15% for full year FY 2018. Further, based on this targeted revenue growth goal and the implementation of its cost reduction initiatives, Orion believes it can reach its goals of achieving a 30% gross profit margin and breakeven on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) basis, by its fiscal 2018 fourth quarter, before non-recurring items. As noted above, Orion expects to record a non-recurring charge of $1.5 - $2.0 million, principally in Q1 FY 2018, related to its cost cutting initiatives. Orion cautions investors that these are full fiscal year goals and targets, and that Orion’s quarterly and full fiscal year performance could vary materially from these targets. Orion will revisit its FY 2018 directional outlook and financial goals on each quarterly earnings call and update them as appropriate. CEO Commentary Mike Altschaefl, Orion’s Board Chair and newly appointed CEO, commented, “I am excited and proud to assume the executive leadership of Orion at a very exciting time in our industry. We are very confident in our refocused plan to build upon our strong platform of customers, products, personnel, technology and our growing base of agent and distribution relationships at the core of Orion’s growth opportunities. Our sales and product growth strategies are not changing. We are renewing our focus on execution, including a reduction in our cost structure that will accelerate Orion’s path to profitability. “Investments in ramping our sales activities and on-going R&D to maintain our technology leadership will remain key priorities. We have identified approximately $3.5 - $4.0 million in annualized costs to be eliminated in fiscal 2018, including several initiatives already completed. We expect to have a majority of our plan complete by June 30 [th] and the balance by the end of September. Cost reductions will be shared across all levels of the organization, including total executive and board compensation, which we have reduced by approximately 35%, or $1.5 million, compared to FY 2017 levels. “Considering the strength of our products, reputation, industry position and the expected benefits of our expanded agent network becoming increasingly productive, we feel confident that topline growth of 10-15% remains a realistic goal for fiscal 2018, although likely weighted toward the second half of the year. Based on this anticipated growth trajectory, combined with the execution of our cost reductions, we believe Orion should be on track to reach our goal of EBITDA breakeven by the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, before taking into account non-recurring items,“ said Altschaefl. Fiscal 2017 Review Orion executed well on multiple fronts during fiscal 2017; however, as previously previewed, full year financial performance did not meet the company’s growth expectations, principally due to an unforeseen industry slowdown in demand in Q4 ‘17. Revenue: Orion’s FY 2017 revenue grew 4% to $70.2M, driven principally by increasing sales volume of LED fixtures, new product offerings and the shift in sales focus from a direct sales model to an agent model that provides much broader reach into national accounts. These factors more than offset (i) the ongoing intended decline in Orion’s legacy fluorescent business, which contracted by $6.1 million in FY 2017 versus FY 2016; (ii) the year-over-year decline in LED component pricing, which reduced Orion’s average selling prices; and (iii) an unanticipated reduction in demand across the industry early in Q4’17. LED Revenue: LED product sales rose 16.3% to $53.1 million versus $45.7 million in FY 2016, reflecting increasing customer demand for the enhanced performance and energy efficiency of Orion’s LED lighting products, particularly its high-bay LED fixtures. FY 2017 LED lighting product revenue rose to 81.4% of total lighting product sales, a new record for Orion. Gross Margin: A more favorable product mix and ongoing manufacturing efficiencies contributed to a 110 basis point expansion in Orion’s gross margin from 23.6% in FY 2016 to 24.7% in FY 2017. Orion’s FY 2017 gross margin included the anticipated impact of $2.2 million of non-cash charges to cost of product sales during the fourth quarter. These charges reflected an increase in inventory reserves of $1.7 million and the write-off of $0.5 million of supplies inventory. The increase in inventory reserves reflected the growing customer preference for higher performing LED lighting technologies, which has slowed demand for lower-priced earlier generation lighting solutions, particularly in the retrofit market that is Orion’s focus. Net Loss: Orion’s FY 2017 net loss was $12.3 million, or $0.44 per basic share, compared to $20.1 million, or $0.73 per basic share, in FY 2016. Orion’s FY 2017 results included a $0.3 million impairment charge related to an intangible asset, and FY 2016 included a $6.0 million impairment charge related to goodwill and long lived assets. The reduced FY 2017 net loss reflects revenue and gross margin improvements and a reduction in general and administrative expense, offset by controlled increases in selling, marketing and R&D expenses. Operating Cash Flow: Orion used $1.9 million in cash from operating activities in FY 2017, with net loss adjusted for non-cash items, partially offset by improvements in receivables, inventory and other assets. Balance Sheet: Orion had $17.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $6.8 million in long-term borrowings at the close of fiscal 2017. Net working capital was $25.5 million as of March 31, 2017, and shareholder equity was $35.5 million, or $1.26 per diluted share (shareholder’s equity divided by 28.2 million weighted-average common shares outstanding, adjusted for share equivalents outstanding, at March 31, 2017)   Conference Call Details:   Date / Time:     Today, Thursday, June 8, 2017 at 4:30 p.m. ET (3:30 p.m. CT) Call Dial-In: (877) 754-5294 or (678) 894-3013 for international Live Webcast/Replay: http://investor.oriones.com/events.cfm Audio Replay: (855) 859-2056, conference ID: 34661718 (available shortly after the call through 06/15/2017)   About Orion Energy Systems Orion is a leading designer and producer of energy efficient lighting and retrofit lighting solutions for commercial and industrial buildings.
