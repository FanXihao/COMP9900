O,"One might have thought the stage was set for another excellent year for U.S. stocks after President Trump signed the legislation that reduced the federal corporate income-tax rate to 21% from 35% in December. But you might not have expected the market to move so dramatically. Netflix is far and away the early leader in the S&P 500’s US:SPX broad rally this year. The index has returned 6.3% during the first 17 trading sessions of 2018, through Jan. 25, with dividends reinvested, adding to its remarkable return of 21.8% in 2017. (The S&P 500 actually comprises 505 stocks, because several companies have more than one class of common shares included in the index.) The index has closed at a record 13 times this month, the most records for any calendar month since February 1998. Read: ‘FOMO’ stock market sees a week of record inflows And it may be time to put some perspective on every time the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA rises by another 1,000 points. After all, a 1,000-point gain from its last milestone of 26,000 on Jan. 17 would be gain of 4%. That’s lovely, but not dramatic. The Dow is up 6.9% this year (and has set 10 record closes), following last year’s return of 21.8%. Among the S&P’s 505 components: • 117 have had double-digit total returns. • 232 have beaten the market with total returns of 6.4% or more. • 408 have shown positive returns. • One is flat. That would be Celgene Corp. US:CELG which reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results on Jan. 25 after announcing on Jan. 22 an agreement to acquire Juno Therapeutics Inc. US:JUNO for $9 billion. • 96 are down. • 35 are down 5% or more, including five that are down 10% or more. Sector performance For 2018, many professional investors expect a healthy environment for the energy sector, because of strong demand for oil brought about by accelerating growth in all major world economies. West Texas Intermediate crude oil US:CL1  has risen 8% this year, to $65.51 a barrel as of the close on Jan. 24. Jim Brilliant, who manages the CM Advisors Fixed Income Fund US:CMFIX  said in an interview that simultaneous economic growth around the world will signal a “rotation” for stocks away from higher-growth industries into value plays in the industrial, energy and materials sectors.

US:NFLX  is the runaway winner, returning 40%, with investors cheering the company’s fourth-quarter sales and earnings results. The stock closed at $269.70 on Jan. 25 and traded for 117.3 times the consensus 2018 earnings estimate of $2.30 a share. That’s a remarkably high forward price-to-earnings ratio. Then again, Netflix is always expensive, and if the company can continue growing its sales at a 30%+ pace, you can expect the stock to maintain a high valuation to earnings. Two-thirds of sell-side analysts rate the stock a buy, according to FactSet. But the consensus price target is $258.86, showing the analysts as a group don’t expect the stock to rise from here over the next 12 months. Much more on Netflix and earnings season: • Netflix analysts continue to focus on growth, overlook cash flow • Netflix sees sharks approaching from both sides in Apple and Disney • Individual stocks are getting a much bigger-than-usual jolt out of earnings Here are the 35 worst-performing S&P 500 stocks: Company Ticker Industry Total Return - YTD Total Return - 2017 Newell Brands Inc.

O,"As U.S. equity markets hit record highs, stocks with high dividend yields remain popular, despite the Federal Reserve’s inclination to raise official interest rates. There are several ways to screen dividend-paying companies, and we’ll share two of them here, while listing the 35 highest-yielding stocks in the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.97% Dreading dividend cuts One of the riskiest aspects of dividend stocks is the prospect of a dividend cut. If investors expect the dividend to decline, the stock price is almost certain to plunge, which will push the yield higher until the cut is announced. Read: These six investment newsletters have delivered top returns in good and bad markets S&P Dow Jones Indices maintains a list of roughly 50 S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which are companies included in that benchmark index that have increased their regular dividend payments for at least 25 consecutive years. However, many Dividend Aristocrat stocks have low yields. Any analysis of a company’s financial performance is backward looking, so there can never be a guarantee that you won’t suffer a dividend cut. However, we can present data that will provide comfort or at least some warnings. ROCC Using data provided by FactSet, we looked at the 35 S&P 500 SPX, -0.97%  stocks with the highest dividend yields. We’re going to list them twice (three times for real estate investment trusts). First, we will show how the companies have performed against industry competitors, as measured by their returns on corporate capital (ROCC). ROCC was recently developed by the Shareholder Forum. The calculation is similar to return on invested capital (ROIC), but there are some differences. Definitions of ROIC vary. ROCC is calculated the same way for every company that’s publicly traded in the U.S., using annual data filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission: Net income plus interest expense and income taxes, divided by the ending balance of total assets less total liabilities other than interest-bearing debt. The idea is to measure how good a company’s management is at investing the money it raises or borrows. Each company’s ROCC is compared to its industry competitors, based on the company’s Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), which also comes from SEC filings. Those comparisons are available for free here. So a company’s ROCC is not simply compared to the average ROCC for its SIC group. Instead, a calculation is made for the aggregated assets and income data for the entire SIC group, excluding for the subject company. This means that the industry ROCCs for two companies in the same group may be different. ROCC is most meaningful within industries. Banks, for example, tend to have lower ROCC than many other industries because it is their business to leverage capital by gathering deposits and borrowing money. You can get quite a bit of insight if you compare a company’s ROCC to its industry competitors. For example, the five-year ROCC trend for Altria Group Inc. MO, -0.32% is up, while the trend for its competitors in the cigarettes SIC group is down: The Shareholder Forum If the ROCC trend curve for a company you are interested in is heading south, something may be very wrong, and you had better do additional research to find out what is going on. On Nov. 13, General Electric Co. GE, -1.00%  said it would cut its dividend in half. That was not a surprise for investors, as company CEO John Flannery had said the dividend policy was under review as part of an effort to shore up cash. Check out GE’s ROCC trend against that of its industry group: The Shareholder Forum The ROCC indicated that GE’s management just wasn’t getting it done. Here are the 35 S&P 500 stocks with the highest yields, with five-year average ROCC comparisons and indications of whether the companies have cut their dividend payments at any time over the past five or 10 years: Company Ticker Dividend yield - Nov. 24 SIC group Average ROCC Average ROCC for industry competitors Dividend cut over past five years?

However, but this does not mean a company didn’t initiate a regular dividend payout during either of these periods. CenturyLink CTL, +0.09% is the highest-yielding S&P 500 stock. A yield of 15.61% makes it very clear that many investors expect the company to cut its dividend. The company last cut its dividend on Feb. 13, 2013, when it announced a 26% reduction in the regular payout on the same day it unveiled a $2 billion buyback. That was quite a smack in the face for investors who were relying on the dividend income. The stock dropped 23% the following day. During the company’s most recent earnings conference call with analysts on Nov. 8, CenturyLink CEO Glen Post said: “We realize the dividend is an attractive part of our shareholder return, and we are confident we can continue to pay the dividend while investing in growth and in our network and as we de-lever our balance sheet.” A dividend cut that happened many years ago may not indicate that a company’s current payout is threatened. An example is Altria, which cut its dividend in 2008 after Kraft and Philip Morris International Inc. were spun off, so that shareholders of the former parent and spun-off companies would initially receive the same aggregate payouts. A shorter-term approach: free cash flow yield Leaving long-term performance aside, a company’s free cash flow yield can indicate whether it can comfortably continue to pay its current dividend or raise the dividend. Free cash flow is remaining cash flow after planned capital expenditures. It is money that can be used to raise the dividend, repurchase shares, expand through acquisitions, reinvest in plants and equipment, or do other things to grow the business organically. We can calculate a company’s free cash flow yield by dividing its free cash flow per share over the past 12 months by the current share price. If we then compare the free cash flow yield to the current dividend yield, we can see if the company has “headroom” to increase the dividend. If we look again at GE, we can see that as of the market close on Nov. 10, before the dividend cut was announced, the dividend yield was 4.69%. The company’s free cash flow yield over the previous 12 months was minus 1.27%. Its free cash flow per share was negative during three of the past four reported quarters. If a company’s 12-month free cash flow yield is lower than its dividend yield, it does not necessarily mean a dividend cut is coming. The company may have made an important acquisition using a lot of cash, skewing the results for a year. Or there could be other good reasons for a temporary reduction in cash flow. But you had better find out. For real estate investment trusts, a non-GAAP measure called funds from operations (FFO) is typically used by investors to gauge dividend-paying ability. FFO adds depreciation and amortization back to earnings, while subtracting gains on property sales. In the next table, we will show the same group of highest-yielding S&P 500 stocks with free cash flow yields based on GAAP. This will be followed by an FFO yield table for the REITs. Here are free cash flow yield comparisons for the 35 highest-yielding S&P 500 stocks: Company Ticker Dividend yield - Nov. 24 Free cash flow yield - past 12 reported months ‘Headroom’ CenturyLink Inc.

O,"While looking through analysts’ reports this week, I came across a company name that was unfamiliar, but it struck a chord: Air Products & Chemicals. It amuses my editor when a company has such a generic name. We decided to run with this idea and the results were surprising, to say the least. We scanned the S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.96%  for similarly named companies to see how well their shares had performed. Maybe the generic names of the companies indicate that their long-term management culture is to focus on providing excellent products and services rather than on hyperbole and spin. We defined a “generic” company name as one that states what the company does, right at the beginning, while not beginning with the name of a place or a descriptive word that means nothing. So we excluded Applied Materials Inc. AMAT, -2.79%  and American Airlines Group Inc. AAL, -2.23% to name two examples. It may seem that we’re splitting hairs, and we certainly are, as was our prerogative when conducting such an unscientific study, but we did include Bank of America Corp. BAC, -1.30% because the “of America” description comes at the end of the name. This gave us an arbitrary list of a dozen companies.

So nine of our 12 generically named companies have outperformed the S&P 500 this year, while eight beat the S&P 500 for three years, nine for five years and 10 for 10 years. Maybe the generic names of the companies indicate that their long-term management culture is to focus on providing excellent products and services, rather than on hyperbole and spin. Bank of America was the only generically named company with a negative 10-year return, which isn’t very surprising when considering how dire the credit crisis of 2008 and its stock-market aftermath was. So what does it mean when an arbitrarily selected list of companies performs so much better than the entire S&P 500? Not very much, although it does underline the hit-and-miss nature of stock picking. There’s a good reason so many investors have been flocking to index funds and passively managed ETF over recent years: It’s very difficult for active managers to beat a broad index. Return on corporate capital But we might some insight into why most of these companies have outperformed the S&P 500 by comparing them with their peers. One way to do this is to look at the new return on corporate capital (ROCC) calculations provided by the Shareholder Forum. A company’s ROCC is its net income plus interest expense and income taxes, divided by the ending balance of total assets less total liabilities other than interest-bearing debt. It is similar to return on invested capital (ROIC), however, it is uniformly calculated using GAAP data from SEC filings. You can look up ROCC for individual companies here, going back five years, with each company compared to its industry group. We recently looked at ROCC for industrial conglomerates and the 30 companies that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Here are comparisons of five-year average ROCC for our dozen generically named companies: Company Ticker ROCC - five-year average ROCC - five-year average for industry group Air Products & Chemicals Inc.

O,"Shares of construction, real-estate companies and real-estate investment trusts led S&P 500 gainers on Tuesday, after some positive comment on the sector from industry insiders and a growing view among analysts that the sector’s recent drubbing may be overdone. Mall REITs in particular have seen their shares pummeled in the last year as investors react to the weak traffic trends and store closures that are making headlines in the retail sector. Data released last week by real estate researcher Reis Inc. showed vacancy rates in shopping centers rose in 28 of 77 U.S. metro areas in the first quarter from the year-earlier period, a slight improvement from the fourth quarter, The Wall Street Journal reported. See: From a risk-of-bankruptcy standpoint, the retail business is the new oil and gas Retail REIT executives speaking at the NYU Schack Institute symposium last week argued that malls cannot be lumped together as one but should be evaluated individually based on quality. Sandeep Mathrani, Chief Executive of GGP Inc. US:GGP said the pipeline of retailers seeking high-quality property is “very deep,” REIT.com and other media outlets reported. “If you invest in the best real estate, you will thrive,” Mathrani said. Read now: 11 retailers still thriving as Amazon threatens on all fronts Jeffrey Olson, CEO of Urban Edge Properties US:UE  , said his company had a portfolio occupancy rate of 96% when it was spun off from Vornado Realty Trust US:VNO   in 2015, that has now climbed to 98%.

O,"The last three months have been full of fireworks, but the stock market has continued to climb the proverbial “wall of worry.” The S&P 500 SPX, -1.17%   is up 9.9% since Election Day through Friday and sets new highs seemingly each week, including Friday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.74% which has set seven straight record closes through Friday, remains comfortably above 20,000 and looks like it will stay there. But despite the rally, many investors are nervous. After all, markets front-loaded gains for 2017 in November and December, and it’s now up to President Trump and a Republican Congress to follow through on a business-friendly agenda that investors have already priced in to shares. Furthermore, while markets hung tough during Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen’s latest visit to Capitol Hill, we saw a tremendous spike of about 20% in the CBOE Volatility Index VIX, +7.91% over just a few days. That’s a clear sign many traders are feeling uncertain about what the future holds in regards to interest rates and how that may impact the stock market. And let’s not forget that all this optimism in recent weeks may not materialize in the form of real economic growth. Recently, the World Bank warned that economic expansion in the developed world is painfully small, with just a 1.8% a growth rate expected this year. If you’re feeling a bit worried about the state of the stock-market rally, you have good reason. But as the last few years have shown, those who hide out in cash can miss out big by misinterpreting the signs. So what’s an investor to do if he or she wants to limit risk in this uncertain environment, but not bail out on the markets altogether? Simple: hide out in low-risk dividend stocks that offer stability and a steady stream of income that can offset any volatility and provide gains even if the stock market runs out of gas. Here are three such low-risk dividend payers I like right now: Realty Income With dividends paid since 1969, Realty Income Corp. O, -0.70% should be on every income investor’s radar. But equally compelling is the fact that dividends are paid on a monthly basis instead of a quarterly basis — providing much more regular paydays than your typical dividend payer. And with a yield of about 4.2% currently, it’s not chump change. The reason Realty Income can offer such nice payouts is because it generates reliable cash flow from 4,600 properties. These sites are occupied by a wide number of industries that include bulletproof tenants such as Walgreens drugstores, AMC movie theaters and FedEx shipping facilities, just to name a few. With stable long-term leases and high-quality clients, those monthly payout will keep rolling in. And with an amazing track record that spans 76 consecutive quarters of ever-higher payouts, you can be expect this dividend growth name to increase its cash dividend across 2017 as well. How credit scores predict what you will buy next If you’re worried about the possibility of a strong dollar dragging down multinationals in 2017, the domestic focus of Realty Income is a great hedge. Furthermore, the long-term leases of Realty Income will provide insulation from short-term market volatility. And heck, if it just so happens that we see a big stimulus that kick-starts retailers, you can indirectly participate in the upside. AT&T Yes, even boring old AT&T Inc. T, -0.88% ! Of course, if you have been paying attention, you’d know AT&T is anything but boring after gains of almost 20% in 2016. The ride is far from over. While everyone is obsessed with the future of the company’s proposed $85 billion merger with Time Warner Inc. TWX, +0.36% the important thing to remember is that this stock is an income powerhouse that won’t quit regardless of what happens with its content plans. Sure, AT&T would love to bolster streaming content offerings and have a stake in properties like CNN and HBO that are owned by Time Warner. But look elsewhere and you’ll see this isn’t the only bet AT&T is making, as it has forged ahead with a faster 5G network that supports the public’s reliance on mobile browsing. As a result, while rival Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -0.82% recently issued weak guidance amid anemic wireless growth in January, AT&T earnings showed improved its “churn” rate and is making headway. And let’s not forget that it continues to evolve and integrate its DirecTV business, purchased back in 2014. Even without a content arm like Time Warner, it still has a stranglehold on distribution. This medical device scans your brain on marijuana Bears will note that AT&T didn’t exactly blow the doors off its fourth-quarter earnings report, with revenue down by a tiny amount year-over-year. But this is not a growth stock where double-digit revenue expansion is necessary. Instead, investors should focus on operating cash flow and free cash flow where the dividend payments come from — and both were very strong. Specifically, cash from operations was $10.1 billion, and free cash flow was $3.7 billion, up 19.2%. AT&T yields an impressive 4.8% as of this writing and pays out just 65% of earnings per share. That all but ensures a reliable dividend — and, more than likely, future increases in that payout. At a forward P/E of less than 14, this entrenched telecom is a very safe bet here. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners In any economic environment, dividend investors should be looking for stable investments with reliable cash flow. And if you really want a bit more security, you should also look for “wide moat” companies that have deep pockets to sustain themselves as well as major barriers to entry in their particular market. All these things perfectly describe Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. BIP, +0.20% an industrial player that builds, buys and operates a wide array of infrastructure assets. Here are a few areas: •2.6 million direct customer electricity and natural gas connections worldwide •38 ports in North America, Australia and Europe •Over 2,000 miles of toll roads in regions from South America and India •Large rail operations in Australia and South America Brookfield Infrastructure offers a dividend yield of about 4.8% right now, but it also has seen steady share appreciation of about 90% over the last five years vs. about 70% for the S&P 500 in the same period. Richard Thaler: Here's the best investing strategy The risks aren’t zero for this stock, to be honest, since it is so globally connected and there are a lot of local issues that can affect operations — everything from damage caused by a hurricane to local trade disputes. However, the diversification across sectors and around the globe helps mitigate those risks. There are many pieces in the global economic puzzle, but key infrastructure like roads and rails and power grids are some of the most important parts — in both good times and in bad. That means Brookfield Infrastructure is one of the safest bets out there for 2017. With the potential for a sentiment bounce if and when we ever see an infrastructure bill passed by Congress, Brookfield Infrastucture looks very secure for the rest of 2017.

O,"Some may say it’s foolish to buy shares of dividend stocks when interest rates are rising. But companies that steadily increase dividend payouts have a special allure as long-term investments. And the proof is that, last year, dividend stocks kept pace with the broader S&P 500 Index SPX, -0.96%  despite the fact that the Federal Reserve had at the end of 2015 raised official rates for the first time in nine years. In fact, as you can see in the chart below, companies that consistently raise payouts have greatly outperformed the broader market over long periods. That suggests they are worth owning, no matter the interest-rate or economic environment. As interest rates rise, the market values of bonds automatically fall, so their yields match those of newly issued bonds of similar quality. Something similar happens to stocks with relatively high dividend yields. However, dividend-paying companies can offset this drag by boosting sales or earnings, propelling share prices. Also see: Follow the money — sell health-care stocks and buy dividend shares Of course, what’s most important is that a company known for a generous dividend payout doesn’t cut its dividend. That typically guts the stock price, as investors also lose income and move on to other stocks. So we have put together two lists of solid dividend payers to consider. But first, some definitions. Dividend ‘Aristocrats’ You might be familiar with the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index SPDAUDP, -0.72% which is maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices and is made up of the 50 companies in the S&P 500 SPX, -0.96% that have raised their dividends on common shares for at least 25 straight years. That’s a track record any company would be proud of, and it certainly makes management teams think twice before considering a dividend cut. Since this is the only criterion, the dividend yields aren’t necessarily very high. The idea is that consistently raising the payout might be correlated with good long-term performance. An easy way to invest in the entire index is the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF NOBL, -0.86% The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index negligibly underperformed the entire S&P 500 last year, and you can see that over the past 10 and 15 years, it has widely outperformed: Index Total return - 2016 Total return - 3 years Total return - 5 years Total return - 10 years Total return - 15 years S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats 11.8% 34.4% 97.3% 152.2% 307.1% S&P 500 12.0% 32.0% 91.6% 96.7% 172.2% Source: FactSet High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats To broaden our horizons, we’re focusing today on the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index SPHYDA, -0.67% which is also maintained by S&P Dow Jones Indices and includes the 106 components of the S&P 1500 Composite Index that have raised their dividends on common shares for at least 20 consecutive years. Since the S&P 1500 Composite Index includes the S&P 500, (along with the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index MID, -0.91%  and the S&P Small-Cap 600 SML, -0.95% ), any Dividend Aristocrat is also a high-yield dividend aristocrat. Don’t miss: This fund manager is finding profits in the wreckage of corporate Europe An easy way to invest in the entire High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index is the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, -0.67%   But you might also consider the individual stocks, especially if you want to select higher dividend payers and receive cash dividends for income, rather than reinvesting.

If you are taking the income (not reinvesting dividends), it will be gravy on top of any price appreciation. It’s interesting to see that analysts don’t rate these higher-yielding stocks very highly because analysts base their ratings on price targets. Their “buy” ratings are given to stocks only expected to rise significantly over the next 12 months, which is a short period for long-term investors.

O,"Something remarkable has happened with shares of real estate investment trusts (REITs) since Donald Trump was elected president a month ago. Even though the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.63%  has surged to about 2.40% from 1.88% on Election Day (Nov. 8), pushing up mortgage and other market rates, the S&P 500 REIT industry group has receded only 3%. “In a vacuum, higher rates by themselves would have implied a 10% correction in REIT prices,” said Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist of CenterSquare Investment Management in Plymouth Meeting, Pennsylvania, in an interview Dec. 1. “The relatively small decline is reflecting prospects of higher growth and decreasing credit spreads.” The strength in REIT stocks means investors are confident that property values and rental incomes are headed higher, Crowe said. Trump has vowed to lower taxes and focus on pro-business policies, raising expectations the economic expansion will continue — and maybe even accelerate. To help investors with research, we have put together a list of large-cap REITs with yields over 4%. Analysts expect eight of them to post double-digit gains over the next 12 months. Can Wall Street close this gender gap? It appears “higher growth,” as Crowe put it, is already upon us, considering that the latest estimate of third-quarter GDP growth is an annualized 3.2%, and that the unemployment rate hit a nine-year low of 4.6% in November. CenterSquare Investment Management Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist of CenterSquare Investment Management In the interview, Crowe discussed “a lot of good things and one bad thing” he sees for REIT investors now. On the “good” side: Movement toward fiscal stimulus as the Federal Reserve curbs its monetary stimulus. President-elect Donald Trump wants Congress to pass a major infrastructure spending bill, and Crowe believes this will increase economic growth and inflation, because direct spending by the government (rather than bond-buying by the Fed) increases demand for goods and services. Growth and inflation typically bode well for real estate prices and push rents higher, both of which are good for REITs. Less regulation of financial services. This can lead to a loosening of banks’ credit standards for mortgage loan borrowers, which can support greater demand for homes. Again, this means higher prices, which are typically good for REITs. Rising real estate prices and less stringent credit requirements mean lower credit spreads, which can lead to more borrowing and purchasing activity, which in turn supports even higher property prices. “Lenders would always rather lend against a rising asset,” Crowe said. The credit spreads he refers to are the differences between interest rates charged to borrowers and benchmark interest rates, including 10-year U.S. Treasury notes. The one bad thing is that interest rates will rise, Crowe said. But he believes “the good will outweigh the headwinds” of rising borrowing costs over the next three years. Crowe said REIT prices, excluding mortgage REITs, are trading at about “a 15% discount to NAV.” NAV stands for net asset value, and for REITs the term is defined by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (NAREIT) as the “net ‘market value’ of a company’s assets, including but not limited to its properties, after subtracting all its liabilities and obligations.” Crowe said equity REITs typically trade right around their NAVs. Of course, it’s no surprise that some groups of REITs are trading at greater discounts to net asset value than others, while some individual REITs trade for premiums. For example, troubled prison REITs were trading at a 28% discount to NAV on Dec. 2, while hotel REITs traded at a discount of only 1%, according to S&P Global. There are 27 REITs included in the S&P 500 SPX, -1.17% S&P Global was able to provide net asset values for 25 of them.

Trump has made his opinion about U.S. infrastructure clear, pointing out in a Twitter post May 13: “Our roads, airports, tunnels, bridges, electric grid [are] all falling apart.” Trump and the Republican-controlled Congress will have plenty on their plates during 2017, including a “fix,” or replacement, for the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, as well as tax reform. So it may be a tall order to sell a major infrastructure spending bill, but who can deny that Trump continues to surprise? The Dreyfus Global Infrastructure Fund isn’t set up just to “play” a possible game-changing infrastructure spending policy change in the U.S., with its largest holdings mainly in the energy and utilities sectors.

O,"Real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been lumped in with the financial sector, which hasn’t necessarily been a good thing, considering banks’ lower profits and tighter regulation since the financial meltdown in 2008. But that’s changing Thursday, when S&P Dow Jones Indices adds an 11th sector for the group, the first adjustment since 1999. The change has been in the works for some time, with S&P Dow Jones Indices making the initial announcement in November 2014 that its global industry classification standard (GICS) would include the new real estate sector. In March, David Blitzer, the managing director and chairman of the Index Committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said the change was being made to recognize “the growing importance of real estate in the world’s equity markets.” The new sector will include equity REITs. Mortgage REITs will have their own subindustry group within the financial sector. An equity REIT is a company that owns real estate for development or long-term investment, and is required to pay out at least 90% of its taxable income through dividends to shareholders. A mortgage REIT originates real estate loans or invests in mortgage-backed securities. There have traditionally been 10 sectors for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.17% S&P 400 Mid Cap MID, -1.15% and S&P Small Cap 600 SML, -1.22% indices. The S&P 500 financial sector previously included 92 companies, with 25 banks making up 46% of the sector’s market capitalization. There are 27 REITs in the S&P 500, all of which are equity REITs. Jefferies analysts Steven DeSanctis and Omotayo Okusanya in May predicted the REIT sector would outperform because of buying pressure on mutual fund managers who were “substantially underweight the sector.” However, Laszlo Birinyi, a prominent real estate investor, said this week that the new REIT sector would help the securities industry but confuse investors. Carving out a separate sector may also prompt some mutual funds or ETFs that focus on the financial sector to sell some of their REITs, which could affect shareholders of the funds who are looking for income. Still, investors may not be so easily confused. Equity REITs are nothing like banks, and have many advantages in the post-crisis, hyper-regulated environment. Splitting the equity REITs from the financial sector and into their own sector “makes a lot of sense,” said Joel Marcus, founder and CEO of Alexandria Real Estate Equities Inc. ARE, -1.71% In an interview Aug. 29, Marcus emphasized the stability of REITs, as compared to the banking industry, which “doesn’t hold hard assets” the way equity REITs do. He also said the banking sector “is a far cry” from what it was before the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers in 2008, which helped lead to much greater capital requirements, a tightening of credit standards and a clampdown on certain types of commercial lending. Alexandria Real Estate Equities was founded in 1994 and focuses on developing and owning major “urban campus” facilities for the life-sciences industry. The company’s stock is included in the S&P Mid Cap 600 Index and has a market value of $8.6 billion. The shares have a dividend yield of 2.90%. Marcus said the company is in a sweet spot, developing properties in “great locations” because of the ability of large R&D-oriented corporate tenants “to attract great talent.” Michael Binger of Gradient Investments included Alexandria Real Estate Equities among a group of six of his favorite dividend stocks he shared during an interview in May. In recent years, REIT stock prices have been sensitive to any hint of interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve, and the prolonged low-rate environment has raised valuations, as yield-hungry investors have expanded their horizons. But Marcus pointed out that the ownership of real estate has traditionally positioned REITs has hedges to inflation. Whether you agree that REITs should have their own sector, it’s happening, and the group’s profile will be raised. If you are seeking current income, you should consider REITs as part of your portfolio. How REITs have performed If you’re investing in a REIT for income, you’re obviously not going to reinvest the dividends. But to make fair comparisons, these total-return charts all assume reinvestment. The S&P 500 REIT sector has greatly outperformed the index, as well as the banking sector, over the past three years: FactSet Not only have banks faced much higher capital requirements, their dividend payouts have been capped by regulators’ annual stress tests. And their net interest margins have been compressed in the seemingly eternal low-interest-rate environment, which hurts profits. But over the past five years, which has included part of the banks’ recovery from their stocks’ low in March 2009, the banks have outperformed the index and the REITs: FactSet The picture changes completely when we look at a 10-year chart, which includes the credit crisis, with the S&P 500 outperforming the REIT sector, while bank stocks took a savage beating: FactSet Here’s one more chart — this time for 15 years, showing the REITs in a shining light: FactSet Highest-yielding S&P 500 REITs Here are the 10 S&P 500 REITs with the highest dividend yields. We have also included their FFO yields, which can help show how well each company is covering its dividend with cash flow. REIT Ticker Dividend yield - Aug. 30 FFO yield - past 12 months HCP Inc.

DLR, -1.99% 3.55% 11.19% Source: FactSet FFO stands for funds from operations, which is a non-GAAP measure used in the REIT industry to provide an estimate of cash flow available for dividend payouts. FFO adds depreciation and amortization to earnings, while subtracting gains from the sale of real estate. The FFO yield is each company’s past 12 months’ FFO divided by its closing share price on Aug. 30. For Weyerhaeuser Co. WY, +0.03% we have included the free cash flow yield for the past 12 months, as calculated by FactSet, in the table, because the company does not report FFO. Free cash flow is a company’s remaining cash flow after planned capital investments. This is money that is available to pay dividends, repurchase shares or for other corporate purposes. A 12-month FFO yield (or free cash flow yield) that is less than the current dividend yield doesn’t necessarily mean a dividend cut is forthcoming. But if the trend continues for an extended period, the chances of that happening rises. If you’re interested in any of the stocks listed here, you should do your own research into company strategy and performance, preferably with the assistance of your broker or adviser. Then if you decide to invest, it’s best to have clear objectives and be prepared for a long-term commitment to fulfill them. More from MarketWatch We are sorry, we are unable to load this video.

O,"Have you had enough negativity this year over the world economy, the U.S. stock market and the presidential election? Here’s some relief. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -2.19% CEO Warren Buffett struck a cheerful tone Saturday in his annual letter to shareholders. He said the “all-powerful trend” for increased productivity in the U.S. “is certain to continue: America’s economic magic remains alive and well.” And even sluggish economic growth can deliver “astounding gains,” he said. Money manager Cullen Roche rounded up other positive statements from Buffett from 2015 and recent years, saying “the greatest wealth accumulator in the world reminds us that these fears are unfounded, yet the message falls on deaf ears.” Read: Here’s how Warren Buffett’s ‘Dividend Aristocrats’ have performed Investors who are jolted by daily headlines might remember Buffett’s favored time line for investing: forever. That’s how real wealth is created. And the investments to hold for a very long time tend to be rock-solid dividend payers, also a Buffett favorite. Think Coca-Cola KO, -0.68%  and Procter & Gamble Co. PG, -1.12% The Wall Street Journal pointed out Monday that the S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index has greatly outperformed the broader market this year. We thought it would be useful to put together lists of companies by different criteria to serve as a starting point for your own research into dividend stocks. Also see: Income investors are leaving money on the table if they don’t use this easy options strategy When setting out, it’s important to understand that these are long-term investments. That means a commitment of several years. If your objective is income, you will find plenty of attractive yields among the Aristocrats. If your objective is long-term growth, with a conservative outlook, you will also see that, historically, the Aristocrats have done well. Identifying the Aristocrats S&P Dow Jones Indices actually maintains two indices of Dividend Aristocrats: 1. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index SPDAUDP, -1.29%  includes the 50 S&P 500 companies that have raised their regular dividend payouts for at least 25 consecutive years. That’s the only criterion. It makes no difference how high a company’s dividend yield is. An example of an ETF tracking this index is the ProShares S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats ETF NOBL, -1.64% 2. The S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index SPHYDA, -1.09%  includes components of the S&P Composite 1500 that have raised their dividends for at least 20 consecutive years. This is made up of 107 stocks, including all of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats. The SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, -1.44%  tracks the performance of this index. Here’s a comparison of total returns, with dividends reinvested, of both Aristocrats indices and the S&P 500, over the past 10 years: FactSet Here’s another way of comparing the three indices, with total returns year-to-date and 2015, along with average annual compounded returns for longer periods: Index Total return - YTD through Feb. 26 Total return - 2015 Average annual return - 3 years Average annual return - 5 years Average annual return - 10 years S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats 0.7% 0.9% 13.5%% 14.0% 9.9% S&P High-Yield Dividend Aristocrats 1.9% -0.4% 12.0% 12.1% 7.6% S&P 500 -4.3% 1.4% 11.5% 10.4% 6.5% Source: FactSet It’s fascinating to see that the more conservative S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats has greatly outperformed the High-Yield Aristocrats over longer periods, and both have outperformed the base S&P 500 by wide margins. So the ETFs might be very good long-term choices for you. Then again, if your main objective is income, and you are looking for considerably higher returns than what you would get from investment-grade bonds, individual Aristocrat stocks may be right for you.

O,"Getty Images Today we are looking at the strongest 15 stocks within the S&P 500. To calculate the strongest names, we are using a multi-factor approach, meaning technical, value and fundamental data. In our measurement we are weighing 70% to technicals, with the remaining 30% to value and fundamental factors. A multi-factor approach can work well during periods of regime change as investors favor either growth or value. For our technical factor, we purely look at momentum, long-term, medium-term and short-term trends measured by moving averages and rate of change, and apply a score. The longer-term trends are weighted the most, as these are the most important data points. The total technical score is ranked from one to 10, 10 being the best. Linked below is the iviewmarkets.com watchlist which is free to use, which provides the score of each security in the far right column. Lastly, we use MACD to make sure the shorter term momentum is favorable; this can be seen in the watch list as well. The 15 strongest stocks in the S&P The second factor is our fundamentals couple with a slight value tilt. We found the following fundamental factors coupled with our relative strength scoring to produce some of the best outcomes over a longer market cycle. The most important fundamental data point is the enterprise-to-EBITDA value. We typically want to find companies with an EV-to-EBITDA ratio less than 30. A few names will not apply, like the REITs below because of their capital structure. The next fundamental data point is a Forward P/E less than 30, which will help keep the portfolio volatility down. Return on equity greater than 7. Free-cash-flow ratio greater than 30.

O,"The seesawing stock market may finally prompt investors to dedicate more money toward high-dividend-paying companies, bonds and real estate investment trusts. After all, some form of income strategy is better for many long-term investors, even those who aren’t retired or close to retirement. There certainly is an urgency for safer investing, as there may be more trouble ahead for stocks. For one, companies have lowered earnings estimates for the second half of the year. And a range of other worries — China’s slowing economy, rising official interest rates by the Federal Reserve — are weighing on investors’ minds. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 Index SPX, -1.71%  rallied 3.9%, the biggest gain in four years, putting an end to an 11% decline in the six days through Tuesday. Stocks rose again in early trading Thursday. Among the benchmark S&P 500, 486 companies had reported earnings results for the most recent quarter (through Tuesday). While many sectors posted impressive earnings-per-share growth, most are lower than they were a year earlier. And the pace of profit growth for the second half of the year may slow considerably, based on companies’ lowering of guidance. Here are the S&P 500’s 10 sectors sorted by EPS growth rates for the most recent quarter: S&P 500 sector Second-quarter EPS growth rate Year-earlier EPS growth rate Health Care 14.70% 16.95% Telecommunication Services 11.84% 30.32% Consumer Discretionary 10.67% 10.55% Financials 9.64% -0.49% Materials 7.76% 15.80% Information Technology 6.09% 10.86% Utilities 4.45% 3.51% Consumer Staples 1.44% 7.61% Industrials -0.17% 13.25% Energy -55.76% 16.60% S&P 500 0.10% 10.49% Source: S&P Capital IQ The energy sector is dragging down the index, and seven of 10 sectors are showing slower EPS growth. How much have you been affected by the equity market turmoil over the past week? For many long-term investors, it hasn’t really been a problem because they expect history to repeat itself with a recovery for stocks. Or they may rest easy because they know that during a down market, contributions to 401(k) or similar retirement plans that are invested in stock mutual funds will be going in at lower prices. That can be a very good thing if you have an investment horizon that stretches for decades. But do you worry every day? If so, maybe you should focus some or even most of your investment efforts on income rather than growth. A constant stream of investment income can make it much easier to sleep at night. With enough income, you can fund new investments to generate even more income and grow your pot of gold in a lower-risk way than you would with a stock portfolio. Your returns over long periods are likely to be lower, but you may rest easier. The income approach may not be for everyone. Most long-term investors are likely to be better off in broad index funds, assuming that events such as those we have seen over the past week will not cause them to sell in a down market. Even with an income approach, there will still be volatility. If you invest in a bond fund, you might get a decent yield and enjoy the monthly dividend payments, but you will also be dealing with fluctuating share prices. Market prices for bonds decline when interest rates rise, and short-term rates in the U.S. have been near zero since late 2008. The Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising short-term rates this year. While we cannot say how rapidly long-term interest rates will rise, it does seem that prices for long-term bond funds will be declining. And there’s no guarantee that your losses in a bond fund will be made up when rates fall again. You can focus on bond funds with shorter durations (and lower yields) to limit volatility risk. Then, if you are willing to take more credit risk, you can consider high-yield, or non-investment-grade (“junk”) bond funds. One example in that category is the RiverPark Strategic Income Fund RSIVX, -0.32% which we reviewed in July.  But there’s more you can do to worry less about volatility. Hold your own paper If you own your own bonds, you can avoid the daily stress of fluctuating share prices — and also mutual fund management fees. That assumes the bonds don’t default, of course. If a bond was issued when interest rates were higher than they are now, you may be paying a premium to buy it, which will lower your yield to maturity. Your broker can help you make the appropriate calculations to make a decision. For example, if a bond with a face value of $10,000 is trading at a 5% premium, you will pay $10,500 for the bond and only receive $10,000 when the bond matures. You might find that the yield is high enough to make it worth taking that loss. You might also be able to buy newly issued bonds at par value through your broker. Whether you pay par, a premium or a discounted price, you will eventually be repaid the face value, no matter how much the market value of the security fluctuates each day. By holding the bond until maturity, you will not be tempted or burdened by daily price quotes. Depending on your marginal tax rate and how high your state income taxes are, you may also find municipal bonds worth a look, since they are exempt from federal income taxes and from state and local taxes, if the bond was issued in your state. Of course, bond rates are pretty low. The yield to maturity for the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Bond Index is 3.45%. With bond rates so low for so long, you might need to be more aggressive when considering higher-yielding asset classes. Preferred stock Preferred stocks are different from common stocks in that shareholders have no voting rights. But preferred stocks have a stated dividend rate, with a par value, just like bonds. Many also have call dates. A call date is similar to a maturity date, except that the issuer has the option of buying back the stock at that time. Just as you would for a bond, you need to calculate the market yield for a preferred stock you are considering. For example, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -1.52%  non-cumulative perpetual preferred series Y shares trade under the ticker JPM-F, have a $25 par value, a dividend rate of 6.13% and a call date of March 2, 2020. The shares traded for a discount, having closed at $24.84 on Tuesday. Non-cumulative means if the company suspends the dividend, and then resumes paying, it will not have to make up any dividend payments that were missed. The annual dividend payments on this preferred stock total $1.53125 a share, so the current yield, based on Tuesday’s closing price, is 6.16%. The yield to call, which reflects the current discount and the fact that you will be paid the face value of the shares if the company redeems the stock, is 6.29%. When you buy preferred shares in the open market, you pay a commission to your broker (which you might be able to negotiate lower, if you have a full-service broker), and pay a premium or get the shares for a discount. But you may also have the opportunity to buy newly issued preferred shares “off the shelf,” with no commission, if your broker participates in the underwriting. Talk to your broker.

O,"After a solid start to the year — and a torrid 2014 — REITs have really stumbled of late. With bond yields rebounding off of their lows and with Fed Chair Janet Yellen slowly moving in the direction of raising short-term rates, investors seem to be having second thoughts about the sector. Their fears aren't completely unwarranted. Higher bond yields should, all else equal, push down the prices of bond substitutes like high-dividend REITs. So, if you're buying REITs today, you have to have a fairly benign forecast for bond yields. In my Dividend Growth model, about 25% of the portfolio is invested in equity REITs, so this is not a hypothetical question for me. As an outsized portfolio position, as go REITs, so goes my Dividend Growth model. Let me be clear: I do not see Janet Yellen raising short-term rates more than 0.25% to 0.50% over the next 12 months. In fact, even a modest hike may be too ambitious unless the economy perks up. Consumer spending has sagged for two consecutive months, and lower gasoline prices have yet to translate into higher consumer spending. The core inflation measure that the Fed tracks, which excludes energy and food, is up about 1.3% in the 12 months through January. That's significantly below the Fed's 2% target. Unless something fundamentally changes in the next few months, Yellen will err on the side of keeping rates low. Meanwhile, I think we've already seen the big move in longer-term Treasury yields for the year. The 10-year yield might drift to 2.4%-2.6% by the fourth quarter. But I don't expect it to push past 3.0%-3.2% for the remainder of this decade. High demand for fixed income from retiring boomers and from foreigners escaping even lower yields at home should keep a lid on yields for a long time to come. Bottom line, the big upward move across the yield curve that REIT investors dread is still several years away. And the good news here is that, despite the run up in REIT prices last year, we still have a moderate margin of safety in place. The FTSE NAREIT All Equity REITs index, a broad benchmark used to track the REIT sector, sported a dividend yield of 3.41% as of the end of February. That looks low relative to the 7%-8% yields that were typical in the 1980s and 1990s, but it's about on par with the average yields that have prevailed since 2006, excluding the October 2008-March 2009 crisis-induced yield spike. And the spread above the 10-year Treasury yield, at 1.4%, is not out of line with the average of the past decade. And most importantly, REITs — unlike bonds — do not have fixed payouts. If managed well, their dividends grow over time. Let's consider Realty Income O, -1.01%   the blue chip of the triple-net REIT space and one of the Dividend Growth model's longest-held holdings. Over the past 10 years, Realty Income has raised its dividend at a 5% annual clip. That's very solid for a company whose business model is about as exciting as watching an English cricket match on TV. But the consistency goes beyond that. With its most recent dividend hike in January, Realty Income has boosted its monthly dividend 79 times in the past 20 years and in 70 consecutive quarters. And as a result, Realty Income was rewarded with membership in the exclusive S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats Index. As much as I like Realty Income as a long-term holding, there is a price at which I would no longer be interested. If Realty Income's yield dropped below 4%, I would stop buying new shares, and if it dropped much below that I would consider selling and taking profits. But at today's current yield — 4.5% — I still consider Realty Income an exceptionally attractive holding in a diversified income portfolio. Disclosures: Sizemore is long O.

O,"""Sell in May"" would have been bad advice for stock investors in 2013. The S&P 500 tacked on over 2% in the month, even if the last week and a half was a little rough. But investors in REITs and MLPs — which until recently were some of the best-performing assets — have suffered something of a bloodletting. The MLP sector, as measured by the JP Morgan Alerian MLP ETN AMJ, +0.00%  was down 5% from its May 20 close through the end of May, and REITs, as measured by the Vanguard REIT ETF VNQ, -1.23% were down more than 8% in that period. Looking at individual securities, the numbers get worse. Realty Income O, -0.95% National Retail Properties NNN, -1.60% and Retail Opportunities Investment Corp ROIC, -1.47%  — three REITs I hold in my Dividend Growth portfolio — were down 17%, 14% and 10%, respectively, for this period. Martin Midstream MMLP, -1.04% a high-yielding MLP I hold in the same portfolio, was down by just under 10%. June hasn't brought relief for the REIT and MLP sectors. And utilities, telecoms and other so-called ""defensive sector"" stocks have also taken heavy losses. For stocks that were often purchased precisely for their potentially low-volatility and high-income properties, it's frustrating to see that much value evaporate lately, particularly when the broader market is holding up well. But as investors, it doesn't do us a lot of good to dwell on our frustrations. We have to look forward and allocate our capital based on the options in front of us. So, what are our options? Is the bull market in dividend-paying stocks over? I personally don't believe so. As asset classes, REITs, MLPs and other income-oriented investments have outperformed the market in recent months, and they were probably due for a much-needed correction. ""Boring"" sectors cannot lead a broad bull market forever; eventually the cyclical, economically sensitive need to take leadership. And that is what appears to be happening today. Daimler DDAIF, -1.44%  and Cummins CMI, -2.09% two industrial stocks held in some of my more aggressive portfolios, have been performing well, as have my Big Tech dividend payers Intel INTC, -3.04% Microsoft MSFT, -2.21%  and Cisco Systems CSCO, -3.02% For the remainder of 2013, I see these stocks being in a sweet spot for investors. All are dividend-paying stocks, yet I believe all should also benefit from a potential rotation from defensive sectors to growth sectors. And what about REITs and MLPs? I'm not quite ready to give up on those just yet. I believe the recent selloff was due to fears that the Fed would be unwinding its quantitative easing programs, and that bond yields would soar as a result. But as the experience of Japan has proven, during a prolonged period of deleveraging, bond yields can stay much lower for much longer than most investors expect. Could the 10-year Treasury rise to, say, 2.5%-3.0% over the course of the next 12-18 months? Absolutely. But I would consider that the high-end of a long range that I expect to persist for the remainder of this decade. In the meantime, both REITs and MLPs stand to benefit from durable trends that I personally believe should continue irrespective of what the Fed does. The American property market continues to heal, and the domestic energy boom continues to provide ample demand for pipeline assets. Under even modest expectations, I believe REITs and MLPs should be able to grow their cash distributions at a rate well in excess of inflation. For our portfolios for the rest of 2013, we're planning to overweight cyclical dividend payers, particularly those in the tech sector. But we're making sure to save room for REITs and MLPs and are prepared to buy on any continued weakness. This commentary does not constitute individualized investment advice.

O,"Sony Corp. (6758.TO) is planning to unveil its next-generation home videogame console during a February event, showing off the highly-anticipated successor to its current PlayStation 3 system. The Japanese electronics giant Thursday unveiled plans for a special PlayStation-themed event set for Feb. 20, teasing fans to ""see the future"" at the event. People familiar with the matter have said the new device will make its debut there, beating Microsoft Corp. to the punch in announcing its own next-generation game machine. Sony's device will be released later this year, these people said, and will spar against Microsoft's own machine, which is also expected to be released by the holidays. Sony's updated console's arrival comes as the console videogame industry has entered a tailspin. Sales of new videogames, consoles and accessories at U.S. retail shops fell 22% in December when compared with the same time a year prior, according to surveys by industry watcher NPD Group.

O,"-- Olam shares recover in Singapore -- Muddy Waters issues letter to Olam CEO and board (Recasts throughout.) SINGAPORE--Olam International Ltd.'s (O32.SG) shares rebounded Wednesday, after the commodities firm defended its accounting following questions raised by short-seller Carson Block. Shares of one of the world's leading agribusiness companies, which fell 7.5% Tuesday, were up 5% at 1.69 Singapore dollars (US$1.38) at 0325 GMT. Its American Depositary Receipts rebounded 19% to US$26.00 Tuesday after falling more than 20% Monday. Olam, which listed in Singapore in 2005, is among the 40 largest listed companies in Singapore in terms of market capitalization. The company supplies 20 agricultural commodities, including cocoa, coffee, cotton and timber. Mr. Block, founder of Muddy Waters, told an investment conference in London on Monday he was betting against Olam. Olam fired back against Mr. Block's ""negative comments"" on Tuesday, with two statements to the Singapore stock exchange and a conference call with analysts and the media to defend its accounting methods and explain apparently high debt levels. Later Tuesday, Muddy Waters Research also stood by its founder's comments in a letter addressed to Olam Chief Executive Sunny Verghese and its board members. ""We also note Olam's attempts to impugn our credibility. You and your investors should note that attempting to silence critics is not a plan of corrective action,"" the letter stated. ""Our research into Olam has been exhaustive, and we plan to resolutely stand by it."" Aditya Renjen, the general manager for investor relations at Olam said Wednesday there was nothing substantive in the Muddy Waters note. ""We are very clear that we will defend whatever allegations that are levelled against us,"" he said. Olam is awaiting a detailed report from Muddy Waters before it comments further, Mr. Renjen said. Olam's debt totaled 8.4 billion Singapore dollars (US$6.9 billion) in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, a 12% increase from the fourth quarter's S$7.5 billion and more than quadruple the S$1.9 billion in 2007. Ernst & Young Singapore, Olam's auditor, confirmed late Tuesday that the Singapore company was a client but declined to comment further.

O,"Realty Income Corp. O agreed to buy American Realty Capital Trust Inc. ARCT for roughly $1.93 billion as the real-estate investment trust looks to diversify its portfolio outside the retail industry. Shareholders will get about 0.29 Realty Income share for each share of American Realty, valuing the company at $12.21 a share, a 2.1% premium over Wednesday's close. Upon the deal's close, American Realty shareholders will hold about 26% of Realty Income's shares. American Realty's shares were halted premarket. ""This acquisition comprehensively advances Realty Income's strategic objectives of increasing its revenue generated by investment grade tenants and further diversifying its portfolio outside of the retail industry,"" Realty Income Chief Executive Tom A. Lewis said. Realty Income will finance the deal by issuing $1.9 billion of its stock to American Realty shareholders, assuming about $526 million of debt, and repaying about $574 million of outstanding debt and transaction expenses. Realty Income said the transaction is immediately accretive and is expected to generate about 20 cents to 22 cents a share in additional funds from operations annually and, upon closing, will allow the company to increase its annual dividends to shareholders by about 13 cents a share to an annual rate of about $1.94 a share. With this acquisition, Realty Income will add 501 properties to its portfolio, increasing the total number to over 3,250 properties owned under long-term leases to major commercial and retail tenants. The deal is expected to close during the fourth quarter of this year or early in the first quarter of next. In July, American Realty said it swung to a second-quarter profit as rental income surged. Also in July, Realty Income said its second-quarter income had jumped 11% as revenue climbed. Earlier this year, Realty Income revealed that it had invested $1 billion in 164 properties in 2011.

The offer comes about three weeks after the cosmetics and skin-care company agreed to be taken private by private equity firm Swander Pace Capital in a deal that values it at roughly $65 million. Physicians Formula's new suitor has offered to acquire it for $4.90 a share, a 33% premium over its closing price on Aug. 14. Swander Pace's $4.25 a share offer was revealed on Aug. 15. Under its Physicians Formula brand name, launched in 1937, the company markets premium-priced cosmetics products for the mass-market channel. The company says it differentiates itself by addressing skin imperfections through a problem-solving approach, rather than focusing on changing fashion trends. Its products are sold in over 25,000 stores including those operated by Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -3.41% Target Corp. TGT, -1.99% and drugstores. On Thursday, Physicians Formula said it is continuing to engage in discussions and negotiations with the third party who submitted the acquisition proposal. It noted it hasn't changed its recommendations with respect to the its pending deal with Swander as the third party offer is still uncertain. Its board is continuing to evaluate the new proposal.

O,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Josh Peters, editor of the Morningstar DividendInvestor newsletter, says investors in dividend-paying stocks that are taking a beating on the market need to see whether the dividend payouts are showing signs of strength and rebound -- making a stock a bargain -- or whether they are warning investors that the shares are due for a collapse. In a radio interview with Chuck Jaffe, MarketWatch senior columnist, Peters focused on several financial stocks. Peters said the ""market is selling everything indiscriminately, and is selling good and bad companies alike,"" creating some opportunities for investors who manage to avoid the landmines. While Morningstar's quantitative analysis considers CapitalSource CSE, -4.00% to be ""distressed,"" Peters said the company is a strong buy due to a double-digit yield that he believes is safe going forward. By comparison, Peters put a sell on Alesco Financial AFN, -1.79% saying that with its yield up past 40% ""the market is telling you that the dividend is going to be cut. A 40% yield ... the market has thrown in the towel on that name,"" Peters said. During his appearance on Jaffe's show, Peters also put a buy recommendation on Realty Income O, -0.72% and suggested that investors hold ProLogis Trust PLD, -2.56% Amerigon ARGN and Landauer LDR, +0.00% noting that the latter two names are both cases where an investor might buy the stock if it gets pushed down to a more attractive entry point. In another interview from Your Money Radio, Charles Rotblut, senior market analyst for Zacks.com, made Nvidia Corp. NVDA, -4.06% the ""Bull of the Week,"" noting that the leading maker of graphic processing units is positioned for a significant run up; Zacks Investment Research has a six-month target price on the stock of $40 per share, up 45% from Wednesday's close. Rotblut tagged Highwoods Properties HIW, -1.62% as the ""Bear of the Week,"" noting that the office-property firm is not generating enough money from operations to fully cover its dividend, which may not force a dividend cut but which will preclude higher payouts in the future. Rotblut said his firm's target on the stock is $24 per share, down more than 10% from Wednesday's close. Listen to the highlights of Your Money with Chuck Jaffe.

O,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Saying the five-year rally in the real-estate sector has peaked, Banc of America Securities on Tuesday downgraded the sector and said it will most likely fall next year. ""We believe several of the catalysts which have been responsible for the strength of the REIT market seemed poised to moderate at best, or vanish at worst in 2005,"" analyst Ross Nussbaum told clients in a note. The analyst downgraded seven real estate investment trusts. He cut American Financial Realty Trust AFR, +4.19% to ""neutral"" from ""buy""; CenterPoint Properties Trust CNT, +0.00% to ""sell"" from ""neutral""; Essex Property Trust ESS, -1.69% to ""sell"" from ""neutral""; Kilroy Realty Corp.

Shares of American Financial Realty Trust fell 4 cents to $14.50, CenterPoint Properties Trust slipped 51 cents to $46.33, Essex Property Trust slid $1.42 to $79.52, Kilroy Realty Corp. dropped 24 cents to $39.76, Realty Income Corp. rose 1 cent to $47.71, Parkway Properties dropped 31 cents to $50.31 and Weingarten Realty Investors fell 40 cents to $36.89. Nussbaum said he didn't expect a sharp ""April-like"" sell-off. ""Rather,"" he said, ""we are looking for a modest, gradual pullback with continued volatility."" Nussbaum said he believed the market may turn somewhat less defensive with the uncertainty of the elections now removed. ""We believe investors will become more growth-oriented, which could cause funds to flow away from REITs,"" said Nussbaum. Nussbaum also cited the fact that the performance of REITs over the past years has led to an influx of funds into the sector. As other investing alternatives emerge, he added, the sector could see funds slow or even reverse. This could accelerate if long-term interest rates rise. Real estate will not be affected the same. Commercial real estate has benefited from a cyclical series of revaluations and is therefore vulnerable to a decline or stagnation. Consequently, Nussbaum recommends underweighting office and shopping centers and overweighting multifamily, industrial and self-storage properties.

O,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- J.P. Morgan analysts took sell-side center stage Wednesday, weighing in with some of the day's most influential calls -- shifting its focus on real-estate stocks and boosting Coca-Cola Co. Indeed, four of the real-estate equities upgraded by analyst Anthony Paolone lifted to new 52-week highs, while soft-drink giant Coca-Cola moved higher after John Faucher raised his rating on the shares in the aftermath of an earnings report from Coke's largest affiliated bottler, Coca Cola Enterprises. Going positive on office REITs Recommending that investors start to focus on property types with more leverage to the economy, Paolone told clients he now views real-estate investment trusts, or REITs, oriented toward office buildings as the most compelling investment opportunity in the REIT universe. ""The defensive card has largely been played out,"" said Paolone, referring to strip centers and triple net lease REITs, which have had a strong run for three years due to robust capital flows and a search for yield and earnings visibility. Now, the analyst says, the move is away from protecting downside during tough times to maximizing upside in a recovery. ""We are starting to see early signs of an improving job situation and a more robust stock market. Combining these factors with discounted valuations for office REIT stocks, we are compelled to start taking on a more offensive posture toward picking REITs,"" Paolone wrote in a research note. Paolone stressed, however, that he doesn't expect underlying office fundamentals ""to turn positive on a dime"" as a good deal of excess office space still needs to be absorbed throughout the country. ""As long as the economy is on the road to recovery, office REIT stocks should start to factor in future growth during 2004 even if the growth hasn't arrived yet,"" he said. Paolone noted that he recently also became more constructive on the apartment business and is marginally more positive on industrial real estate. He believes that the same factors that should help the office business and office REITs will also help those groups but that their stocks offer less in the way of upside because of their valuations. Against that backdrop, Paolone upgraded SL Green Realty SLG, -0.97% CarrAmerica Realty CRE, +1.96% PS Business Parks PSB, -2.45% Archstone-Smith Communities ASN, +0.00% Kimco Realty KIM, -0.14% Macerich Co. MAC, -0.70% and Equity Office Properties EOP At the same time, he downgraded Pan Pacific Retail PNP, +2.08% Regency Centers REG, -1.40% Simon Property SPG, -0.78% Acadia Realty AKR, -1.91% Equity One EQY New Plan Excel NXL Realty Income O, -0.91% and Lexington Corporate Properties LXP, -1.40% CarrAmerica, Archstone, Macerich and Equity Office all touched new highs on an intraday basis but lost ground by day's end with Macerich even dipping into the red at the close. The downgraded stocks were all moving lower. Regency was the biggest loser with a 1.3 percent loss followed by 1.1 percent drops for Acadia and Equity One and a 1 percent fall for Realty Income. Coke is it Underlying fellow analyst Faucher's bullish call on Coke was a cautious volume forecast from Coca-Cola Enterprises CCE, -1.69% ""We have been looking for a commitment from Coke for the past five years to give up volume for the sake of profit,"" Faucher told clients. ""We believe that CCE's fourth-quarter guidance is the first real indication that Coke is finally willing to step up to the plate."" Although the bottler boosted its earnings outlook for 2003, Coca-Cola Enterprises said full-year North American volume is expected to be approximately flat versus the prior year, with volume in Europe up approximately 5 percent to 6 percent. See related story. Other factors contributing to Faucher's upgrade of Coke to ""overweight"" from ""neutral"" are a likely benefit from a stronger yen and the traditional tendency of consumer staples stocks to outperform the market in the fourth quarter. ""The massive underperformance of the staples group year-to-date indicates that we should see better performance in the fourth quarter,"" Faucher said. The analyst noted, however, that the call was somewhat short-term in nature as he maintains ""serious concerns"" about the viability of the company's longer-term goals, especially given weak operating environments in North America, Japan and Germany. ""Until we get a better idea of Coke's algorithm, we believe that the market's projected 10 to 11 percent long-term EPS growth rate for Coke remains too high,"" he concluded. At the close, Coke shares were up 55 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $45.10, while Coca-Cola Enterprises added 35 cents to $20.05, good enough for a 1.8 percent gain. Media moves Worried about the slowing pace of national advertising, SoundView Technology took its recommendations on media companies Viacom VIA VIA, -1.20% and Clear Channel Communications CCU, -0.27% down to ""neutral"" from ""outperform."" Analyst Jordan Rohan also dropped his price target on both stocks to $46, down from $52 for Viacom and $50 for Clear Channel, while lowering his earnings estimates for the two broadcasters. ""While we do not dispute the slowly improving economic picture, the weakening national advertising market -- in broadcast and cable scatter and national radio -- is cause for concern that has resulted in a tempering of our advertising expectations for outperformance by Viacom,"" Rohan told clients. And, reflecting a deceleration in national pacings and continuing weakness in local sales, Rohan believes the trajectory of improvement for Clear Channel could be more gradual than investors have hoped. Clear Channel finished the day at $40.91, down 94 cents, or 2.2 percent, while Viacom fell $1.37, or 3.3 percent, to $40.25. Viacom, through its CBS subsidiary, holds a significant stake in MarketWatch.com, the publisher of this report.
