ABEO,"Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% shares rose 10% in heavy Monday morning trade after the company's cell therapy received a Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation from the Food and Drug Administration. The designation allows for accelerated approval, among other benefits. Abeona's cell therapy, EB-101, is being developed for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, a rare genetic condition with no cure that is marked by widespread blistering. The condition makes it difficult for patients to eat and can lead to vision loss, disfigurement and aggressive skin cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health. EB-101 aims to re-engineer a patient's cells to produce collagen, helping reduce blistering and improve healing, Abeona said. The company plans to begin a phase 3 trial for the cell therapy later this year. Company shares have risen 3.5% over the last three months, compared with a 11.3% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% and a 13.6% rise in the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%","Jan 29, 2018 9:45 a.m. ET",2,UPDATE: Abeona shares rise 10% on 'regenerative medicine advanced therapy' designation from FDA,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/abeona-shares-rise-5-on-regenerative-medicine-advanced-therapy-designation-from-fda-2018-01-29

ABEO,"(Corrects story to say Abeona has clinical-stage gene therapies, not an IBS drug therapy.) Three biotechnology companies and a health-care services company top our list of stocks to watch today because of strong technical momentum and positive news. Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% spiked 7%, or $1.20, on Tuesday, closing at $17.90 on very heavy volume of 3.9 million shares traded. Price had hit $23 on Oct. 11 and came back down to support near $16 two days later, but it bounced back up Tuesday on news of the company’s next public stock offering. There had also been positive clinical trial news on Monday regarding its clinical-stage gene therapies, the latest in a line of positive earnings and Food and Drug Administration announcements this quarter. The stock has increased by 280% since June 16. If the stock closes above $19.25, that could open the door to the next target at $22.75. Ignyta Inc. US:RXDX also popped 7%, or 95 cents, closing at $14.35 on heavy volume of 1.4 million shares traded. The move came on news of both positive clinical trial results and an announcement from the European Medicines Agency that it has given special designation and support to the company’s tumor drug. The stock has been on a strong march up since it broke above its bull wedge consolidation pattern Oct. 2, when the biotech company had announced positive drug data. There is significant lateral resistance around $15, notable because price could not persist above $15 the last time it was this high in December 2015. Beyond that, the rising channel top points to the potential of $22-$24. Spectrum Pharmaceuticals Inc. SPPI, -1.83%  broke out above a bull flag consolidation pattern on Tuesday, gaining 52 cents and closing at $14.46 on 1.7 million shares traded. The move came on news that positive clinical study data will be presented before market open on Wednesday by doctors from the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Next target: $18. Short interest of 11 times its average volume could fuel the move as shorts cover on a rally. Teladoc Inc. TDOC, +2.94% moved up $1.30 and closed at $34 on 1 million shares traded and no news from the company. There have been two encouraging tests of the present price channel. The stock came down hard into $30.80 on Sept. 21, but stayed above its long-term trendline up. A retest of the bottom of the channel occurred Monday and price still held its ground. Simultaneously, price has been coiling in a bull wedge consolidation pattern since the end of June. If the tele-health stock closes above $35, price could run to $37.50. Short interest of 17 times its average volume could fuel the move as shorts cover on a rally. See Harry’s video-chart analysis on these stocks.

However, some of the punch has been taken out of it. Not only have a couple of sell signals arrived, but the momentum is slowing. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%   touched its rising 20-day moving average on Wednesday for the first time since Sept. 5, although it hasn’t closed below that moving average. Furthermore, the “modified Bollinger Band” (mBB) sell signal has finally occurred. SPX had closed above the 4σBand for 15 straight trading days — the second-longest such streak in history. Wednesday it closed below the +3σ Band, and that activates the sell signal. The last mBB signal was a sell signal back on March 1. At that time, the market backed off modestly for about 6 weeks. The sell signal prior to that (not shown on the accompanying charts) was in December 2016; the market merely went sideways for about six weeks after that one. To continue reading, please subscribe.

ABEO,"A semiconductor and two data-storage and management companies top our list of four stocks to watch today due to technical breakouts. Diodes Inc. DIOD, +0.00% gained 77 cents and closed at $31.70 Tuesday on heavy volume of 473,900 shares traded and no news from the company. Price broke above the top of a five-day bull flag pattern that had formed at the $31 resistance level, continuing up the rising channel that began in August of last year. The next target zone is $34.50-$35, which is at the all-time high of the semiconductor device stock from October 2007. Nutanix Inc. NTNX, +2.44% soared on analyst enthusiasm, jumping $2.30, or nearly 10%, to close at $25.61 on huge volume of 15.5 million shares traded. The cloud OS stock broke out of a nearly three-month consolidation formed in the $20-$25 zone. Having now closed above resistance formed at the Sept. 22 high of $24.97, price may now be filling the significant gap created at earnings on March 3. Next targets are at $28 and $32. Pure Storage Inc. PSTG, +2.94% rose 57 cents and closed at $15.82 on just under 1.2 million shares traded and no news from the company. Price has been forming a bull wedge consolidation pattern over the past few weeks and has held support in the $15.15 zone from the prior high. If price closes above $16.35, the technology stock may well move up toward its next target at $18. Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% the lone biotech stock to watch today, broke through prior resistance at $18.90 on Tuesday and sailed up 14%, or $2.45, closing at $19.95 on heavy volume of 2.4 million shares traded. Worth noting: The technical angle of price as it has ascended shows that its trajectory up the chart has accelerated. That action, coupled with large volume on a breakout day, provides good reason to watch this stock closely. The gene-therapy company has had an amazing run recently, enjoying positive market reactions to its Aug. 22 earnings announcement, FDA news and clinical trials data. Next targets: $23 and $28.

Several new buy signals were generated late last week, but they have come under heavy pressure with the large selloff on Tuesday, the first trading day after Labor Day. So far, they have held their ground, as you shall see. One of the more important developments late last week was a breakout by the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  over the downtrend line that had been in force. The downtrend line is the descending blue line on the accompanying chart. A move above there altered the SPX chart from “correction mode” to “bullish mode,” in my opinion. In retrospect, that might be too much of a reach, for if one looks at the horizontal red lines on the SPX chart, it can also be interpreted that it is merely still within the 2400-2480 trading range. In any case, the SPX chart is no longer negative. Equity-only put-call ratios recently peaked and began to decline. The standard ratio is clearly on a buy signal. The weighted ratio appears to also be on a buy signal, according to the naked eye. But the computer analysis programs still say it has more than a minimal chance of moving to new relative highs. Hence it is still on a “sell” signal, according to those programs. I have marked the recent top as “B?,” indicating that what looks like a buy signal might not prove to be.

ABEO,"Our top charts to watch today all feature biotech stocks moving on strong technicals and news. Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% rocketed $1.75, or 18%, to close at $11.25 on heavy volume of 2.7 million shares traded Tuesday. The move came on news that the FDA granted breakthrough therapy status to the company’s skin-healing therapy. The stock had been pulling back in a flag pattern after its July high at $10.26, and recently broke out of the flag, with Tuesday’s move thrusting the stock through that July high. In the short term, price may reach $14-$15, and may well climb to $17.50 in the longer term. Short interest of 10.8 times its average volume could fuel the move as shorts cover on a rally. Corcept Therapeutics Inc. CORT, +3.46% rose 41 cents and closed at $15.10 on 1.7 million shares traded Tuesday. The move built on Monday’s breakout of a mini-consolidation that followed the biopharma stock’s steep run-up after a strong earnings announcement on Aug. 1. If price breaks above the recent high of $15.58, it could extend up to $17 and $19 later on. ImmunoGen Inc. IMGN, -2.05% popped 17% to close at $7.58 on a whopping 12 million shares traded — more than four times its average volume and the largest volume the stock has seen since January. The move came on news that the cancer-drug company will collaborate with Jazz Pharmaceuticals on the development of blood cancer therapies. If price can move through the prior high of $8.04 from July 6, the next targets will be $9.50 and $12.50. Sangamo Therapeutics Inc. SGMO, -3.68% rose 11%, or $1.30, and closed at $12.80 on heavy volume of 3.3 million shares traded. Price broke above the prior high of $12.05 from Aug. 14. The gene-therapy company recently began a clinical trial with Pfizer PFE, +0.54%  for a hemophilia treatment. Price is up 250% this year. The near-term target is $13 and the possibility for acceleration up to $17 in the coming weeks. See Harry’s video-chart analysis on these stocks.

ABEO,"NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, Mar 15, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases, announced today that the FDA has granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation for the ABO-202 program (AAV-CLN1), an AAV-based gene therapy for the treatment of CLN1 disease (infantile and late infantile onset Batten disease). A fatal lysosomal storage disease of the nervous system caused by autosomal-recessive mutations in the CLN1 gene, also known as infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, CLN1 disease is an inherited genetic disease that primarily affects the nervous system in newborns and progresses rapidly. In February 2018, the ABO-202 program was granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) by the FDA. ""This Rare Pediatric Disease designation for ABO-202 is a significant recognition of the strength of the data supporting a potential treatment for patients with CLN1, and is bolstered by the previous Orphan Drug designation from the FDA,"" stated Timothy J. Miller, Ph.D., President & CEO of Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ""These regulatory designations highlight the urgent need for a treatment for this devastating rare disease, and we look forward to initiating human clinical trials later this year."" The rare pediatric disease designation indicates that the FDA may give the company a priority review voucher if the drug is approved for the rare pediatric indication. That voucher could then be used by the company for another drug--any drug--to be given a priority review. A priority review mandates that the FDA will review a BLA drug submission within 6 months instead of the standard 10 months. A priority review designation is only given to a drug candidate that has demonstrated the potential to be a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness for a serious, unmet disease condition. The priority review voucher may be used by the sponsor or transferred to accelerate the review timeline of another drug candidate. About CLN1 Disease (infantile and late infantile onset): Infantile and late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis is a severe lysosomal disease caused by mutations in the CLN1 gene, which encodes the soluble lysosomal enzyme Palmitoyl-Protein-Thioesterase-1 (PPT1) and result in osmiophilic granules accumulating in lysosomes and leading to neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and death. CLN1 disease is a neurodegenerative, manifests shortly after birth, and is fatal in its classic form by 6 to 12 years of age. In the classic form, aggressive clinical features appear, including rapid speech and motor deterioration, refractory epilepsy, ataxia, myoclonus, and visual failure between the ages of 6 and 24 months. By 5 years of age, CLN1 disease patients with the classic infantile form are typically poorly responsive and are no longer communicative. These patients subsequently die in the following few years. About Abeona: Abeona Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Abeona's lead programs include EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU), an adeno-associated virus (AAV) based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB).

ABEO,"NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, Feb 12, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases, announced today that the FDA has granted Orphan Drug Designation (ODD) to its ABO-202 program (AAV-CLN1), an AAV-based gene therapy for the treatment of infantile Batten disease. A fatal lysosomal storage disease of the nervous system caused by autosomal-recessive mutations in the CLN1 gene, also known as infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL), infantile Batten disease is an inherited fatal genetic disease that primarily affects the nervous system in newborns and progresses rapidly. ""This designation builds on our clinical portfolio of AAV gene therapies that have received FDA and EMA orphan drug designations, which is an important validation of the scientific and clinical translation of these products for the severely underserved CLN1 patient population,"" stated Timothy J. Miller, Ph.D., President & CEO of Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ""The ABO-202 preclinical data from Dr. Steven Gray's lab support the clinical translation for patients with infantile Batten disease, and provide valuable insight for potentially improving efficacy using a combination of delivery routes for CNS and whole-body benefit to remove the underlying pathology associated with the disease. This designation helps advance the ABO-202 program and we look forward to initiating human clinical trials later this year."" ABO-202, developed with Steven Gray, Ph.D. and the support of The Saoirse Foundation, Taylor's Tale, Garrett the Grand Batten Fighter, Hayden's Batten Disease Foundation, and the Batten Disease Support and Research Association, is anticipated to enter clinical trials in 2018. ""ABO-202 is an AAV gene therapy that has shown promising preclinical efficacy in the INCL animal model of disease by extending survival and improving muscle function when administered early in the disease course,"" noted Steven J. Gray, Ph.D., Assistant Professor, Pediatrics and Neurology, UT Southwestern. The preclinical data were presented last week at the WORLDSymposium held in San Diego. Key findings included: CLN1 mice recapitulate the major features of the human disease manifestations; The data demonstrate that a single intrathecal (IT) injection of self-complementary adeno-associated virus 9 (scAAV9) encoding the human CLN1 gene to CLN1 mice at 1 week and 1 month (pre-symptomatic) significantly increased their survival, improved behavior and reduced motor deficits. Higher IT doses further improved these observations, suggesting that methods increasing CNS exposure may be beneficial and provided some survival and behavioral benefit to symptomatic INCL mice. A combination approach delivering ABO-202 by both intravenous and intrathecal routes of administration further increased survival efficacy 50% and improved potential treatment options for older animals with advanced disease manifestations. About Infantile Batten Disease: Infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis (INCL) is a severe lysosomal disease caused by mutations in the CLN1 gene, which encodes the soluble lysosomal enzyme Palmitoyl-Protein-Thioesterase-1 (PPT1) and result in osmiophilic granules accumulating in lysosomes and leading to neuroinflammation, neurodegeneration and death. CLN1 disease is a neurodegenerative, manifests shortly after birth, and is fatal in its classic form by 6 to 12 years of age. In the classic form, aggressive clinical features appear, including rapid speech and motor deterioration, refractory epilepsy, ataxia, myoclonus, and visual failure between the ages of 6 and 24 months. By 5 years of age, CLN1 disease patients with the classic infantile form are typically poorly responsive and are no longer communicative. These patients subsequently die in the following few years. About Orphan Drug Designation: Orphan drug designation is granted by the FDA to novel drugs or biologics that treat rare diseases or conditions affecting fewer than 200,000 patients in the U.S. The designation allows the drug developer to be eligible for a seven-year period of U.S. marketing exclusivity upon approval of the drug, as well as tax credits for clinical research costs, the ability to apply for annual grant funding, clinical trial design assistance, and the waiver of Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) filing fees.

ABEO, +5.13% a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases, today announced updated clinical data from the ongoing Phase 1/2 trial for ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), the company's investigational gene therapy for the treatment of Sanfilippo syndrome Type A (MPS IIIA), a rare autosomal-recessive lysosomal storage disease. The results demonstrate robust and durable clinical effects achieved throughout various timepoints post-administration. To date, 10 patients have been dosed with a single intravenous injection of ABO-102. Results were reported today during the WORLDSymposium for Lysosomal Diseases being held this week in San Diego, CA. ""MPS IIIA is a profound and deadly lysosomal storage disease with no approved treatments available. The encouraging clinical data reported today provide strong additional support for a whole-body treatment approach involving intravenous delivery of an AAV to drive expression of the SGSH enzyme in all organs of the body, with an emphasis on expression in the central nervous system,"" stated Kevin M. Flanigan, M.D., principal investigator of the trial, director of the Center for Gene Therapy at Nationwide Children's Hospital and professor of pediatrics and neurology at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. ""We are especially pleased to see sustained decreases in CSF heparan sulfate in all subjects post-injection, along with positive signals of neurocognitive activity in Cohorts 1 and 2."" In the trial, subjects received a single intravenous injection of ABO-102 to facilitate systemic delivery of a corrective copy of the gene associated with onset and progression of MPS IIIA. Subjects were evaluated at multiple time points post-injection for safety assessments and signals of biopotency and clinical activity. ""Results thus far from the ongoing ABO-102 clinical trial support the tolerability of a systemically delivered AAV approach for the treatment of lysosomal storage diseases,"" stated Timothy J. Miller, Ph.D., president and CEO of Abeona Therapeutics. ""The large reductions in heparan sulfate in both CSF and urine, significant organ changes and demonstration of neurocognitive benefits represent important findings that support our path to regulatory guidance later this year. Importantly, the FDA recently allowed the lowering of the enrollment age to include subjects as young as 6 months, supporting the clinical paradigm of treating subjects earlier in their disease manifestation."" Select updated data from the presentation are highlighted below, and the full presentation is available here: https://abeonatherapeutics.com/investors/ Biopotency Assessments: ABO-102 continues to demonstrate significant dose-dependent and time-dependent responses in measured biomarkers, including rapid and sustained reductions of heparan sulfate (HS), the sugar molecule that is the hallmark of MPS IIIA, in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and urine. CSF heparan sulfate: Day 180 assessment Cohort 2 (n=3) demonstrated a reduction of 57.1% +/- 7.14% Day 30 assessment Cohort 3 (n=3) demonstrated a reduction of 64.4% +/- 2.2% Urine heparan sulfate (HS): Day 30 assessment Cohort 3 (n=3) demonstrated a reduction of 91.9% +/-1.5% Cohort 2 (n=3) demonstrated a reduction of 54.0% +/- 18.0% Day 60 assessment Cohort 3 (n=4) demonstrated a reduction of 73.4% +/- 13.5% Cohort 2 (n=3) demonstrated a reduction of 65.2% +/- 5.5% Day 90 assessment Cohort 3 (n=1) demonstrated a reduction of 94.9 % Cohort 2 (n=3) demonstrated a reduction of 63.1%+/- 8.2% Day 180 assessment Cohort 2 (n=2) demonstrated a reduction of 55.0% +/- 5.0% Cohort 1 (n=2) demonstrated a reduction of 29.2% +/- 35.6% Biophysical Assessments: A separate natural history study (Truxal et. al., 2016, Mol.

ABEO,"(GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- - First-in-man AAV9-based gene therapy delivered by single intravenous injection targeting central nervous system and peripheral manifestations of MPS IIIB. - ABO-101 is well tolerated and demonstrates early biopotency signals with significant disease-specific heparan sulfate (HS) reductions in cerebral spinal fluid, urine, and plasma and greater than 300-fold increase in NAGLU enzyme activity observed in first subject at 30 days post injection. - Company plans for additional enrollments following pending review by independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, Feb. 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases, today reported preliminary 30-Day safety and biopotency signals from the first patient dosed in the company's ongoing Phase 1/2 trial for ABO-101, a gene therapy treatment for patients with MPS IIIB (Sanfilippo syndrome Type B), enrolling at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. The ABO-101 therapy involves a single intravenous injection of AAV gene therapy for subjects with MPS IIIB, a rare autosomal recessive disease causing neurocognitive decline, speech and mobility loss, and premature death. Abeona plans to enroll a total of three patients in Cohort 1 (2E13 vg/kg) before dose-escalating to the Cohort 2 dose (5E13 vg/kg). ""MPS IIIB is a devastating and progressive lysosomal storage disease with no approved treatment options. The first patient treated with ABO-101 has demonstrated that the systemic AAV gene transfer is well-tolerated, and the preliminary evidence of biopotency in the CNS and periphery is very encouraging,"" stated Kevin M. Flanigan, MD, principal investigator and Director of the Center for Gene Therapy at Nationwide Children's Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics and Neurology at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. ""We are especially pleased to see reductions in several key biopotency markers, including the reductions in cerebral spinal fluid, urine and plasma heparan sulfate and normalization of plasma NAGLU enzyme activity at days seven, 14 and 30 post-transfer."" The Phase 1/2 study is designed to evaluate safety and preliminary indications of efficacy of ABO-101 in subjects suffering from MPS IIIB. In the first patient treated in Cohort 1: -- ABO-101, at a systemic dose of 2E13 vg/kg, is well-tolerated, with no treatment related adverse events or serious adverse events (SAEs) through 30 days of follow up. -- Early biopotency signals include significant heparan sulfate (HS) reductions observed in cerebral spinal fluid (50%), urine (69%), plasma (60%) and urinary total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) (67%). - 50% decline in CSF heparan sulfate from baseline supports previous AAV9 clinical observations that ABO-101 crossed the blood brain barrier after intravenous administration. -- Normalized NAGLU enzyme activity observed represented by a greater than 300-fold increase over baseline at 30 days post administration. ""The reduction of heparan sulfate, the key biomarker of disease pathology in MPS IIIB, at 30 days post gene transfer indicates early and robust systemic delivery of ABO-101, and further supports our planned approach using intravenous delivery of ABO-101 in the treatment of Sanfilippo syndromes,"" stated Timothy J. Miller, PhD, President and CEO of Abeona Therapeutics. ""Consistent with our ongoing ABO-102 clinical trial in MPS IIIA, these findings support our plans to continue enrollment in this trial pending review by the DSMB."" Subjects in the Phase 1/2 trial receive a single, intravenous injection of ABO-101, which uses an AAV vector to introduce a corrective copy of the NAGLU gene associated with MPS IIIB disease. Subjects will be evaluated at multiple time points over the initial 30 days post-injection for safety assessments and initial signals of biopotency. Results in the first patient dosed with ABO-101 suggest strong CNS and broader systemic distribution, with the potential to reduce levels of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that represent the lysosomal storage pathology central to MPS IIIB disease progression. ABO-101 has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in the U.S., and Orphan Product Designation in both the U.S. and the European Union. About ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU): ABO-101 is Abeona's first-in-human, adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based gene therapy for MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome). Treatment involves a one-time intravenous delivery of a functioning copy of the N-acetyl-(alpha)-D-glucosaminidase (NAGLU) gene to cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs, with the aim of correcting the effects that result from the genetic aberrations that are the root cause of the disease. Following administration of a single dose in Sanfilippo preclinical animal models, ABO-101 induced cells in the CNS and peripheral organs to produce the missing NAGLU enzyme, which then restored underlying sugar (glycosaminoglycan or GAG) storage pathology to normal levels in cells. In preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in Sanfilippo syndrome animal model, ABO-101 demonstrated functional benefits that continue for months after treatment. A single dose of ABO-101 significantly restored normal cell and organ function, corrected cognitive defects, increased neuromuscular function and normalized the lifespan of animals with MPS IIIB after treatment compared to untreated control animals. These results are consistent with studies from several laboratories suggesting AAV treatment could potentially benefit patients with Sanfilippo syndrome. Safety and efficacy studies of AAV gene therapy treatments for Sanfilippo syndrome have recently been published in several peer-reviewed scientific journals. About MPS IIIB: (also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type B) is a genetic, progressive, and devastating rare lysosomal storage disease. In patients with MPS IIIB, genetic mutations result in a marked decrease in NAGLU enzyme activity, which leads to accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS) in the brain and other organs as well as progressive brain atrophy with cortical gray matter volume loss. The accumulation of abnormal HS results in neurocognitive decline, behavioral disturbances, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility, and premature death. MPS IIIB typically presents in children during the first few years of life, and 70% of patients do not reach 18 years of age. There are no approved treatments for MPS IIIB.

ABEO,"NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, Feb 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- First-in-man AAV9-based gene therapy delivered by single intravenous injection targeting central nervous system and peripheral manifestations of MPS IIIB. ABO-101 is well tolerated and demonstrates early biopotency signals with significant disease-specific heparan sulfate (HS) reductions in cerebral spinal fluid, urine, and plasma and greater than 300-fold increase in NAGLU enzyme activity observed in first subject at 30 days post injection. Company plans for additional enrollments following pending review by independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases, today reported preliminary 30-Day safety and biopotency signals from the first patient dosed in the company's ongoing Phase 1/2 trial for ABO-101, a gene therapy treatment for patients with MPS IIIB (Sanfilippo syndrome Type B), enrolling at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. The ABO-101 therapy involves a single intravenous injection of AAV gene therapy for subjects with MPS IIIB, a rare autosomal recessive disease causing neurocognitive decline, speech and mobility loss, and premature death. Abeona plans to enroll a total of three patients in Cohort 1 (2E13 vg/kg) before dose-escalating to the Cohort 2 dose (5E13 vg/kg). ""MPS IIIB is a devastating and progressive lysosomal storage disease with no approved treatment options. The first patient treated with ABO-101 has demonstrated that the systemic AAV gene transfer is well-tolerated, and the preliminary evidence of biopotency in the CNS and periphery is very encouraging,"" stated Kevin M. Flanigan, MD, principal investigator and Director of the Center for Gene Therapy at Nationwide Children's Hospital and Professor of Pediatrics and Neurology at The Ohio State University College of Medicine. ""We are especially pleased to see reductions in several key biopotency markers, including the reductions in cerebral spinal fluid, urine and plasma heparan sulfate and normalization of plasma NAGLU enzyme activity at days seven, 14 and 30 post-transfer."" The Phase 1/2 study is designed to evaluate safety and preliminary indications of efficacy of ABO-101 in subjects suffering from MPS IIIB. In the first patient treated in Cohort 1: - ABO-101, at a systemic dose of 2E13 vg/kg, is well-tolerated, with no treatment related adverse events or serious adverse events (SAEs) through 30 days of follow up. - Early biopotency signals include significant heparan sulfate (HS) reductions observed in cerebral spinal fluid (50%), urine (69%), plasma (60%) and urinary total glycosaminoglycan (GAG) (67%). 50% decline in CSF heparan sulfate from baseline supports previous AAV9 clinical observations that ABO-101 crossed the blood brain barrier after intravenous administration. - Normalized NAGLU enzyme activity observed represented by a greater than 300-fold increase over baseline at 30 days post administration. ""The reduction of heparan sulfate, the key biomarker of disease pathology in MPS IIIB, at 30 days post gene transfer indicates early and robust systemic delivery of ABO-101, and further supports our planned approach using intravenous delivery of ABO-101 in the treatment of Sanfilippo syndromes,"" stated Timothy J. Miller, PhD, President and CEO of Abeona Therapeutics. ""Consistent with our ongoing ABO-102 clinical trial in MPS IIIA, these findings support our plans to continue enrollment in this trial pending review by the DSMB."" Subjects in the Phase 1/2 trial receive a single, intravenous injection of ABO-101, which uses an AAV vector to introduce a corrective copy of the NAGLU gene associated with MPS IIIB disease. Subjects will be evaluated at multiple time points over the initial 30 days post-injection for safety assessments and initial signals of biopotency. Results in the first patient dosed with ABO-101 suggest strong CNS and broader systemic distribution, with the potential to reduce levels of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) that represent the lysosomal storage pathology central to MPS IIIB disease progression. ABO-101 has been granted Rare Pediatric Disease Designation in the U.S., and Orphan Product Designation in both the U.S. and the European Union. About ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU): ABO-101 is Abeona's first-in-human, adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based gene therapy for MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome). Treatment involves a one-time intravenous delivery of a functioning copy of the N-acetyl-a-D-glucosaminidase (NAGLU) gene to cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs, with the aim of correcting the effects that result from the genetic aberrations that are the root cause of the disease. Following administration of a single dose in Sanfilippo preclinical animal models, ABO-101 induced cells in the CNS and peripheral organs to produce the missing NAGLU enzyme, which then restored underlying sugar (glycosaminoglycan or GAG) storage pathology to normal levels in cells. In preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in Sanfilippo syndrome animal model, ABO-101 demonstrated functional benefits that continue for months after treatment. A single dose of ABO-101 significantly restored normal cell and organ function, corrected cognitive defects, increased neuromuscular function and normalized the lifespan of animals with MPS IIIB after treatment compared to untreated control animals. These results are consistent with studies from several laboratories suggesting AAV treatment could potentially benefit patients with Sanfilippo syndrome. Safety and efficacy studies of AAV gene therapy treatments for Sanfilippo syndrome have recently been published in several peer-reviewed scientific journals.

ABEO,"(GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- - First gene therapy RMAT designation for Epidermolysis Bullosa - Enables accelerated approval path and real world data usage NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, Jan. 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to EB-101, the Company's gene-corrected autologous cell therapy product for patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). ""EB-101 is an autologous gene-corrected cell therapy approach that utilizes a patient's own cells and genetically re-engineers them to produce the missing collagen protein, which helps hold skin on to the body. This reduces the number of painful blisters caused by injury and has demonstrated improved wound healing in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for over 2 years,"" said Timothy J. Miller, Ph.D., President and CEO of Abeona. ""The receipt of the RMAT and Breakthrough designations, both over the last six months, reaffirms the significance of the EB-101 clinical trial results and the need to advance promising therapies in areas of considerable unmet medical need. We are pleased that the FDA granted the RMAT designation, which will help accelerate the development of EB-101, and look forward to continuing our collaborative discussions in defining the pathway forward for the Phase 3 trial set to begin later this year."" Established under the 21st Century Cures Act, the RMAT designation is an expedited program for the advancement and approval of regenerative medicine products where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the potential to address unmet medical needs for life-threatening diseases or conditions. Similar to Breakthrough Therapy designation, the RMAT allows companies developing regenerative medicine therapies to work more closely and frequently with the FDA, and RMAT-designated products may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. In November 2017, the FDA expanded the RMAT designation for gene therapies. The sponsor of a RMAT therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may, as appropriate, fulfill such requirements through submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world data. For information on RMAT designation, visit the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ucm537670.htm The Company continues to engage the FDA on its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial design, and will provide an update on the program in the coming months. Abeona's EB-101 product is an autologous, ex-vivo gene-corrected cell therapy in which the COL7A1 gene is inserted into a patient's own skin cells (keratinocytes) for the treatment of the underlying disease in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. The EB-101 program has been granted Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Orphan Drug Designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). About EB-101: In the completed Phase 1/2 clinical trial, EB-101 was administered to non-healing chronic wounds on each subject and assessed for wound healing at predefined time points. The trial met the primary endpoints for safety and efficacy, where wound healing after EB-101 administration was compared to control untreated wounds from a supporting natural history study that evaluated 128 patients and approximately 1500 chronic and recurring RDEB wounds. Secondary endpoints included expression of collagen C7 and restoration of anchoring fibrils at three and six-months post-administration. Clinical data demonstrated that EB-101 treated wounds were significantly healed >50% for more than two years post-administration. The data included: Wound healing, defined as >50% closure after EB-101 administration, was observed in: --- 100% (42/42 treated wounds, n=7 subjects) at 3 months; --- 90% (38/42 treated wounds, n=7 subjects) at 6 months; --- 83% (20/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 12 months; --- 88% (21/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 24 months; --- 100% (6/6 treated wounds, n=1 subject) at 36 months post-administration. Collagen VII (C7) expression: C7 and morphologically normal NC2 reactive anchoring fibrils were observed as early as 1 month in EB-101 treated wounds and have remained for at least two years post-administration. Importantly, data from a supportive natural history study of approximately 1,500 wounds from 128 patients with RDEB, established by Stanford and EBCare Registry, were also presented to the FDA. Notably, 13 RDEB patients with a total of 15 chronic wounds were treated with an allograft product, including Apligraf(R) and Dermagraft(R). Of these wounds treated with allografts, only 7% (1/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 12 weeks, and 0% (0/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 24 weeks. This is a meaningful finding of the natural history study, as there are no approved therapies for RDEB patients that demonstrate significant wound closure after two months post-application.

ABEO,"NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, Jan 29, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- First gene therapy RMAT designation for Epidermolysis Bullosa Enables accelerated approval path and real world data usage Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel cell and gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases, announced today that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy (RMAT) designation to EB-101, the Company's gene-corrected autologous cell therapy product for patients with recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). ""EB-101 is an autologous gene-corrected cell therapy approach that utilizes a patient's own cells and genetically re-engineers them to produce the missing collagen protein, which helps hold skin on to the body. This reduces the number of painful blisters caused by injury and has demonstrated improved wound healing in our Phase 1/2 clinical trial for over 2 years,"" said Timothy J. Miller, Ph.D., President and CEO of Abeona. ""The receipt of the RMAT and Breakthrough designations, both over the last six months, reaffirms the significance of the EB-101 clinical trial results and the need to advance promising therapies in areas of considerable unmet medical need. We are pleased that the FDA granted the RMAT designation, which will help accelerate the development of EB-101, and look forward to continuing our collaborative discussions in defining the pathway forward for the Phase 3 trial set to begin later this year."" Established under the 21st Century Cures Act, the RMAT designation is an expedited program for the advancement and approval of regenerative medicine products where preliminary clinical evidence indicates the potential to address unmet medical needs for life-threatening diseases or conditions. Similar to Breakthrough Therapy designation, the RMAT allows companies developing regenerative medicine therapies to work more closely and frequently with the FDA, and RMAT-designated products may be eligible for priority review and accelerated approval. In November 2017, the FDA expanded the RMAT designation for gene therapies. The sponsor of a RMAT therapy that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may, as appropriate, fulfill such requirements through submission of clinical evidence, clinical studies, patient registries, or other sources of real world data. For information on RMAT designation, visit the FDA website: https://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ucm537670.htm The Company continues to engage the FDA on its pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial design, and will provide an update on the program in the coming months. Abeona's EB-101 product is an autologous, ex-vivo gene-corrected cell therapy in which the COL7A1 gene is inserted into a patient's own skin cells (keratinocytes) for the treatment of the underlying disease in Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa. The EB-101 program has been granted Breakthrough Therapy, Orphan Drug and Rare Pediatric Disease Designations from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Orphan Drug Designation from the European Medicines Agency (EMA). About EB-101: In the completed Phase 1/2 clinical trial, EB-101 was administered to non-healing chronic wounds on each subject and assessed for wound healing at predefined time points. The trial met the primary endpoints for safety and efficacy, where wound healing after EB-101 administration was compared to control untreated wounds from a supporting natural history study that evaluated 128 patients and approximately 1500 chronic and recurring RDEB wounds. Secondary endpoints included expression of collagen C7 and restoration of anchoring fibrils at three and six-months post-administration. Clinical data demonstrated that EB-101 treated wounds were significantly healed >50% for more than two years post-administration. The data included: Wound healing, defined as >50% closure after EB-101 administration, was observed in: --- 100% (42/42 treated wounds, n=7 subjects) at 3 months; --- 90% (38/42 treated wounds, n=7 subjects) at 6 months; --- 83% (20/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 12 months; --- 88% (21/24 treated wounds, n=4 subjects) at 24 months; --- 100% (6/6 treated wounds, n=1 subject) at 36 months post-administration. Collagen VII (C7) expression: C7 and morphologically normal NC2 reactive anchoring fibrils were observed as early as 1 month in EB-101 treated wounds and have remained for at least two years post-administration. Importantly, data from a supportive natural history study of approximately 1,500 wounds from 128 patients with RDEB, established by Stanford and EBCare Registry, were also presented to the FDA. Notably, 13 RDEB patients with a total of 15 chronic wounds were treated with an allograft product, including Apligraf [(R)] and Dermagraft [(R)] . Of these wounds treated with allografts, only 7% (1/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 12 weeks, and 0% (0/15 treated wounds) remained healed after 24 weeks. This is a meaningful finding of the natural history study, as there are no approved therapies for RDEB patients that demonstrate significant wound closure after two months post-application.

ABEO,"NEW YORK and CLEVELAND, Dec 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Abeona Therapeutics Inc. ABEO, +5.13% a leading clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel gene and cell therapies for life-threatening rare diseases, announced today that the first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial for ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU), a single treatment gene therapy for patients with Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB), has been dosed at Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio. ""With the dosing of the first patient with Sanfilippo syndrome type B, we are excited to begin enrolling our third gene therapy clinical trial targeting rare diseases,"" stated Timothy J. Miller, Ph.D., President and CEO of Abeona. ""Having observed positive efficacy data and a strong safety profile in our MPS IIIA program, we look forward to further validating the clinical translation of this investigational gene therapy. This trial is the culmination of many years of research and development, and none of it would have been possible without continued support from the Sanfilippo patient advocacy community."" ABO-101 has been granted Orphan Product Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and received Rare Pediatric Disease Designation as a pre-requisite component of the FDA's Priority Review Voucher process. The ABO-101 clinical study is supported by a 25-subject MPS III Natural History Study conducted at Nationwide Children's Hospital. ""MPS IIIB is a devastating and deadly lysosomal storage disease with no approved treatments available. Caused by a single gene defect, the disease afflicts children, many of whom do not reach adulthood. The ABO-101 gene therapy approach advances the potential of AAV gene therapy as a treatment paradigm for addressing this relentlessly progressive disease,"" noted Kevin M. Flanigan, M.D., Director and Principal Investigator with the Center for Gene Therapy at Nationwide Children's Hospital. About ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU): ABO-101 is Abeona's first-in-human, adeno-associated viral (AAV)-based gene therapy for MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome). Treatment involves a one-time intravenous delivery of a functioning copy of the N-acetyl-a-D-glucosaminidase (NAGLU) gene to cells of the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral organs, with the aim of correcting the effects that result from the genetic aberrations that are the root cause of the disease. Following administration of a single dose in Sanfilippo preclinical animal models, ABO-101 induced cells in the CNS and peripheral organs to produce the missing NAGLU enzyme, which then restored the underlying sugar (GAG) storage pathology to normal levels in cells. Preclinical in vivo efficacy studies in Sanfilippo syndrome animal model have demonstrated functional benefits that continue for months after treatment. A single dose of ABO-101 significantly restored normal cell and organ function, corrected cognitive defects, increased neuromuscular function and normalized the lifespan of animals with MPS IIIB after treatment compared to untreated control animals. These results are consistent with studies from several laboratories suggesting AAV treatment could potentially benefit patients with Sanfilippo syndrome. Safety and efficacy studies of AAV gene therapy treatments for Sanfilippo syndrome have recently been published in several peer-reviewed scientific journals. About MPS IIIB: (also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type B) is a genetic, progressive, and devastating rare lysosomal storage disease. In patients with MPS IIIB, genetic mutations result in a marked decrease in NAGLU enzyme activity, which leads to accumulation of heparan sulfate (HS) in the brain and other organs as well as progressive brain atrophy with cortical gray matter volume loss. The accumulation of abnormal HS results in neurocognitive decline, behavioral disturbances, speech loss, increasing loss of mobility, and premature death. MPS IIIB typically presents in children during the first few years of life, and 70% of patients do not reach 18 years of age. There are no approved treatments for MPS IIIB. About Abeona: Abeona Therapeutics Inc. is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing gene therapies for life-threatening rare genetic diseases. Abeona's lead programs include ABO-102 (AAV-SGSH), an adeno-associated virus (AAV)-based gene therapy for Sanfilippo syndrome type A (MPS IIIA) and EB-101 (gene-corrected skin grafts) for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB). Abeona is also developing ABO-101 (AAV-NAGLU) for Sanfilippo syndrome type B (MPS IIIB), ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) gene therapy for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for treatment of infantile Batten disease (INCL), EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-301 (AAV-FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using a novel CRISPR/Cas9-based gene editing approach to gene therapy for rare blood diseases.
