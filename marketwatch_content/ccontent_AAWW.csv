AAWW,"Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. accused its unionized pilots of intentionally slowing down work, causing ""widespread and significant"" flight delays, in the latest labor dispute between a union and an air-cargo carrier. The company, whose airline subsidiaries deliver cargo for United Parcel Service Inc., Deutsche Post AG's DHL, FedEx Corp. and Amazon.com Inc., is seeking a preliminary injunction to get the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to end what it calls an illegal work slowdown aimed at disrupting its business. The corporate parent of Atlas Air and Polar Air Cargo Worldwide said in prepared remarks the union is engaging in a coordinated attempt to disrupt service to gain an edge during ongoing contract negotiations. In a federal complaint filed Monday, Atlas claimed the union has encouraged such acts as calling in sick at the last minute, refusing to work citing fatigue and refusing to work overtime. The complaint said the amount of last-minute sick calls jumped to 24% between October 1, 2016, and last Wednesday, compared with 14% during the same period a year earlier. The company said tactics like these contributed to an 83% surge in flight delays over six hours since December. The dispute may stoke concerns about a potential labor impasse at the start of peak holiday shipping season. Last year, an airline operated by rival Atlas rival Air Transport Services Group Inc., successfully got a federal judge to halt a pilot strike after the work stoppage threatened to disrupt deliveries during the critical holiday season. Unionized aircraft mechanics at UPS are also threatening to strike if contract negotiations do not come to a close soon. ""We value our commitment to our customers and the passengers and cargo entrusted to us,"" said Atlas Air Worldwide Chief Executive William J. Flynn in a statement. ""We must protect the service quality we provide to our customers."" A union representative said that while the complaint is being reviewed, an initial assessment suggests ""it is part of the company's ongoing efforts to abdicate responsibility for its failures and refusal to address the long-expected decline in global pilot supply."" ""Meanwhile, Atlas has intentionally expanded its flying operations, all while pretending it has the staffing capacity to do so,"" said Daniel Wells, president of the Airline Professionals Association Teamsters Local 1224. ""It should come as no surprise therefore that Atlas's operations are now subject to criticism and scrutiny from its customers and the public."" Airlines and railroads fall under the Railway Labor Act, which makes it more difficult for unionized workers to strike. Under that law, contracts don't expire, and federal mediation is mandated if the two sides can't come to an agreement. The mediators also can call for a recess in negotiations if the two sides reach a stalemate. Shares in Atlas Air, up 27% so far this year, slipped 2.4% to $66 during Monday trading.

AAWW,"Amazon.com Inc.’s newly established in-house transportation network is facing a rocky start to its all-important holiday season. Pilots contracted to deliver Amazon packages began picketing Tuesday because of a longstanding labor dispute, a sign of further potential disruptions through the end of the year at one of Amazon’s two airline partners. The pilots are employed by Air Transport Services Group Inc. ATSG, +2.91%  , which alongside Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. AAWW, +2.03%  , was hired by Amazon AMZN, +1.11%   to fly its packages in 40 dedicated jets by the end of 2018. About 16 will be in operation by the end of the year, according to the companies. But the contracts with Amazon, which is beginning to build its own transportation network through these kinds of partnerships, have added more flights and staffing needs at ATSG and Atlas. The increased demand is upsetting pilots as they try to agree on new labor contracts with management. In a complaint filed in federal court Tuesday, ABX Air Inc., a subsidiary of ATSG, said Christmas shopping and deliveries have already been disrupted and could worsen if the industrial action continues.

AAWW,"Boeing Co. is scheduled to report third-quarter results before the market opens on Wednesday, with investors likely focused more on any commentary about the defense and aerospace giant’s outlook for the rest of the year than what it saw a month or two ago. While investors appear to be growing more optimistic, with the stock running up toward a 9 ½ month closing high in morning trade Tuesday, some analysts have expressed concern that the market for commercial widebody jets, which for Boeing include the 777 and 787 model aircrafts, has continued to act as a headwind. UBS analyst David Strauss said in a recent not to clients that “widebody demand trends have worsened” in recent months, and that he believes a 35% cut in global widebody production, as well as a 35% reduction in widebody rates, is needed to bring supply and demand back in balance. Meanwhile, here’s what analysts are expecting from Boeing’s results: Earnings: Boeing US:BA  is expected to report earnings per share of $2.61 for the quarter to Sept. 30, according to the average estimate of analysts surveyed by FactSet, up from $2.52 in the same period a year ago. The FactSet EPS consensus has declined over the last couple months, from $2.67 as of Aug. 31. FactSet Estimize, a crowdsourcing platform that gathers estimates from Wall Street analysts, as well as buy-side analysts, hedge-fund managers, company executives, academics and others, has a consensus EPS estimate of $2.66, based on 62 estimates. Boeing had reported a narrower-than-expected loss in the second quarter, after missing expectations in the first quarter. That quarterly profit miss was the first for Boeing in over four years. Revenue: The FactSet revenue consensus is $23.6 billion, below the $25.8 billion reported a year ago. On Aug. 31, the FactSet consensus was $23.7 billion. Those crowdsourced by Estimize are projecting, on average, revenue of $23.6 billion. Boeing beat the FactSet revenue consensus the last five quarters. Stock price: Despite the recent strength, Boeing’s stock has still underperformed its peers, and the broader stock market, by a wide margin so far this year. It has lost 3.9% year to date through Tuesday, while the SPDR Industrials Select Sector exchange-traded fund US:XLI  has climbed 7.4% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA  has gained 4.3%. Graphic embed is no longer available. Most analysts are bullish on the shares, with the average rating of 24 analysts surveyed by FactSet the equivalent of overweight. The average stock price target of $148.28 was 6.7% above current levels. Other issues: One area of focus for investors may be any commentary on the commercial cargo market, after chief executive Dennis Muilenburg said at an industry conference last month that the segment remains “flat” and would be a “continuing watch area,” according to a transcript provided by FactSet. Regarding the widebody market, Muilenberg said he was seeing more hesitation, as orders were flat. He said that was partially the result of declines in cargo traffic, as well as slow economic growth and political unrest globally. Earlier this month, Boeing announced a deal with Atlas Worldwide Holdings US:AAWW  to convert nine 767 widebody passenger planes into cargo freighters. This comes about five months after Atlas announced a deal to provide air cargo services to e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. US:AMZN US:AMZN Also in early October, Qatar Airways said it ordered 40 Boeing widebody jets worth $11.7 billion, and signed a letter of intent to buy up to 60 single-aisle planes worth $6.9 billion. Investors may also be keenly focused on any changes to Boeing’s financial outlook for 2016. The following table reflects the guidance Boeing provided in July.

AAWW,"The latest company to feel an ‘Amazon effect’ is not a bricks-and-mortar retailer, struggling to compete with the e-commerce giant. Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. AAWW, +2.03%  , a provider of outsourced aircraft and aviation operating services, said Wednesday that costs incurred in the quarter because of a new venture with Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +1.11%  were part of the reason its profit and revenue fell way short of estimates. Read also: Target is the latest retailer to feel the ‘Amazon effect’ In May, Atlas announced it would provide air cargo services for Amazon, helping it to build out its delivery network. The agreement included the operation of 20 Boeing Co. BA, +2.46%  767 freighters for Amazon by Atlas unit Atlas Air Inc., providing crew, maintenance and insurance, over a seven-year period. As part of their agreement and to “align interests and strengthen the long-term relationship,” Atlas granted Amazon warrants to acquire up to 20% of the company at a strike price of $37.50 a share over a period of five years. Vesting was tied to the start of the freighter program and other conditions. The company also granted Amazon warrants to buy up to an additional 10% of Atlas’s stock at the same strike price over a seven-year period, with vesting tied to payments made by Amazon. Graphic embed is no longer available. Atlas said it expects to place its first aircraft into service for Amazon this quarter. “We have secured all of the conversion slots and the vast majority of the feedstock aircraft required to support 20 B767-300s for Amazon by the end of 2018,” Chief Executive William Flynn said, according to the Atlas earnings release. However, as well as absorbing early startup costs, Atlas said it had a liability related to the Amazon warrants and said it would re-measure them at fair value for every period until they are exercised or expire in May 2021. Atlas’s stock was last trading at $37.85, down about 8% on the day. The stock’s volume-weighted average daily closing price was $42.50 during the quarter, according to FactSet data, or $5 above the strike price of the warrants. In accounting for the warrants, Atlas reported an unrealized gain of $26.5 million in the quarter and a tax expense of $8.7 million. In calculating per-share earnings for the second quarter, the airline treated the warrants as if they had been exercised upon issuance. That meant it disregarded the unrealized gain but kept the tax expense, generating a loss of 26 cents per share on income from continuing operations of $20.9 million. On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations net of taxes came to $20.2 million, or 80 cents a share, well below the FactSet consensus of 92 cents. Revenue of $443 million was 6.2% below consensus. That sent the company’s stock down 8% in midday trade. Graphic embed is no longer available. Atlas said it now expects full-year adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations to be lower than adjusted EPS in 2015 by a high-single-digit percentage. The current FactSet consensus implies a 5% decline. “We provide guidance on an adjusted basis because we are unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the effects of the warrants issued to Amazon or certain other significant items that could be material to our reported results,” said the release. Cowen analysts said the Amazon startup costs will weigh on Atlas revenue for the next few quarters, but it’s not all bad news. “This will negatively impact overall profitability,” they wrote in a note; however, “we believe the Amazon relationship will ultimately prove to be very profitable but the startup will be slightly disruptive in the near term.” More from MarketWatch Can the Democrats Ride a Blue Wave to Midterm Election Wins?

AAWW,"Amazon.com has rolled out its first branded jet, part of a cargo fleet put together to ensure speedy package delivery for its all-important Prime members. The e-commerce giant AMZN, +1.11%  introduced the plane — Amazon One — in a blog posting Thursday. The Boeing 767-300, with “Prime Air” emblazoned on its side in bright blue letters, is part of the company’s plan to support one- and two-day U.S. package delivery. Amazon expects to introduce 40 planes just like this one over the next two years, said Dave Clark, senior; vice president of world-wide operations, in the blog post. The company will show off the logo-decorated aircraft at the Seafair Air Show on Friday, and it tweeted out a video showing a time-lapse video of the plane being painted: The planes will help fulfill Amazon’s desire to reduce its reliance on carriers like United Parcel Service Inc.

This first branded jet gives a special nod to Prime members by featuring a prime number as its tail number. The company owes much to its $99-per-year Prime unlimited shopping club, which helped it deliver blowout second-quarter earnings and revenue beats in July. Revenue rose 31%, pushing Amazon to a new all-time high profit. Amazon’s second-annual Prime Day (July 12), not even included in that second quarter, resulted in a more than 60% boost in world-wide orders from last year’s event, according to the e-retailer. Research group Benchmark Co. estimated that 6 million new Prime members were added on the annual one-day sale event, which offers discounts stretching across several categories. Prime Day’s success prompted Benchmark and other analysts to lift their stock price targets and third-quarter estimates on Amazon, which is now the fourth-most valuable U.S. company.

AAWW,"Mobile Mini,Inc. Mobile Mini boosted second-quarter sales per share by 25%, and analysts forecast 34% upside for the company’s stock over the next 12 months. When Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett discussed his company’s agreement to acquire Precision Castparts, there were probably many people who read about the $32 billion transaction who weren’t familiar with the Portland, Ore.-based maker of metal parts. Let’s face it: Industrial companies don’t usually make for titillating headlines. But that doesn’t mean you shouldn’t consider them as long-term investments, especially if they have fat profit margins. Buffett didn’t follow his typical practice of discussing cash flow or other nuts-and-bolts aspects of the target company’s financial performance. When talking about Berkshire Hathaway Inc.’s BRK.B, +1.43%  decision, he said he had admired Precision Castparts Corp. US:PCP “for some time,” and that “it is the supplier of choice for the world’s aerospace industry, one of the largest sources of American exports.” That’s it. So from his limited comments, it would seem Buffett was most interested in Precision Castparts as a long-term strategic play, and not as an underpriced value. Read: Precision Castparts a ‘perfect fit’ for Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, analyst says Not a big bargain Berkshire Hathaway agreed to pay $235 a share in cash for Precision Castparts, so it was no surprise to see the shares rise 19% on Aug. 10 to close at $230.92. But if we go back one day, we see that the target company’s shares had underperformed over the previous five years. The stock was down 19% year-to-date through Aug. 7, with declining commodity prices hurting the company’s sales and profit margins. Then again, its 10-year return was very strong: Total return - YTD through Aug. 7 Total return - 3 years through Aug. 7 Total return - 5 years through Aug. 7 Total return - 10 years through Aug. 7 Precision Castparts -19% 22% 57% 332% S&P 1500 Industrials -3% 58% 97% 121% Source: FactSet Despite this year’s decline through Aug. 7, Credit Suisse analyst Stephen Levenson said shares of Precision Castparts still carried “valuation multiples at a premium of 20% or more to [its] peer group.” So it would appear that Buffet was willing to pay quite a bit for precision Castparts, even if some investors might be disappointed that the $235 takeout price was well below the stock’s 52-week high of $249.12 on Sept. 19. One reason Buffett agreed to the significant premium, according to Levenson, was its “superior operating margin.” The company’s EBITDA margin over the past four quarters has been 30.28%, the highest among the 26 aerospace and defense stocks included in the S&P Composite 1500 Index. Buffett said Berkshire wouldn’t enter into another large M&A deal for a while, since the company needs to rebuild its cash holdings, but he did say he would consider smaller acquisitions over the next six months. We thought it would be interesting to list more industrial companies with high operating margins that might be takeout targets or long-term bargains for investors.

Then again, Mobile Mini increased second-quarter sales per share by 25%, the most among this group of companies.

AAWW,"The Dow Jones Transportation Average has underperformed the broader stock market this year. And on Monday, Sterne Agee analyst Carter Worth reiterated his “sell” call for the sector. But you might still consider airline stocks, which are trading at the lowest valuations. FactSet The Dow Jones Transportation Average has underperformed the S&P 500 so far this year. The Dow Jones Transportation Average DJT, +2.05%  is down slightly this year, compared with a 3.2% return for the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38% But over longer periods, the transportation sector has greatly outperformed the broader market. Here’s the 12-month chart: FactSet Over the past 12 months, the Dow Jones Transportation Average has returned 26%, while the S&P 500 Index has returned 17%. And here’s the three-year chart: FactSet Over the past three years, the Dow Jones Transportation Average has returned 84%,while the S&P 500 Index has returned 65%. Here’s a performance summary for the Dow Jones Transportation Average and the S&P 500 Index going further back: Total return - 5 years Total return - 10 years Total return - 15 years Dow Jones Transportation Average 134% 184% 306% S&P 500 Index 107% 121% 88% Total returns assume dividends are reinvested. Source: FactSet On Monday, Sterne Agee’s Worth said “the Transports are so far ahead of the general U.S. equity market on a long-term basis (having almost doubled the performance of the S&P 500 since 1980) that the likelihood of outperforming again in 2015 is very low.” In his technical analysis, Worth said the underperformance of the Dow Jones Transportation Average over the past three months leaves it “at risk of breaking its relative strength uptrend in effect since late 2012 — the relative strength uptrend line going back to the very moment when the Transports broke out to new all-time highs in late 2012/early 2013 and proceeded to almost double in 24 months.” Over the long haul, transportation companies have, of course, benefitted tremendously from increased global trade, including China’s transformation into the world’s manufacturing center and the exponential rise in Internet-based shopping and the resulting package deliveries by United Parcel Service Inc. UPS, +1.93% FedEx Corp. FDX, +2.26%  and many other air-freight and ground-transportation service providers. The transportation group also benefitted from the 50% drop in oil prices from their peak in June through the end of the year. So it’s logical to expect the decline in production that will follow the announced investment cuts by major producers will eventually lead to rising fuel prices and pressure on the transportation sector. But is the transportation sector overvalued? Maybe not, based on fundamentals. The Dow Jones Transportation Average trades for 14.5 times consensus 2016 EPS estimates, while the S&P 500 Index trades for 15.7 times 2016 earnings estimates. Airline stocks are cheapest In addition to the 20 stocks included in the Dow Jones Transportation Average, we looked at the 33 transportation stocks included in the S&P 1500 Composite Index. There’s plenty of overlap between the two lists, so our final list included 35 companies. Among our group of 35 transportation companies, all of the stocks trading below 13 times consensus 2016 earnings estimates are airlines, which as a group have shown remarkable performance over recent years. Here are total returns for the seven airlines included among the 20 stocks making up Dow Jones Transportation Average or the transportation sector of the S&P 1500: Airline Ticker Total return - YTD Total return - 2014 Total return - 3 years Total return - 5 years Alaska Air Group Ltd.

A ratio below 1 could mean that a company is undervalued because its stock is trading below a level that would reflect the expected earnings growth rate. The airlines have staged a remarkable turnaround over recent yeas, moving past the wave of bankruptcies and mergers by cutting expenses, changing pricing schemes to include fees for all sorts of services, and more recently enjoying a dramatic fall in fuel prices. The low P/E ratios reflect investors’ continued distrust for the cyclical industry, and possibly a fear of rising fuel prices.

SkyWest showed a loss for 2014 because of a rise in operating expenses and $74.8 million in special charges, mainly related to the “accelerated removal of the EMB-120 aircraft and anticipated reduction in the future use of the ERJ145 aircraft.” So what’s next for the airlines? Their remarkable run could continue, as the U.S. economy strengthens. Meanwhile, the big threat remains rising fuel prices. If you believe that the price of oil won’t rise very much over the next few years and that the U.S. economy will continue on its upward path, the airline stocks may still be winners. But beware of the cycle. When job creation slows, it may be time to move away from the airlines.

AAWW,"Billionaire Ken Fisher 's Fisher Asset Management has recently revealed its equity portfolio as of the end of the first quarter of 2013. The fund disclosed an equity portfolio worth around $43.4 billion, basically unchanged over the quarter. The portfolio is well diversified with major stakes in the financial, services and technology companies. The two largest positions are held in an ETN and an ETF, followed by American Express Company AXP, +1.16%  , in which the fund has $987 million, and a $980 million Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55%   position. While the largest holdings from Fisher's 13F portfolio have remained almost unchanged, the fund has also revealed that it added over 50 new stocks to the portfolio. Fisher also significantly raised its exposure to several companies. In this piece, we will analyze some of the largest moves in Fisher's equity portfolio, which involve both new positions and surges in previous holdings. The fund has initiated a long position in Kate Spade & Co US:KATE  , reporting ownership of over 3.04 million shares, with a reported value of $113 million. Kate Spade & Co is a $4.30 billion company engaged in the design and marketing of a portfolio of premium brands such as Juicy Couture and Kate Spade. Its stock edged up by 6% year-to-date and trails a P/E of 56, significantly above the industry average of 31. Alexander Mitchell's Scopus Asset Management holds a significant position in the company, according to its latest 13F, which amasses around 4.25 million shares. In Heartland Payment Systems, Inc. US:HPY   the fund also initiated a stake, worth $72.5 million, which contains some 1.75 million shares. The company has recently bought MCS Software, a provider of school food service point-of-sale, back office and online payment solutions with a client base of over 4,000 K-12 schools in the U.S. Heartland Payment Systems has reported a net income of $2.32 per share, above the previous year result of $1.87, and above the analysts' estimates. Over the past 12 months the company had an Ebitda of $161 million and an EV/Ebitda of 9.6. For the current year, the company is expected to post an EPS of $2.39.

AAWW,"Biotech and technology stocks were strong on Wednesday and are among the longs we feature in our charts to watch. We also feature a few shorts. Aegerion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. US:AEGR which had a monster breakout in October, taking it about 9 points straight up in four days, has pulled back and filled in a wedge pattern over the last six weeks. The stock in the last three sessions has thrust off the bottom of the wedge near the 50-day rising moving average with increasing volume, moving up to test key overhead resistance at about $23-$23.25. If it gets beyond that, the target is $26, and then $29 on a measured move. Celsion Corp. CLSN, -4.48% looking back long-term on a monthly chart, has built a massive six-year base. It has recently edged above the resistance line of that channel and looks poised to move higher. Short-term, it has had a 5-wave move, and then spent about two weeks consolidating before it popped out of the wedge on Tuesday. On Wednesday it followed through a little bit to $8.83, reaching my target of $8.75 near the top of the channel before backing off a bit, only closing up 8 cents on the session. Nonetheless, it traded 3.2 million shares, and if it does continue up the rising channel, it could reach 11 or 12 shortly. Uni-Pixel, Inc. US:UNXL had a monster move two days ago, exploding from $10 to $15, and even though it made a nominal new high Tuesday morning at $15.61, it backed off Wednesday to $12.88, only to snap back sharply into the close. This is a powerful pattern, and if it does get through the 15.25-15.75 range, it could spike to $18. On the short side, Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. AAWW, +2.03% had a head-and-shoulders top in recent months, and then broke down in late October and took out of the trend line and tested key support going back a year. Since then, it has done nothing more than form a bear wedge. If that bear wedge cracks, look for a quick test of $38-$39 followed by a plunge into the mid-$30s. Hibbett Sports, Inc. HIBB, +2.35% similar to AAWW, had a head-and-shoulders rounded top that appears to have broken. Recently the stock formed a flag or wedge, which broke down on Wednesday, closing near the lows for the day, down $1.60 to $51.10. I would not be shocked to see $47-$47.50 short-term followed by $43 longer-term. Mellanox Technologies, Ltd. MLNX, +3.77% in a downtrend off its September high, has attempted to rally back several times, but been contained by the down trend line. It has recently rallied in another bear flag, but isn't impressive, with the technicals flat at the bottom of the window. If it rolls over, could get all the way down to the mid-$50s.

AAWW,"Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings' AAWW third-quarter earnings rose 20% as the cargo airline company reported higher revenue in its core aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance-leasing business. However, the company lowered its full-year guidance, citing weakness in the airfreight market and a softer-than-expected peak season. It now sees per-share earnings of more than $4.65 from its earlier guidance of more than $5.10 a share. Shares fell 9.1% in light pre-market trading to $50. Through Wednesday's close, the stock was up 43% so far this year. Atlas Air has reported stronger earnings in recent quarters, even as the airfreight industry's overall growth rate has been slowing. The company has aimed to diversify its business, and has benefited recently from increased demand in South America and growth in its military passenger service. Chief Executive William J. Flynn said Thursday that despite market weakness and a decline in military-cargo demand, the latest quarter results were boosted by the company's efforts to modernize its fleet and grow its express network business. Atlas Air reported a profit of $33.9 million, or $1.27 a share, up from $28.2 million, or $1.07 a share, a year earlier. Excluding gains on the disposal of aircraft, pre-operating expenses, per-share earnings rose to $1.26 from $1.15. Revenue increased 13% to $409.3 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters were projecting per-share earnings of $1.35 on revenue of $415 million. Operating margin widened to 15.2% from 12%. Operating expenses rose 8.6% as aircraft fuel costs fell 4.4%. The aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance leasing business, the company's largest top-line contributor, reported a 8.8% revenue increase. AMC charter revenue was down 4.3% while commercial-charter revenue increased 54%. Subscribe to WSJ: http://online.wsj.com?mod=djnwires --Atlas Air says airfreight demand up, but less than expected --Volume growth from new product launches disappointing --CEO says airfreight demand still poised to grow (Adds details, comments from conference call throughout.) Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. AAWW, +2.03% cut its full-year financial guidance on weakness in the airfreight market, sending shares down more than 16%, even as it reported a 20% rise in earnings for the third quarter. Chief Executive Bill Flynn said the peak fall shipping season, when retailers stock up on inventories in advance of the holidays, has been weaker than he and other industry observers expected, partly because new product launches in the consumer-electronics space haven't provided a big lift in airfreight demand. ""Some [products] were delayed, and some simply haven't generated the [airfreight] volume that was anticipated in the market,"" Mr. Flynn said on a post-earnings conference call. ""Demand is up, but it's a bit less, frankly, than we expected,"" he said. ""We and the market generally expected more demand than we're seeing."" Mr. Flynn also said additional airfreight capacity had been put in place to handle the anticipated volume increases, further damping the market. Still, he maintained that the outlook for airfreight long term is bright, saying the transport mode remains ""a vital element of the global economy"" and will continue to grow. The Purchase, N.Y.-based cargo airline lowered its full-year earnings guidance, saying it now expects earnings ""to exceed"" $4.65 a share, compared with its earlier guidance of more than $5.10 a share. The stock was off about 16.5% in recent trading at $45.88 a share. Through Wednesday's close, the stock was up 43% this year.

AAWW,"Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.'s AAWW, +2.03% fourth-quarter earnings slid 19% amid charges and higher expenses, though the cargo airline company saw revenue growth despite continuing weak demand at its commercial charter business. The results badly missed expectations and the company projected per-share earnings for the year of more than $5.10. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters recently expected $5.62. Atlas Air has seen surging energy prices weigh on its profits in recent quarters while a reduction in commercial charter volume has slowed its revenue growth. On the whole, the air-freight market hasn't appeared poised for growth. Global air-freight traffic, considered an early barometer of business confidence, was weak through much of 2011 amid uncertainty about the economy. Atlas Air reported a profit of $33.5 million, or $1.27 a share, down from $41.6 million, or $1.58 a share, a year earlier. Excluding charges related to the retirement of its 747-200 fleet, delayed aircraft deliveries impacts and other items, earnings were $1.50. The company in November expected about $1.93, below analysts' views at the time. Revenue increased 7.9% to $388.2 million. Analysts recently projected $411 million. Operating margin fell to 13.8% from 17.1%. Operating expenses rose 12% as aircraft fuel costs surged 42%. The aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance leasing business--the company's largest top-line contributor--reported a 1.6% revenue increase. AMC charter revenue was up 48% while commercial charter revenue dropped 15%. Shares closed Tuesday at $50.46 and were inactive premarket. Through the close, the stock is up 31% this year.

AAWW,"Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. AAWW, +2.03% Chief Executive William J. Flynn said Thursday he expects a ""sluggish"" peak fall shipping season, although he noted that low inventories at retailers will help ensure that there is one. ""Any kind of [positive] movement on consumer demand should drive a peak"" because of the need to restock, Flynn said, speaking at a Dahlman Rose & Co. conference. Atlas Air, based in Purchase, N.Y., is an air-cargo carrier. Flynn also said he expects a number of new-product introductions this fall to help buoy this year's peak shipping season, which is the traditional time when retailers stock up in advance of the holidays. Still, ""it's probably going to be shorter in terms of duration"" than in some previous years, he said. Rob Knight, the chief financial officer of freight railroad Union Pacific Corp. UNP, +2.81% speaking at the same conference Wednesday, said he expects a ""compressed"" peak season this year. He didn't characterize it further, saying it was too early to tell.

AAWW,"--Boeing delivery schedule called tentative --Sees some 747-8F deliveries delayed into 2013 --Military passenger transport expected to grow strongly in 2012 (Recasts and updates with details on Boeing aircraft delivery schedule, additional details and stock activity.) Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. AAWW, +2.03% said Tuesday that it expects to receive the first of its long-awaited Boeing Co. BA, +2.46% 747-8F cargo jets in October, although the schedule remains tentative. The U.S. air cargo carrier is the first 747-8F customer to update guidance on delivery since Boeing changed the schedule for the aircraft's expected arrival to launch customer Cargolux Airlines International SA to ""later this summer"" from ""mid-2011"". The planes ""are coming, they're very close, and we're excited to get them,"" Atlas Air Chief Financial Officer Spencer Schwartz said on a post-earnings conference call, even as he cautioned that discussions with Boeing were ongoing. Design problems and other issues have caused Boeing to repeatedly push back its anticipated customer deliveries of the next-generation freighter jets. Atlas Air, based in Purchase, N.Y., has 12 on order, and it initially expected to get six by early last year and six this year. Atlas said that the latest revised Boeing schedule that it is currently reviewing calls for one delivery in October and two in November. Chief Executive William J. Flynn also said Atlas ""maybe"" will get four to seven of the planes in 2012, with the rest likely not coming until 2013. In February, Atlas said it anticipated having three of the 747-8Fs for the entire fourth quarter this year. ""We're in constant discussions with Boeing"" on the schedule for the aircraft, Flynn said. Boeing hasn't publicly provided a specific delivery schedule for Cargolux as it also nears first delivery of its new 787. Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd (0293.HK, CPCAY) also has said it expects to receive some 747-8Fs this year. Shares of Atlas Air were up 5.8% in recent trading, at $53.46, after the company reported second-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations, even though quarterly profit declined 27% from the year-earlier period. Atlas also reduced its full-year earnings outlook to $5 a share, from a previous outlook ""in excess"" of $5.30, primarily because of the latest Boeing 747-8F delivery schedule. The company previously has projected that each of the new aircraft would add about four cents a share per month to its diluted earnings per share. Meanwhile, Atlas executives said Tuesday that they expect their cargo flying for the U.S. military to fall to about 16,000 hours in 2012, from an estimated 18,000 hours this year. Still, they said expect Atlas's new military passenger service to register about 10,000 hours in 2012, from only about 1,000 this year in its first year of partial service. Troop transport ""will be an important contributor to us"" going forward, Flynn said. Atlas Air posted a second-quarter profit of $23.8 million, or 90 cents a share, down from $32.7 million, or $1.25 a share, a year earlier. Adjusted earnings were 90 cents, down from $1.82 a year earlier. Revenue slipped 1.9% to $349.6 million, due in part to a reduction in commercial charter volumes. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share earnings of 82 cents on $338 million in revenue.

AAWW,"Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc.'s AAWW, +2.03% first-quarter profit fell 69% on higher maintenance and aircraft fuel expenses, while revenue growth missed analysts' expectations. The broader transportation sector has reported stronger freight traffic for more than a year as the global economy recovers from a steep downturn, although a number of companies reported higher energy prices that dented first-quarter results. Atlas Air's aircraft fuel cost rose 15% in the latest quarter. On Tuesday, Atlas Air reported a profit of $10.5 million, or 40 cents a share, down from $33.8 million, or $1.30 a share, a year earlier. Excluding litigation settlement benefit and a aircraft sale gain, earnings a year ago would have been $1.06. Revenue improved 0.8% to $297.6 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 80 cents on revenue of $314 million. Operating margin narrowed to 5.5% from 16.3% on higher aircraft fuel and maintenance, materials and repairs expenses. The company's aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance leasing business, its largest top-line contributor, reported a 30% increase in revenue. Commercial charter revenue, however, declined 33%. Block hours grew 12% as revenue per block hour increased 6.5% at the AMC charter unit but fell 11% at the commercial charter unit. Average utilization jumped 6%.

AAWW,"Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings Inc. AAWW, +2.03% said the Department of Defense cleared its namesake airline to begin providing passenger charter service for U.S. military personnel, complementing its military cargo charter business. The move represents diversification from the company's traditional air-freight business, which is enjoying improving financial performance. Cargo haulers of all types have benefited from increased freight traffic in the wake of the economic downturn. In February, Atlas Air reported its fourth-quarter earnings topped analysts' expectations and gave an upbeat outlook for the current year. Under the new service, slated to start in May, Atlas Air will begin flying a Boeing Co. (BA) 747-400 passenger airplane acquired under an operating lease. It sees the move having a ""moderate impact"" on its profit in 2011 and expects ""meaningful earnings growth"" from passenger operations starting next year, President and Chief Executive William J.

AAWW,"LOS ANGELES (MarketWatch) -- Historically, on average there have been two particularly auspicious times to buy stock each year. Right now is one of those times. We are very bullish on shares, and for the following reasons: The broader market, best measured by the cumulative NYSE advance-decline line and the number of 52-week highs, is leading the averages higher. A market seldom gets into serious trouble when the average stock is outperforming the blue-chip issues that make up the Dow Jones Industrial Average INDU, -0.10% and the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38% In fact, a peak in the advance-decline line and number of 52-week highs, proxies for the average stock, normally precedes a bull market top in the Dow industrials by at least four to six months, making it one of the better long-term leading indicators. That this has not yet transpired increases the probability that a bull market top is some months down the road. This Week in Mutual Funds: Market Anniversaries Sector leadership is constructive. Important broad sectors which are highly sensitive to the economic cycle, such as the retailers and consumer discretionary stocks, are showing strong outperformance. In light of this, we do not believe that the economy will experience a double-dip in the remainder of 2010. A typical bull market does not end after just one year, but averages between two and three years, depending upon the measurement technique used. It would be unlikely for the bull market to end now after just a one-year advance, especially after the severe and lengthy onslaught inflicted by the 2007-2009 bear, whose wrath has left many groups undervalued by historic measures. Many stocks are forming sideways price consolidation areas, known as bases. Subsequent to an intermediate-term correction or bear market, this has been our most reliable indicator of an impending intermediate-term advance for the past 20 years. In fact, during this period, we have only encountered one other instance in which the market fell apart and moved to new lows despite the presence of many stocks building bases. Especially bullish is the fact that more stocks are forming bases at present than at any time since 1999, or before.

In summation, we are very bullish. We do not use adjectives lightly, and cannot recall the last time the term ""very bullish"" was used. Breadth, leadership, and Nasdaq volume are all positive. In particular, we like the fact that hundreds of stocks are building, and breaking out of, sideways areas of consolidation, known as bases, more than at any time since 1999, and possibly longer. Short-term, the averages have been overbought for eight-straight days, and thus deserving of a pullback.

Comparable sales in the U.K. grew 8.2%, or by 6.7% excluding fuel. The group said its U.K. operation saw significant external cost increases in the first half, mainly from higher oil-related costs and above-inflation increases in business rates. Although Tesco said it has budgeted for a large increase in oil-related costs, current oil prices suggest that actual costs may be as much as 60 million pounds above budget for the full year. This level will be hard to absorb fully through other cost savings, it added. ""We remain confident that we will make further progress in the second half,"" said Chief Executive Terry Leahy.

AAWW,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements included in Item 8 of this report. Business Overview We are a leading global provider of outsourced aircraft and aviation operating services. We operate the world's largest fleet of 747 freighters and provide customers a broad array of 747, 777, 767, 757 and 737 aircraft for domestic, regional and international cargo and passenger operations. We provide unique value to our customers by giving them access to highly reliable new production freighters that deliver the lowest unit cost in the marketplace combined with outsourced aircraft operating services that we believe lead the industry in terms of quality and global scale. Our customers include express delivery providers, e-commerce retailers, airlines, freight forwarders, the U.S. military and charter brokers. We provide global services with operations in Africa, Asia, Australia, Europe, the Middle East, North America and South America. We believe that the following competitive strengths will allow us to capitalize on opportunities that exist in the global airfreight industry: Market leader with leading-edge technology and differentiated, value-creating solutions The 747-8F and 777-200LRF aircraft are two of the most efficient long-haul wide-body commercial freighters available and we are currently the only operator offering these aircraft under ACMI and CMI agreements. Our operating model deploys our aircraft to drive maximum utilization and value from our fleet. The scale of our fleet enables us to have aircraft available globally to respond to our customers' needs, both on a planned and ad hoc basis. We believe this provides us with a commercial advantage over our competitors that operate smaller and less flexible fleets. Our Dry Leasing business is primarily focused on a portfolio of six 777-200LRF aircraft and our growing fleet of 767-300 freighter aircraft for regional and domestic applications. These aircraft are dry leased to customers on a long-term basis, which further diversifies our business mix and enhances our predictable, long-term revenue and earnings streams. Stable base of contractual revenue and reduced operational risk Our focus on providing long-term contracted aircraft and operating solutions to customers stabilizes our revenues and reduces our operational risk. ACMI and CMI contracts with customers generally range from two to seven years, although some contracts have shorter or longer durations. Dry Leasing contracts with customers generally range from five to twelve years. Under ACMI, CMI and Dry Leasing, our customers assume fuel, demand and price risk resulting in reduced operational risk for AAWW. ACMI, CMI and Dry Leasing contracts typically provide us with a guaranteed minimum level of revenue and target level of profitability. Focus on asset optimization By managing the largest fleet of outsourced freighter aircraft, we achieve significant economies of scale in areas such as aircraft maintenance, crew efficiency, crew training, inventory management and purchasing. Our mix of aircraft is closely aligned with our customer needs. By providing the broadest array of 747, 777, 767, 757 and 737 aircraft for domestic, regional and international applications, we believe that we are well-suited to meet the current and anticipated requirements of our customers. We continually evaluate our fleet to ensure that we offer the most efficient and effective mix of aircraft to meet our customers' needs. Our service model is unique in that we offer a portfolio of operating solutions that complement our freighter aircraft businesses. We believe this allows us to improve the returns we generate from our asset base by allowing us to flexibly redeploy aircraft to meet changing market conditions, ensuring the maximum utilization of our fleet. Our Charter services complement our ACMI services by allowing us to increase aircraft utilization during open time and to react to changes in demand and Yield in these segments. We have employees situated around the globe who closely monitor demand for commercial charter services in each region, enabling us to redeploy available aircraft quickly. We also endeavor to manage our portfolio to stagger contract terms, which mitigates our remarketing risks and aircraft down time. Long-term strategic customer relationships and unique innovative service offerings We combine the global scope and scale of our efficient aircraft fleet with high-quality, cost-effective operations and premium customer service to provide unique, fully integrated and reliable solutions for our customers. We believe this approach results in customers that are motivated to seek long-term relationships with us. This has historically allowed us to command higher prices than our competitors in several key areas. These long-term relationships help us to build resilience into our business model. Our customers have access to our innovative solutions, such as inter-operable crews, flight scheduling, fuel-efficiency planning, and maintenance spare coverage, which, we believe, set us apart from other participants in the outsourced aircraft and aviation operating services market. Furthermore, we have access to valuable operating rights to restricted markets such as Brazil, Japan and China. We believe our freighter services allow our customers to effectively expand their capacity and operate dedicated freighter aircraft without simultaneously taking on exposure to fluctuations in the value of owned aircraft and, in the case of our ACMI and CMI contracts, long-term expenses relating to crews and maintenance. Dedicated freighter aircraft enable schedules to be driven by cargo rather than passenger demand (for those customers that typically handle portions of their cargo operations via belly capacity on passenger aircraft), which we believe allows our customers to drive higher contribution from cargo operations. We are focused on providing safe, secure and reliable services. Atlas, Polar and Southern Air all have successfully completed the International Air Transport Association's Operational Safety Audit (IOSA), a globally recognized safety and quality standard. We provide outsourced aircraft and aviation services to some of the world's premier express delivery providers, e-commerce retailers, airlines and freight forwarders. We will take advantage of opportunities to maintain and expand our relationships with our existing customers, while seeking new customers and new geographic markets. In 2016, we entered into agreements with Amazon, which involve, among other things, the lease and operation of 20 aircraft. Between August 2016 and December 2017, we have placed 12 of these into service and we expect to be operating all 20 before the end of 2018. Also in 2016, we expanded our relationship with DHL through the acquisition of Southern Air which provided us with immediate entry into the 777 and 737 aircraft operating platforms, with ten aircraft and the potential for developing additional business with existing and new customers. Experienced management team Our management team has extensive operating and leadership experience in the airfreight, airline, aircraft leasing and logistics industries at companies such as United Airlines, US Airways, Lufthansa Cargo, GE Capital Aviation Services, Air Canada, Canadian Airlines, Cathay Pacific, Continental Airlines, ICF International, ASTAR Air Cargo and KLM Cargo, as well as the United States Army, Navy, Air Force and Federal Air Marshal Service. Our management team is led by William J. Flynn, who has over 40 years of experience in freight and transportation and has held senior management positions with several transportation companies. Prior to joining AAWW more than ten years ago, Mr. Flynn was President and CEO of GeoLogistics, a global transportation and logistics enterprise. Business Strategy Our strategy includes the following: Focus on securing long-term customer contracts We will continue to focus on securing long-term contracts with customers, including customers in the fast-growing express, Asian and e-commerce markets, which provide us with stable revenue streams and predictable margins. In addition, these agreements limit our direct exposure to fuel and other costs and mitigate the risk of fluctuations in both Yield and demand in the airfreight business, while also improving the overall utilization of our fleet. Aggressively manage our fleet with a focus on leading-edge aircraft We continue to actively manage our fleet of leading-edge wide-body freighter aircraft to meet customer demands. Our 747-8F and 777-200LRF freighter aircraft are primarily utilized in our ACMI business, while our 747-400s are utilized in our ACMI and Charter business. We aggressively manage our fleet to ensure that we provide our customers with the most efficient aircraft to meet their needs. Our Dry Leasing business is primarily focused on a portfolio of six modern, efficient 777-200LRF aircraft and our growing fleet of 767-300 freighter aircraft for regional and domestic applications. We will continue to explore opportunities to invest in additional aircraft, such as the 767-300 freighter aircraft committed to Amazon. Drive significant and ongoing productivity improvements We continue to enhance our organization through a cost saving and productivity enhancing initiative called ""Continuous Improvement."" We created a separate department to drive the process and to involve all areas of the organization in the effort to reexamine, redesign and improve the way we do business. Selectively pursue and evaluate future acquisitions and alliances From time to time, we explore business combinations, such as our acquisition of Southern Air, and alliances with e-commerce providers, such as our agreements with Amazon, other cargo airlines, services providers, dry leasing and other companies to enhance our competitive position, geographic reach and service portfolio. Appropriately managing capital allocation and delivering value to shareholders Our commitment to creating, enhancing and delivering value to our shareholders reflects a disciplined and balanced capital allocation strategy. Our focus is on maintaining a strong balance sheet, investing in modern efficient assets, and returning capital to shareholders. Business Developments Our ACMI results for 2017, compared with 2016, were positively impacted by increased flying reflecting the Southern Air acquisition, higher utilization and the following events: In February 2016, we began CMI flying for DHL a 767-300 freighter aircraft, Dry Leased from Titan, in DHL's North American network, increasing the number of 767 freighter aircraft in CMI service for DHL to 13. In April 2016, we acquired Southern Air, which currently operates five 777-200LRF and five 737-400F aircraft under CMI agreements for DHL. Between August 2016 and December 2017, we began CMI flying for Amazon the first 12 of 20 Boeing 767-300 freighter aircraft Dry Leased from Titan and we expect to be operating all 20 by the end of 2018. During the first quarter of 2017, we began flying a 747-400 freighter for Nippon Cargo Airlines on transpacific routes. In September 2017, we began flying a second 747-400 freighter for them on transpacific routes. During the first quarter of 2017, we began flying a 747-400 freighter for Asiana Cargo on transpacific routes. During the second quarter of 2017, we began ACMI flying two 747-8F aircraft for Cathay Pacific Cargo to supplement capacity on its existing route network. During the second quarter of 2017, we began ACMI flying a 747-400 freighter for Suparna Airlines, formerly known as Yangtze River Airlines, on transpacific routes. During the third quarter of 2017, we entered into an ACMI agreement with Hong Kong Air Cargo to operate up to three 747-400 freighter aircraft. We began flying an aircraft in September 2017 on transpacific routes. In September 2017, we began ACMI flying a 747-400 freighter for DHL Global Forwarding on routes between the United States, Europe, and Asia. During 2017, both ACMI and Charter results were negatively impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Harvey and work slowdowns and service interruptions for which the Company was granted a preliminary injunction in November 2017 (See Note 14 to our Financial Statements). Charter results for 2017 also reflected higher Yields and increased demand for commercial cargo and increased cargo and passenger demand from the AMC, partially offset by lower rates from the AMC. During 2017, we entered into six operating leases for 747-400 freighter aircraft to meet increased customer demand in our ACMI and Charter businesses. Two aircraft entered service in 2017 and the other four will enter service throughout 2018. In February 2016, we began Dry Leasing one 767-300 converted freighter aircraft to DHL on a long-term basis. As described above, between August 2016 and December 2017, we began Dry Leasing 12 767-300 converted freighter aircraft to Amazon on a long-term basis. Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our Financial Statements and other financial information appearing and referred to elsewhere in this report.

The increase in Block Hours reflects the impact from the Southern Air acquisition, the start-up of 767 flying for Amazon and 747 flying for several new customers, as well as higher aircraft utilization. Revenue per Block Hour decreased primarily due to the impact of 777-200 and 737-400 CMI flying from the Southern Air acquisition and increased 767 and 747-400 CMI flying.

Revenue per Block Hour increased primarily due to higher Yields for commercial cargo, higher fuel prices and the impact of Charter capacity purchased from our ACMI customers that had no associated Charter Block Hours, partially offset by lower rates from the AMC. The increase in Charter Block Hours was primarily driven by increased commercial cargo demand and increased cargo and passenger demand from the AMC. Dry Leasing Dry Leasing revenue increased $14.0 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to the placement of 767-300 converted freighter aircraft, partially offset by lower maintenance payments received related to the scheduled return of an aircraft during 2016.

In addition, crewmember costs were negatively impacted by the aforementioned labor-related operational disruptions. Partially offsetting these items were costs resulting from a 2016 change in control, as defined under certain benefit plans, related to the Amazon transaction (see Note 7 to our Financial Statements) and lower costs related to crew training. Aircraft fuel increased $57.9 million, or 21.1%, primarily due to higher fuel consumption reflecting the increase in Charter Block Hours operated and a higher average fuel cost per gallon. We do not incur fuel expense in our ACMI or Dry Leasing businesses as the cost of fuel is borne by the customer. Average fuel cost per gallon and fuel consumption for 2017 and 2016 were:  2017 2016 Inc/(Dec) % Change Average fuel cost per gallon $ 1.89 $ 1.68 $ 0.21 12.5 % Fuel gallons consumed (000s) 176,093 163,862 12,231 7.5 %  Maintenance, materials and repairs increased by $67.6 million, or 32.8%, primarily reflecting $41.9 million of higher Line Maintenance expense due to increased flying and additional repairs performed, the Southern Air acquisition, and $25.1 million of higher Heavy Maintenance expense. The higher Line Maintenance primarily reflected increases of $16.7 million for 767 aircraft, $14.7 million for 747-400 aircraft, $7.0 million for 747-8F aircraft and $2.9 million for 777 aircraft. Heavy Maintenance expense on 747-400 aircraft increased $22.4 million primarily due to an increase in the number of D Checks, engine overhauls and additional repairs performed. Heavy Maintenance expense on 767 aircraft increased $4.5 million primarily due to an increase in the number of C Checks. Heavy Maintenance expense on 747-8F aircraft decreased $3.0 million primarily due to a decrease in unscheduled engine repairs, partially offset by an increase in the number of C Checks. Heavy airframe maintenance checks and engine overhauls impacting Maintenance, materials and repairs for 2017 and 2016 were:  Heavy Maintenance Events 2017 2016 Inc/(Dec) 747-8F C Checks 6 4 2 747-400 C Checks 9 9 - 767 C Checks 4 1 3 747-400 D Checks 7 4 3 CF6-80 engine overhauls 5 3 2  Depreciation and amortization increased $17.8 million, or 12.0%, primarily due to additional aircraft operating in 2017 and an increase in the amortization of deferred maintenance costs related to 747-8F engine overhauls (see Note 2 to our Financial Statements). Travel increased $17.0 million, or 13.3%, primarily due to the impact of the Southern Air acquisition and increased flying, partially offset by lower rates for crewmember travel. Aircraft rent decreased $3.2 million, or 2.2%, primarily due to the amendment and extension of a lease for a 747-400 freighter aircraft to a lower monthly lease rate (see Note 9 to our Financial Statements) and a reduction in the number of spare engines leased. Navigation fees, landing fees and other rent increased $37.9 million, or 48.3%, primarily due to an increase in purchased capacity and increased flying. Passenger and ground handling services increased $18.1 million, or 20.2%, primarily due to increased Charter flying. Special charge in 2016 primarily represented a $10.1 million loss on engines held for sale (see Note 5 to our Financial Statements). We may sell additional flight equipment, which could result in additional charges in future periods. Transaction-related expenses in 2017 related to the Southern Air acquisition, which primarily included professional fees and integration costs. Transaction-related expenses in 2016 related to the Southern Air acquisition and our transaction with Amazon and primarily included: compensation costs, including employee termination benefits; professional fees; and integration costs (see Notes 4 and 7 to our Financial Statements). Other increased $25.9 million, or 18.2%, primarily due to increased commission expense on higher revenue from the AMC, the impact of the Southern Air acquisition and other growth initiatives, and higher legal and professional fees related to our preliminary injunction to stop the aforementioned labor-related operational disruptions. Partially offsetting these items was an accrual for legal matters in 2016.

Our focus on express, e-commerce and fast-growing Asian markets has broadened our customer base and fleet. As a result, we were well-positioned to capitalize on market dynamics and deliver fourth-quarter and full-year volumes, revenues, EBITDA and net income that grew sharply compared to the prior-year. ""In addition, our fourth-quarter and full-year results benefited from the passage of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in late December, which generated a significant gain related to the revaluation of our net deferred tax liabilities. ""We expect the new tax legislation to have a positive impact on economic activity and corporate growth. On passage of the law, we were pleased to provide a one-time bonus of $1,000 to our global personnel in recognition of their hard work and commitment to the company's growth."" Turning to 2018 and beyond, Mr. Flynn stated: ""We are operating in a strong airfreight environment, underpinned by global economic growth. ""We see tremendous opportunity for continued growth in the express and e-commerce markets, fueled by a bourgeoning middle class with higher levels of disposable income. Further globalization will require expansive and time-definite air networks to facilitate the international flow of goods. ""From a regional perspective, we believe Asia is key. It is an important geography to global trade, the source of 40% of global airfreight demand, and the main contributor to the expanding global middle class. ""In addition to the demand we are seeing for our aircraft and services, we are capitalizing on the quality, scale and scope of our operations to drive our revenues and earnings to greater levels. As a result, we expect our adjusted net income to grow by a mid-twenty-percent level in 2018 compared with 2017, including the benefit of a lower corporate income tax rate. ""By comparison, even without any benefit from tax reform, we would have expected our 2018 adjusted net income to grow by a teens percentage."" Fourth-Quarter Results Volumes in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 18% to 71,563 block hours, with revenue growing 19% to a record $628.0 million. Reported income from continuing operations, net of taxes, during the period totaled $209.5 million, or $6.71 per diluted share, compared with $28.7 million, or $1.12 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Reported results for the latest quarter included a $130.0 million benefit related to the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities as well as an unrealized gain on outstanding warrants of $23.7 million. Results in the year-ago period included an unrealized loss of $27.9 million on outstanding warrants. On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 13% to a record $66.6 million, or $2.43 per diluted share, from adjusted income of $59.0 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. EBITDA, as adjusted, increased 14% to $162.7 million. Record ACMI segment revenues and contribution in the fourth quarter of 2017 were primarily driven by significant growth in block-hour volumes, partially offset by higher line maintenance and labor-related operational disruptions. Block-hour growth during the period reflected 747-400 flying for several new customers, 747-8 flying for Cathay Pacific Cargo, additional seasonal flying for express operators, and the ramp-up of 767-300 operations for Amazon. Five new 767-300s were placed in service for Amazon during the quarter, raising the current number to 12, in line with our expectations when we began ramping up this new service in 2016 and in line with our expectations for a total of 20 aircraft by the end of 2018. Higher Charter segment contribution during the period was primarily driven by an increase in commercial yields, partially offset by higher maintenance costs, the redeployment of 747-8 and 747-400 aircraft to the ACMI segment, and labor-related operational disruptions. Higher average rates during the quarter primarily reflected the impact of strong commercial yields. In Dry Leasing, higher segment contribution primarily reflected a reduction in interest expense due to the scheduled repayment of debt related to dry leased 777 aircraft and the placement of additional 767-300 converted aircraft. Reported earnings in the fourth quarter of 2017 also included an effective income tax benefit rate of 95.7%, due mainly to the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On an adjusted basis, our results reflected an effective income tax rate of 31.4%. Full-Year Results Volumes in 2017 increased 20% to 252,802 block hours, with revenue growing 17% to a record $2.16 billion. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2017, our continuing operations generated income of $224.3 million, or $8.68 per diluted share, which included the $130.0 million benefit related to the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities, partially offset by an unrealized loss on financial instruments of $12.5 million related to outstanding warrants. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our income from continuing operations totaled $42.6 million, or $1.70 per diluted share, including the negative impacts of transaction-related expenses and warrant accounting totaling $25.0 million. On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations in 2017 increased 17% to $133.7 million, or $4.93 per diluted share, compared with $114.3 million, or $4.50 per diluted share, in 2016. EBITDA, as adjusted, rose 12% to $428.6 million. Reported earnings in 2017 also included an effective income tax benefit rate of 56.5%, due mainly to the revaluation of our deferred tax liabilities as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. On an adjusted basis, our results reflected an effective income tax rate of 28.4%. Cash and Short-Term Investments At December 31, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $305.5 million, compared with $142.6 million at December 31, 2016. The change in position resulted from cash provided by operating and financing activities, partially offset by cash used for investing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities during 2017 primarily reflected proceeds from our issuance of convertible notes and our financings of 767-300 aircraft, partially offset by payments on debt obligations. During the fourth quarter of 2017, we completed the financings of six additional 767-300 aircraft, which generated cash of $145.8 million. Net cash used for investing activities during 2017 primarily related to capital expenditures and payments for flight equipment and modifications, including the acquisition of 767-300 aircraft to be converted to freighter configuration, spare engines and GEnx engine performance upgrade kits. 2018 Outlook We expect to report strong earnings growth in 2018. We begin 2018 with solid demand from our customers for our aircraft and services. With the essential building blocks we have set in place, we see opportunities to grow with existing customers and to add new ones. Globally, economic activity is expanding. The airfreight market is strong, and airfreight tonnage continues to grow from record levels. As a result, we expect significant growth in our volumes, revenue and adjusted EBITDA in 2018. We see volumes rising to around 300,000 block hours, revenue growing to approximately $2.5 billion, and adjusted EBITDA of about $500 million. We anticipate that our full-year 2018 adjusted net income will grow by a mid-twenty-percent level compared with 2017, including the benefit of tax reform. Without tax reform, we would have expected our adjusted net income to grow by a teens percentage this year. We expect our full-year 2018 adjusted income tax rate to be approximately 17%. Given the inherent seasonality of airfreight demand, we anticipate that results in 2018 will reflect historical patterns, with more than 70% of our adjusted net income occurring in the second half. In addition, we expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $90 million in the first quarter of 2018, and adjusted net income to be approximately double adjusted net income of $8.3 million in the first quarter of 2017. For the full year, we anticipate total block hours will increase approximately 19% compared with 2017, with about 75% of our hours in ACMI and the balance in Charter. To meet the anticipated increase in ACMI and Charter demand, we have entered into operating leases for six 747-400 freighter aircraft. Two of these aircraft entered service in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2017; four will enter service throughout 2018. Aircraft maintenance expense in 2018 is expected to total approximately $315 million, mainly reflecting an increase in daily line maintenance due to the anticipated growth in block hours. Depreciation and amortization is expected to total approximately $220 million. In addition, core capital expenditures, which exclude aircraft and engine purchases, are expected to total approximately $100 to $110 million, mainly for parts and components for our fleet. We provide guidance on an adjusted basis because we are unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the effects of outstanding warrants and other items that could be material to our reported results. Conference Call Management will host a conference call to discuss Atlas Air Worldwide's fourth-quarter and full-year 2017 financial and operating results at 11:00 a.m. Eastern Time on Thursday, February 22, 2018.

A replay will also be available through February 28 by dialing (855) 859-2056 (U.S. Toll Free) or (404) 537-3406 (from outside the U.S.) and using Access Code 8276523#. About Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures to assist in the evaluation of our business performance. These non-GAAP measures include EBITDA, as adjusted; Direct Contribution; Adjusted income from continuing operations, net of taxes; Adjusted Diluted EPS from continuing operations, net of taxes; Adjusted effective tax rate; and Free Cash Flow, which exclude certain noncash income and expenses, and items impacting year-over-year comparisons of our results. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Income from continuing operations, net of taxes; Diluted EPS from continuing operations, net of taxes; Effective tax rate; and Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, which are the most directly comparable measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of the company's ongoing operations and in planning and forecasting future periods. In addition, management's incentive compensation is determined, in part, by using Adjusted Income from continuing operations, net of taxes. We believe that these adjusted measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance.

AAWW,"PURCHASE, N.Y., Nov 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Significant Revenue and Volume Growth Warrant Accounting Resulted in Reported Loss from Continuing Operations of $24.2 Million Excluding Warrant Accounting, Adjusted Income from Continuing Operations Was $29.7 Million After $1.7 Million Impact Related to Hurricanes 10 Aircraft Now Placed with Amazon Anticipating Strong Fourth Quarter; Slight Adjustment to Full-Year Outlook Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, Inc. AAWW, +2.03% today announced a loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, of $24.2 million, or $0.96 per diluted share, including an unrealized loss on warrants of $44.8 million, for the three months ended September 30, 2017. Results compared with a loss from continuing operations, net of taxes, of $7.5 million, or $0.30 per diluted share, for the three months ended September 30, 2016, which was primarily due to the tax impact of nondeductible expenses. On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations, net of taxes, in the third quarter of 2017 totaled $29.7 million, or $1.08 per diluted share, which included a negative impact of $1.7 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, related to hurricanes. Results for the period compared with adjusted income of $27.4 million, or $1.09 per diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. ""We are encouraged by our performance in the third quarter, with 20% increases in both revenue and block hours, and higher direct contribution in all of our segments,"" said President and Chief Executive Officer William J. Flynn. ""Reflecting the strong demand for our services, yields rose and the utilization of our aircraft increased. ""We also placed and began operating our seventh 767-300 aircraft for Amazon in August, and introduced aircraft eight, nine and 10 in October. We remain on track to ramp up to a full 20 aircraft for Amazon by the end of 2018. ""In addition, we commenced flying for two new customers during the quarter - DHL Global Forwarding and Hong Kong Air Cargo, and we started operating our second 747-400 freighter for Nippon Cargo Airlines. ""While demand, volumes, yields and utilization increased during the third quarter, some of that performance was offset by higher maintenance expenses, labor-related operational disruptions and Hurricanes Irma and Harvey."" Mr. Flynn added: ""We were pleased to provide support and assistance for communities affected by the recent hurricanes. In September, we provided relief to affected pilots, other employees, and their families in the Miami and Houston areas as well as charitable donations for local recovery efforts. In October, we donated to the relief efforts in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, and we partnered with JetBlue to deliver 117 tonnes of humanitarian aid to the island on our aircraft. We also operated multiple hurricane-relief charters on behalf of Atlas Air and our customers, with the speed that only airfreight can provide. ""We are looking forward to a strong fourth quarter, and anticipate solid peak-season yields and volumes. Reflecting our year-to-date results and our fourth-quarter expectations, we anticipate that our full-year 2017 adjusted income from continuing operations, net of taxes, will grow by a high-single-digit to low-double-digit percentage compared with our 2016 adjusted income of $114.3 million."" Mr. Flynn concluded: ""The future for Atlas and for airfreight is bright. Growth in Asia and an expansion of the global middle class are transforming the global economy. Increased disposable income will support a strong future for global trade and the consumption of goods. And our strategic focus on express and e-commerce service and the faster-growing Asian markets positions us for further business growth as we carry through the balance of 2017, into 2018 and beyond."" Third-Quarter Results ACMI segment contribution in the third quarter of 2017 was slightly higher compared with the prior-year period, as an increase in flying was largely offset by higher maintenance costs and labor-related operational disruptions. Segment revenue growth benefited from an increase in block-hour volumes as well as higher aircraft utilization. Higher Charter segment contribution during the period was primarily driven by an increase in commercial yields, partially offset by higher maintenance costs, the redeployment of a 747-8F aircraft to the ACMI segment, hurricane-related impacts and labor-related operational disruptions. Higher average rates during the quarter primarily reflected the impact of Charter capacity we purchased from our ACMI customers on flights that had no associated Charter block hours, higher fuel prices and higher commercial yields. In Dry Leasing, higher segment contribution primarily reflected a reduction in interest expense due to the scheduled repayment of debt related to dry leased 777 aircraft and the placement of 767-300 converted aircraft. Reported earnings in the third quarter also included an effective income tax expense rate of 72.7%, due mainly to nontaxable changes in the value of outstanding warrants. On an adjusted basis, our results reflected an effective income tax rate of 24.3%. Nine-Month Results For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, our continuing operations generated income of $14.9 million, or $0.58 per diluted share, which included the impact of an unrealized loss on financial instruments of $36.2 million related to outstanding warrants. For the nine months ended September 30, 2016, our income from continuing operations totaled $13.9 million, or a loss of $0.49 per diluted share, after the impact of warrant accounting and transaction-related expenses. On an adjusted basis, income from continuing operations in the first nine months of 2017 totaled $67.1 million, or $2.48 per diluted share, compared with $55.3 million, or $2.20 per diluted share, in the first nine months of 2016. Cash and Short-Term Investments At September 30, 2017, our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash totaled $187.0 million, compared with $142.6 million at December 31, 2016. The change in position resulted from cash provided by operating and financing activities, partially offset by cash used for investing activities. Net cash provided by financing activities during the first nine months of 2017 primarily reflected proceeds from our issuance of convertible notes and our financings of 767-300 aircraft, partially offset by payments on debt obligations. In October, we completed the financings of three additional 767-300 aircraft, which generated cash of $72.6 million. Net cash used for investing activities during the first nine months primarily related to capital expenditures and payments for flight equipment and modifications, including the acquisition of 767-300 aircraft to be converted to freighter configuration, spare engines and GEnx engine performance upgrade kits. Labor Update In September 2017, the company requested the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to issue a preliminary injunction to require the International Brotherhood of Teamsters to meet its obligations under the Railway Labor Act and stop its illegal, intentional work slowdowns and service interruptions, which are intended to gain leverage in pilot contract negotiations with the company. The hearing was completed in early November and a ruling on the request for a preliminary injunction is expected later this month. Outlook Looking to the fourth quarter and full year, we anticipate increased peak-season yields and volumes, including our additional seasonal flying for express and e-commerce operators. Consistent with our year-to-date performance and our fourth-quarter expectations, we anticipate that our full-year 2017 adjusted income from continuing operations, net of taxes, will grow by a high-single-digit to low-double-digit percentage compared with our 2016 adjusted income of $114.3 million. For the full year, we expect total block hours to increase approximately 20% compared with 2016, with about 75% of our hours in ACMI and the balance in Charter. Aircraft maintenance expense in 2017 should total approximately $275 million, and depreciation and amortization is expected to total approximately $165 million. In addition, core capital expenditures, which exclude aircraft and engine purchases, are expected to total approximately $75 to $80 million, mainly for parts and components for our fleet. We provide guidance on an adjusted basis because we are unable to predict, with reasonable certainty, the effects of outstanding warrants and other items that could be material to our reported results.

About Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement our financial statements presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we present certain non-GAAP financial measures to assist in the evaluation of our business performance. These non-GAAP measures include EBITDA, as adjusted; Direct Contribution; Adjusted income from continuing operations, net of taxes; Adjusted Diluted EPS from continuing operations, net of taxes; Adjusted effective tax rate; and Free Cash Flow, which exclude certain noncash income and expenses, and items impacting year-over-year comparisons of our results. These non-GAAP measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Income from continuing operations, net of taxes; Diluted EPS from continuing operations, net of taxes; Effective tax rate; and Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities, which are the most directly comparable measures of performance prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing the performance of the company's ongoing operations and in planning and forecasting future periods. In addition, management's incentive compensation will be determined, in part, by using Adjusted Income from continuing operations, net of taxes. We believe that these adjusted measures, when considered together with the corresponding U.S. GAAP financial measures and the reconciliations to those measures, provide meaningful supplemental information to assist investors and analysts in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance.

AAWW,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 30, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Tuesday is the first hearing in a lawsuit filed by Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings AAWW, +2.03% and its subsidiaries, Atlas Air and Polar Air Cargo, against its pilots, aimed at dodging blame for the company's failures to address the staffing and operational challenges threatening its ability to deliver for customers like DHL Express and Amazon. New court documents filed by the pilots and their union, including declarations from veteran pilots and industry experts, reveal management's systemic disregard for its employees and growing issues related to the carriers' rapidly-expanding flight operations, calling into question every element of the company's claims. AAWW is contracted to fly 20 planes for Amazon Prime Air by 2018. ""We agree with Atlas: our airlines face serious challenges that threaten our ability to get the job done for customers like Amazon and DHL. But company executives are trying to blame dedicated pilots for their own management failures and intransigence that created this crisis,"" said Capt. Daniel Wells, an Atlas Air pilot and president of Teamsters Local 1224, which represents pilots at the AAWW carriers. ""AAWW's management refuses to recognize an existential threat to our company's future. Years of substandard pay, working conditions and fatigue-inducing operations have fueled record attrition and staffing problems at our airlines. Today's generation of pilots will not come to work for a company that treats its employees the way AAWW does. Atlas' poor and out-of-touch management has pushed our operations to a breaking point where just one pilot calling in sick because he's violently ill can disrupt the entire operation."" AAWW's lawsuit alleges the pilots and their union representatives, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and Airline Professional Association Teamsters Local 1224, are responsible for the airlines' mounting scheduling failures and growing scrutiny the carriers have received from customers and the public. But new court documents filed by the pilots and their union, including testimonies from veteran pilots and industry experts, paint a strikingly different picture, showing a pattern of disregard by management for the intensifying challenges. In a declaration submitted last week, Captain Robert Kirchner, a longtime Atlas Air pilot and Executive Council Chairman at Local 1224 describes a 2014 meeting with a senior Atlas executive in which they discussed the ""increasingly chaotic changes"" that were degrading the airline's operations and placing great stress on the pilots. The executive assured Captain Kirchner that it would be ""no problem"" to work with the union on a mutually-beneficial relationship to address these operational issues in compliance with the pilots' contract. Yet the declaration details how the company undermined this understanding only months later by unilaterally subverting the contract to prevent longtime company experienced pilots from filling captain seats on company aircraft, denying them an earned promotion. Captain Kirchner's declaration also describes management's strategy of ""bouncing pilots from one schedule change to another"" and ""harassing pilots who are sick or fatigued"" in response to a business model that has become ""increasingly strained."" The documents also include testimonies from experts and senior pilots that highlight the serious effects of fatigue on flight operations and, in very personal detail, disprove the company's claims regarding any type of alleged pilot ""slow down"": In response to the company's statistical analysis alleging a purposeful work slowdown, industry economist Dan Akins noted: ""…there is no relationship proven by Dr. Lee between alleged pilot actions and the company's poor operational performance. Rather, it appears that the operational deterioration at Atlas is a function of growth in the operation and a systematic failure to adequately deploy appropriate resources to support the operation."" Concerning the company's accusations regarding fatigue, workplace fatigue expert Dr. Terry Von Thaden said of one pilot's experiences: ""After reviewing Captain Bellman's narrative report, I believe that he acted responsibly and the best interest of safety. Atlas and Polar have readily acknowledged that fatigue calls in Sydney Australia are especially challenging. And, due to the rapid shift in time zones and due to the circadian rhythm, fatigue calls in Sydney are not new: Atlas and Polar have been confronted with them for a considerably long time. Yet they have not done nearly enough to mitigate the situations that cause fatigue calls that happen there."" One pilot describes the grueling scheduling protocols that led to his decision to call in fatigued: ""Idid not get any useful rest, as my room was located next to the pool, where a large group of guests was playing, splashing and listening to loud music… Several hours before wakeup, I noticed that one of the [first officers] had been removed from the schedule - leaving a 2-person crew to operate a nearly 8-hour red-eye flight with 340 passengers on board. At this time, without any rest possible on the flight, in the interest of safety, I decided to call in fatigued."" The trial runs through November 2 and will start Tuesday at 11 AM ET at the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia at 333 Constitution Avenue N.W. in Washington, D.C. Several pilots and experts, as well as key witnesses from the company, are scheduled to testify. Captain Wells concluded: ""We're confident the evidence presented in court will defend us against AAWW's spurious claims. Our customers deserve comprehensive solutions that ensure our companies can live up to our commitments to them. We urge Atlas management to put an end to the legal tricks and get serious about working with pilots in good faith on the genuine issues we face. The future of the company is at stake."" BACKGROUND: On September 25, Atlas Air, Inc. and Polar Air Cargo, two subsidiaries of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, filed a lawsuit against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and its affiliate APA Teamsters Local 1224, which represents the airlines' pilots, alleging they are responsible for both the companies' scheduling failures and the growing scrutiny the carriers have received from their customers. In February 2017, the company sued the union to try and force them into a process that would ""amalgamate"" the collective bargaining agreements of Atlas Air and sister company (also represented by the Teamsters) Southern Air. The union had rejected the company's plea as it would result in a collective bargaining agreement far below industry standards. That lawsuit continues in The United States District Court for Southern New York. At the same time, years of substandard pay and working conditions, combined with the pilot shortage, have fueled significant staffing issues at AAWW's airlines that could undermine their ability to deliver for key customers like DHL and Amazon. Atlas Air saw significantly more pilots leave the company in the first eight months of 2017 as it did in the entirety of the previous year. From January to August 2017, Atlas also experienced a 32 percent increase in pilot resignations compared to the entirety of 2016.

AAWW,"WASHINGTON, Oct. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- In response to a lawsuit that Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings AAWW, +2.03% and its subsidiaries, Atlas Air and Polar Air Cargo, filed against its pilots' union, pilots are reiterating their concerns about the intensifying staffing crisis that is driving operational challenges at AAWW's airlines. An initial status conference on the lawsuit was held on September 29 [th] before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The judge has scheduled the case for trial on October 31st in Washington D.C. After reviewing the filing in detail, pilots and officials from APA Teamsters Local 1224, which represents pilots at Atlas and Polar, are issuing the following statements: ""The operation at Atlas is falling apart because of chronic mismanagement, a shortage of pilots, and a lack of other key operational personnel,"" says Capt. Robert Kirchner, a long-time Atlas pilot and Executive Council Chairman of Teamsters Local 1224. ""We have seen this coming for years and have tried to work with Atlas' management to address the problem. Unfortunately, this is just the tip of the iceberg as the company not only grapples with finding enough pilots for its current operations, but must also deal with how to staff any expansion of its business.  This lawsuit is nothing more than a blatant attempt by Atlas to pass blame and distract customers' attention from operational failings. This lawsuit is a shocking misuse of shareholder dollars that gets us no closer to being able to deliver for our customers."" ""AAWW and its affiliates are using phony excuses to disguise their chaotic mismanagement and inability to appropriately staff its operations after having expanded those operations too far and too fast,"" said Capt. Daniel Wells, President of Teamsters Local 1224. ""This has put great stress on our members, and the company is once again undermining the career security of its pilots through yet another lawsuit aimed at forcing them into a substandard contract.""  Mr. Wells continued, saying: ""Our members are professionals. Pilots do not need the union to tell them how to perform or when their company is abusing them. Pilots recognize abusive corporate behavior when they see it and they fell it and they simply will not fall victim to those abuses and jeopardize their safety and that of their families and the public. Increasingly, they are leaving the company -- but while here, a crewmember surely will not risk safety or his or her career on behalf of a company that refuses to be up front about its failing operations and that has shown no ability to fix the problems it has brought upon itself."" ""Our counsel will vigorously defend us against the company's spurious charges,"" said Mr. Wells. ""Despite assurances to the court they would be transparent about their allegations, the company's counsel today denied a request for access to the data surrounding their accusations, which calls into question the veracity of their claims. We will develop our defense only after we see that data and subpoena their customers, such as DHL and Amazon, and company employees. Meanwhile, at a time when Atlas needs a team effort to dig themselves out of the hole they created,  the company has further alienated its pilots and employees by blaming them for managements failures. This will in no way serve the interests of its customers."" BACKGROUND On September 25th, Atlas Air, Inc. and Polar Air Cargo, two subsidiaries of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings AAWW, +2.03% filed a lawsuit against the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and its affiliate APA Teamsters Local 1224, which represents the airlines' pilots, alleging they are responsible for both the companies' scheduling failures and the growing scrutiny the carriers have received from increasing their customers. In February 2017, the company sued the union to try and force them into a process that would ""amalgamate"" the collective bargaining agreements of Atlas Air and sister company (also represented by the Teamsters) Southern Air. The union had rejected the company's plea as it would result in a CBA far below industry standards. That lawsuit continues in The United States District Court for Southern New York.

AAWW,"PURCHASE, New York, Sep 25, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Atlas Air, Inc. and Polar Air Cargo Worldwide, Inc., subsidiaries of Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings AAWW, +2.03% today announced they (collectively, ""Atlas"" or the ""Company"") are seeking a preliminary injunction to require the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Airline Division, and Local Union No. 1224 (collectively, the ""IBT"") to meet their obligations under the Railway Labor Act (""RLA"") and stop the illegal and intentional work slowdown and service interruptions they are causing. In its filing, the Company states the IBT is engaging in an unlawful, concerted work slowdown to gain advantage in pilot contract negotiations currently underway with the IBT. The illegal work slowdown and service interruptions are causing significant flight delays and harm to the Company and its valued customers. Atlas plays a major role in the global supply chain on a daily basis by transporting tons of time-sensitive cargo for customers. ""As the largest air cargo outsourcer in the world and the largest provider of commercial airlift for the U.S. military, businesses across the globe and millions of people depend on the stability, reliability, and viability of Atlas' day-to-day operations,"" said William J. Flynn, President and Chief Executive Officer of Atlas Air Worldwide. ""We value our commitment to our customers and the passengers and cargo entrusted to us. We must protect the service quality we provide to our customers."" The Company's request for a preliminary injunction was filed in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. In its filing, the Company states that the IBT has violated its status quo obligations under the RLA by encouraging the slowdown and failing to prevent and discourage it. The Company is asking the Court to compel the IBT to stop the illegal work action and return to normal operations. Atlas' customers have been notified of the steps the Company is taking to address the work slowdown. Atlas values the contributions of its pilots. The Company will continue to negotiate with the IBT for a joint contract for Atlas and Southern Air crewmembers in connection with the pending merger. The Company remains committed to completing the bargaining process in a timely manner and in the best interests of all parties.
