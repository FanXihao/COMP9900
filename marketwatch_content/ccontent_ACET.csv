ACET,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Among the stocks that could see active trade in Thursday’s session are Supervalu Inc., Men’s Wearhouse Inc. and VeriFone Systems Inc. Thursday’s roster of companies scheduled to report quarterly financial results includes Hovnanian Enterprises Inc. HOV, +0.55% Hooker Furniture Corp. HOFT, +1.66% Mattress Firm Holding Corp. MFRM Cherokee Inc. CHKE, +1.96% Cooper Cos. COO, +1.63% Met-Pro Corp. MPR Aceto Corp. ACET, +3.97% Lannett Co. LCI, +5.59% Ulta Beauty ULTA, -0.41% Quiksilver Inc. ZQK Layne Christensen Co. LAYN, +3.54% UTi Worldwide Inc. UTIW, +0.74% Smith & Wesson Holding Corp. SWHC  and Descartes Systems Group Inc. DSGX, +2.70% among others. TimeSUPERVALU Inc.15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:SVU $20.0 $15.0 $17.5 Supervalu SVU, -1.42%  will close some 60 stores that it characterized as “underperforming or non-strategic,” a majority of which are expected to be shut down before Dec. 1. Two of the stores had been previously targeted for closure. A total of 27 Albertsons stores will be closed — 19 in Southern California and the rest located elsewhere in the western U.S. Another 22 are Save-A-Lot locations, Minneapolis-based Supervalu said. The closings reflect management’s “commitment to move with a greater sense of urgency to reduce costs and improve shareholder value,” said Wayne Sales, president, chief executive and chairman, in a statement. The move will mean a pre-tax charge of $80 million to $90 million to be taken against Supervalu’s results for fiscal 2013; $3 million will be for estimated severance costs and the rest will be non-cash. Supervalu also said it will include a pre-tax gain of about $10 million from the sale of assets in results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013. The company estimated that the store closings will “be accretive to net earnings” and yield $80 million to $90 million in cash from selling off real estate, asset disposals and elimination of cash operating losses. The cash generated from these actions will be used by Supervalu to reduce outstanding debt, among other things. Citing constrained supplies in NAND flash memory, OCZ Technology Group Inc. OCZ, +0.00%  said it won’t meet management’s prior forecast for second-quarter sales. As revised, the San Jose-based data-storage company now sees sales in a range of $110 million to $120 million for the three months ended Aug. 31. This would be lower than the previously projected $130 million to $140 million and would come in well shy of analysts’ consensus $134.4 million forecast. OCZ will formally report results for the second quarter of fiscal 2013 on Oct. 3. Also late Wednesday, Men’s Wearhouse MW  raised its financial forecast for fiscal 2013 as the Houston-based retailer reported modestly higher earnings and sales for the second quarter ended July 28. Reflecting expectations for stronger sales growth in both the third and fourth quarters, management pegged earnings in a range of 95 cents to 98 cents a share in the current quarter, followed by swinging to an estimated profit of 12 cents to 15 cents a share in the fourth quarter. For the full fiscal year, management now sees Men’s Wearhouse generating earnings of $2.74 to $2.80 a share, which would be 15% to 18% higher than what it earned on an adjusted basis in the prior fiscal year. Fidelity National Financial Inc. FNF, +0.53%  agreed to raise the price of its tender offer for J. Alexander’s Corp. JAX, +4.09% the Nashville-based operator of casual dining restaurants, to $14.50 a share, up from $13 a share previously. J.

A majority of the total number of J. Alexander’s shares outstanding must be tendered for the offer to become effective. The transaction’s expected to close in the fourth quarter. Snyder’s-Lance Inc. LNCE  announced a deal to acquire Snack Factory LLC and certain affiliates, agreeing to pay 340 million in cash for the producer of Pretzel Crisps crackers. The acquisition will contribute, excluding transaction-related costs, 2 cents a share to earnings in 2012, followed by about 10 cents a share in 2013, Charlotte-based Snyder’s-Lance said. Snack Factory also is expected to add about $160 million to estimated net revenue for 2013. With the deal, Snyder’s-Lance said it will gain entry into the deli-bakery section of grocery stores and add a “fast- growing, differentiated national core brand to our existing portfolio.” It’s expected to close early in the fourth quarter. Terms of the acquisition include about $60 million of net present value of future tax benefits, Snyder’s-Lance said.

Net proceeds from the offerings will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include land acquisition and development, home construction, capital expenditures, working capital and debt repayment, Columbus, Ohio-based M/I Homes said. Zillow Inc. Z, +0.62%  will make a secondary offering of 3.5 million Class A shares, with existing stockholders seeking to sell about 9% of the shares going up for sale.

BreitBurn also said underwriters will have a 30-day greenshoe to buy up to 1.5 million additional common units, which represent limited-partner interests in the Los Angeles-based partnership.

""We believe the group's UK life funds, which have significant guaranteed annuity liabilities, may see greater capital requirements as a result of the introduction of realistic accounting,"" said Aitken. ""We do not expect RSA's share price to rally in the same way as Zurich's rose following its rights issue.""

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Executive Summary We are reporting net sales of $356,484 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, which represents a 40.6% increase from the $253,570 reported in the comparable prior period. Gross profit for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $73,953 and our gross margin was 20.7% as compared to gross profit of $61,644 and gross margin of 24.3% in the comparable prior period. Our selling, general and administrative costs (""SG&A"") for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was $59,212, an increase of $10,117 from what we reported in the prior period. We had a net (loss) of $(13,410), or $(0.38) per diluted share, compared to net income of $3,821, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the prior period. As more fully described in the notes to our condensed consolidated financial statements, on December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (""TCJA"") was signed by the U.S. President. The TCJA significantly changes the income tax environment for U.S. multinational corporations and as such, the Company recorded additional income tax expense of $13,909 in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. Our financial position as of December 31, 2017 remains strong, as we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $67,984, working capital of $238,776 and shareholders' equity of $397,023. Our business is separated into three principal segments: Human Health, Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals. Products that fall within the Human Health segment include finished dosage form generic drugs and nutraceutical products. Aceto sells generic prescription products and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products to leading wholesalers, chain drug stores, distributors and mass merchandisers. On December 21, 2016, Rising completed the acquisition of certain generic products and related assets of entities formerly known as Citron Pharma LLC (""Citron"") and its affiliate Lucid Pharma LLC (""Lucid""). Rising formed two subsidiaries to consummate the product acquisition - Rising Health, LLC (which acquired certain products and related assets of Citron) and Acetris Health, LLC (which acquired certain products and related assets of Lucid). Citron was a privately-held New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company focused on developing and marketing generic pharmaceutical products in partnership with leading generic pharmaceutical manufacturers based in India and the U.S. Lucid was a privately-held New Jersey-based generic pharmaceutical distributor specializing in providing cost-effective products to various agencies of the U.S. Federal Government including the Veterans Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency. Lucid serviced 18 national contracts with the Federal Government, nearly all of which have 5-year terms. The assets acquired in this transaction expand, complement, and strengthen our existing and future product offerings. In what has become a competitive generic drug business environment, one key for long-term success is having an ever-growing commercial portfolio of generic products, a strong internal drug development pipeline and capable, reliable manufacturing partners. This transaction adds significantly to the Rising business platform in all three crucial areas. We believe that, consistent with our strategy of expanding our portfolio of finished dosage form generic products through product development partnerships and acquisitions of late stage assets, abbreviated new drug applications (""ANDAs"") and complementary generic drug businesses, this product acquisition significantly expanded our roster of commercialized products and pipeline of products under development. In addition, we believe that this transaction greatly enhanced our size and stature within the generic pharmaceutical industry, expanded our partnership network and offers us opportunities to realize meaningful cost and tax efficiencies, as well as representing an integral component of Aceto's continued strategy to become a Human Health oriented company. According to a QuintilesIMS press release on May 5, 2017, growth in U.S. spending on prescription medicines fell in 2016 as competition intensified among manufacturers, and payers ramped up efforts to limit price increases. According to the QuintilesIMS Institute study, ""Drug spending grew at a 4.8 percent pace in 2016 to $323 billion, less than half the rate of the previous two years, after adjusting for off-invoice discounts and rebates. The surge of innovative medicine introductions paused in 2016, with fewer than half as many new drugs launched than in 2014 and 2015. While the total use of medicines continued to climb-with total prescriptions dispensed reaching 6.1 billion, up 3.3 percent over 2015 levels-the spike in new patients being treated for hepatitis C ebbed, which contributed to the decline in spend. Net price increases-reflecting rebates and other price breaks from manufacturers-averaged 3.5 percent last year, up from 2.5 percent in 2015."" Aceto supplies the raw materials used in the production of nutritional and packaged dietary supplements, including vitamins, amino acids, iron compounds and biochemicals used in pharmaceutical and nutritional preparations. The Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment has two product groups: Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and Pharmaceutical Intermediates. We supply APIs to many of the major generic drug companies, who we believe view Aceto as a valued partner in their effort to develop and market generic drugs. The process of introducing a new API from pipeline to market spans a number of years and begins with Aceto partnering with a generic pharmaceutical manufacturer and jointly selecting an API, several years before the expiration of a composition of matter patent, for future genericizing. We then identify the appropriate supplier, and concurrently utilizing our global technical network, work to ensure they meet standards of quality to comply with regulations. Our client, the generic pharmaceutical company, will submit the ANDA for U.S. Food and Drug Administration (""FDA"") approval or European-equivalent approval. The introduction of the API to market occurs after all the development testing has been completed and the ANDA or European-equivalent is approved and the patent expires or is deemed invalid. Aceto, at all times, has a pipeline of APIs at various stages of development both in the United States and Europe. Aceto has long been a supplier of pharmaceutical intermediates, the complex chemical compounds that are the building blocks used in producing APIs. These are the critical components of all drugs, whether they are already on the market or currently undergoing clinical trials. Faced with significant economic pressures as well as ever-increasing regulatory barriers, the innovative drug companies look to Aceto as a source for high quality intermediates. Aceto employs, on occasion, the same second source strategy for our pharmaceutical intermediates business that we use in our API business. Historically, pharmaceutical manufacturers have had one source for the intermediates needed to produce their products. Utilizing our global sourcing, regulatory support and quality assurance network, Aceto works with the large, global pharmaceutical companies, sourcing lower cost, quality pharmaceutical intermediates that will meet the same high level standards that their current commercial products adhere to. The Performance Chemicals segment includes specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products. Aceto is a major supplier to many different industrial segments providing chemicals used in the manufacture of plastics, surface coatings, cosmetics and personal care, textiles, fuels and lubricants. The paint and coatings industry produces products that bring color, texture, and protection to houses, furniture, packaging, paper, and durable goods. Many of today's coatings are eco-friendly, by allowing inks and coatings to be cured by ultraviolet light instead of solvents, or allowing power coatings to be cured without solvents. These growing technologies are critical in protecting and enhancing the world's ecology and Aceto is focused on supplying the specialty additives that make modern coating techniques possible. The chemistry that makes much of the modern world possible is often done by building up simple molecules to sophisticated compounds in step-by-step chemical processes. The products that are incorporated in each step are known as intermediates and they can be as varied as the end uses they serve, such as crop protection products, dyes and pigments, textiles, fuel additives, electronics - essentially all things chemical. Aceto provides various specialty chemicals for the food, flavor, fragrance, paper and film industries. Aceto's raw materials are also used in sophisticated technology products, such as high-end electronic parts used for photo tooling, circuit boards, production of computer chips, and in the production of many of today's modern gadgets. According to a January 17, 2018 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, in the fourth quarter of calendar year 2017, the index for consumer durables, which impacts the Specialty Chemicals business of the Performance Chemicals segment, is expected to increase at an annual rate of 8.5%. Aceto's agricultural protection products include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides, which control weed growth as well as the spread of insects and microorganisms that can severely damage plant growth. One of Aceto's most widely used agricultural protection products is a sprout inhibitor that extends the storage life of potatoes. Utilizing our global sourcing and regulatory capabilities, we identify and qualify manufacturers either producing the product or with knowledge of the chemistry necessary to produce the product, and then file an application with the U.S. EPA for a product registration. Aceto has an ongoing working relationship with manufacturers in China and India to determine which of the non-patented or generic, agricultural protection products they produce can be effectively marketed in the Western world. We have successfully brought numerous products to market. We have a strong pipeline, which includes future additions to our product portfolio. The combination of our global sourcing and regulatory capabilities makes the generic agricultural market a niche for us and we will continue to offer new product additions in this market. In the National Agricultural Statistics Services release dated June 30, 2017, the total crop acreage planted in the United States in 2017 decreased by .3% to 318 million acres from 319 million acres in 2016. The number of peanut acres planted in 2017 increased 8.8% from 2016 levels while sugarcane acreage harvested decreased 3.4% from 2016. In addition, the potato acreage harvested in 2017 increased approximately .7% from the 2016 level. We believe our main business strengths are sourcing, regulatory support, quality assurance, marketing and distribution. We distribute more than 1,100 chemical compounds used principally as finished products or raw materials in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, agricultural, coatings and industrial chemical industries. With business operations in ten countries, we believe that our global reach is distinctive in the industry, enabling us to source and supply quality products on a worldwide basis. Leveraging local professionals, we source approximately two-thirds of our products from Asia, buying from approximately 500 companies in China and 200 in India. In this MD&A, we explain our general financial condition and results of operations, including, among other things, the following: � factors that affect our business � our earnings and costs in the periods presented � changes in earnings and costs between periods � sources of earnings � the impact of these factors on our overall financial condition As you read this MD&A section, refer to the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of operations, which present the results of our operations for the three and six months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. We analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the condensed consolidated statements of operations. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies As disclosed in our 2017 10-K, the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing these financial statements, we were required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for bad debts, revenue recognition, partnered products, inventories, goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, long-lived assets, environmental and other contingencies, income taxes, stock-based compensation and purchase price allocation. We base our estimates on various factors, including historical experience, advice from outside subject-matter experts, and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which together form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Since June 30, 2017, there have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to those critical accounting estimates and policies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Six Months Ended December 31, 2017 Compared to Six Months Ended December 31, 2016 Net Sales by Segment Six months ended December 31, Comparison 2017 2017 2016 Over/(Under) 2016 % of % of $ % Segment Net sales Total Net sales Total Change Change Human Health $ 209,481 58.8 % $ 101,870 40.2 % $ 107,611 105.6 % Pharmaceutical Ingredients 70,205 19.7 77,432 30.5 (7,227 ) (9.3 ) Performance Chemicals 76,798 21.5 74,268 29.3 2,530 3.4 Net sales $ 356,484 100.0 % $ 253,570 100.0 % $ 102,914 40.6 % Gross Profit by Segment Six months ended December 31, Comparison 2017 2017 2016 Over/(Under) 2016 Gross % of Gross % of $ % Segment Profit Sales Profit Sales Change Change Human Health $ 47,545 22.7 % $ 31,124 30.6 % $ 16,421 52.8 % Pharmaceutical Ingredients 10,221 14.6 12,612 16.3 (2,391 ) (19.0 ) Performance Chemicals 16,187 21.1 17,908 24.1 (1,721 ) (9.6 ) Gross profit $ 73,953 20.7 % $ 61,644 24.3 % $ 12,309 20.0 %  Net Sales Net sales increased $102,914, or 40.6%, to $356,484 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $253,570 for the prior period. We reported sales increases in our Human Health and Performance Chemicals segments and a decrease in our Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment. Human Health Net sales for the Human Health segment increased by $107,611 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, to $209,481, which represents a 105.6% increase over net sales of $101,870 for the prior period. The primary reason for the increase is due to the acquisition of certain products and related assets of Citron and Lucid. Sales from the product acquisition of $113,850 are included in the six months ended December 31, 2017. In addition, there was a rise of $2,964 in sales of nutritional products, sold abroad, primarily by our German subsidiary. These increases in Human Health were offset in part, by a decline in sales of other Rising products due to continued pricing pressure, consolidation of customers and softer than expected contributions from new product launches. Pharmaceutical Ingredients Net sales for the Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment decreased $7,227 or 9.3% to $70,205 when compared to the prior period net sales of $77,432. The decrease in sales for this segment was due primarily to a decline in sales of domestic APIs of $4,119, mainly due to reduced orders of a customer-launched API, timing of sales of three products that are expected to be shipped in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year 2018, delayed customer launch of an API, competition on another API and the discontinuance of two finish dosage drugs sold by our API business unit. These decreases in domestic APIs were offset in part by customer launches of certain new products. In addition, APIs sold abroad decreased $1,313, specifically in Germany. Sales of intermediates sold abroad have decreased $1,418 from the prior period primarily occurring in Germany, due to a supplier interruption and timing of orders for certain intermediate products that was pushed to the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2018. Performance Chemicals Net sales for the Performance Chemicals segment was $76,798 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, representing an increase of $2,530 or 3.4%, from net sales of $74,268 for the prior period. The Specialty Chemicals business experienced a rise in sales of $8,029 over the prior period. The rise in Specialty Chemicals sales is partly due to an increase in domestic sales of $5,482, primarily from increased sales of agricultural and pigment intermediates as well as surface coatings. In addition, sales of specialty chemical products sold abroad, increased $2,547 over the prior period, predominantly at our subsidiary in Germany. Performance Chemicals sales were impacted by a $5,499 drop in sales of our agricultural protection products, predominantly from a decline in sales of a fungicide used to prevent disease on pecan crops and an herbicide used to treat weeds on rice crops. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $12,309 to $73,953 (20.7% of net sales) for the six months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to $61,644 (24.3% of net sales) for the prior period. Human Health Human Health segment's gross profit of $47,545 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased $16,421, or 52.8%, over the prior period. The gross margin of 22.7% was lower than the prior period's gross margin of 30.6%. The increase in Human Health's gross profit was partially related to gross profit of $25,321 on sales from the product acquisition, which is included in the six months ended December 31, 2017. This increase was partially offset by the decline of gross profit and gross margin on other Rising products, primarily driven by unfavorable product mix on certain products, increased competition and consolidation of customers. Pharmaceutical Ingredients Pharmaceutical Ingredients' gross profit of $10,221 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $2,391, or 19.0%, over the prior period. The gross margin of 14.6% was lower than the prior period's gross margin of 16.3%. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin was predominantly the result of the decrease in the sales volume of APIs sold domestically, as well as a drop in reorders of a certain API which typically yields a significantly higher gross margin. In addition, our international subsidiaries experienced an unfavorable product mix on API sales. Performance Chemicals Gross profit for the Performance Chemicals segment decreased to $16,187 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, versus $17,908 for the prior year, a decrease of $1,721 or 9.6%. The gross margin at 21.1% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 was lower than the prior year's gross margin of 24.1%. The decrease in gross profit was due to a $2,248 decline in gross profit for the Agricultural Protection Products business, as a result of the sales volume decline. The drop in gross margin from the prior period is a result of an unfavorable product mix on sales of specialty chemical products sold both domestically and in Germany. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A of $59,212 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased $10,117 or 20.6% from $49,095 reported for the prior period. As a percentage of sales, SG&A decreased to 16.6% for the six months ended December 31, 2017 versus 19.4% in the prior period. SG&A for the current period included $10,730 of amortization expense associated with the purchased intangible assets related to the product purchase. We recorded $4,064 of one-time costs associated with the separation of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, including $2,017 of stock-based compensation. In addition, SG&A increased due to a $902 environmental charge related to Arsynco. The increase in SG&A is also due in part to approximately $644 of consulting services provided by former Citron and Lucid employees in connection with the Transition Services Agreement associated with the product purchase agreement, as well as approximately $1,274 of outsourcing fees related to the accounting processes of Rising Health and Acetris Health. SG&A for the prior period included $9,009 of transaction costs related to the product purchase agreement. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses (""R&D"") increased to $3,737 for the six months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $2,391 for the prior period. R&D expenses represent investment in our generic finished dosage form product pipeline. The majority of the R&D expenses are milestone based, which was the primary cause for such increase and will likely cause fluctuation from quarter to quarter. Operating Income For the six months ended December 31, 2017 operating income was $11,004 compared to $10,158 in the prior period, an increase of $846 or 8.3%. Interest Expense Interest expense was $10,403 for the six months ended December 31, 2017, an increase of $5,501 or 112.2% from the prior period. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which was entered into on December 21, 2016 to help fund our product acquisition, as well as additional interest associated with the $50,000 unsecured deferred payment related to the product acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the six months ended December 31, 2017 increased to 918.2% compared to 34.6% for the prior period. In accordance with the TCJA, for the six months ended December 31, 2017, we recorded additional income tax expense of $13,909. In addition, we recorded $1,101 of additional income tax expense associated with net tax deficiencies under ASU 2016-09, which was . . . Feb 02, 2018 (c) 1995-2018 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

The following Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to provide the readers of our financial statements with a narrative discussion about our business. The MD&A is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Executive Summary We are reporting net sales of $185,255 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, which represents a 44.7% increase from the $128,018 reported in the comparable prior period. Gross profit for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $39,983 and our gross margin was 21.6% as compared to gross profit of $30,839 and gross margin of 24.1% in the comparable prior period. Our selling, general and administrative costs (""SG&A"") for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $31,149, an increase of $10,125 from what we reported in the prior period. Our net income decreased to $454, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4,385, or $0.15 per diluted share, in the prior period. As more fully described below, results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 reflect the Company's acquisition in December 2016 of certain generic products and related assets of entities formerly known as Citron Pharma LLC (""Citron""), and its affiliate Lucid Pharma LLC (""Lucid""). Our financial position as of September 30, 2017 remains strong, as we had cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments of $75,148, working capital of $240,551 and shareholders' equity of $409,230. Our business is separated into three principal segments: Human Health, Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals. Products that fall within the Human Health segment include finished dosage form generic drugs and nutraceutical products. Aceto sells generic prescription products and over-the-counter pharmaceutical products to leading wholesalers, chain drug stores, distributors and mass merchandisers. On December 21, 2016, Rising completed the acquisition of certain generic products and related assets of Citron and Lucid. Rising formed two subsidiaries to consummate the product acquisition - Rising Health, LLC (which acquired certain products and related assets of Citron) and Acetris Health, LLC (which acquired certain products and related assets of Lucid). Citron was a privately-held New Jersey-based pharmaceutical company focused on developing and marketing generic pharmaceutical products in partnership with leading generic pharmaceutical manufacturers based in India and the U.S. Lucid was a privately-held New Jersey-based generic pharmaceutical distributor specializing in providing cost-effective products to various agencies of the U.S. Federal Government including the Veterans Administration and the Defense Logistics Agency.

According to an October 17, 2017 Federal Reserve Statistical Release, in the third quarter of calendar year 2017, the index for consumer durables, which impacts the Specialty Chemicals business of the Performance Chemicals segment, is expected to decrease at an annual rate of 6.4%. Aceto's agricultural protection products include herbicides, fungicides and insecticides, which control weed growth as well as the spread of insects and microorganisms that can severely damage plant growth. One of Aceto's most widely used agricultural protection products is a sprout inhibitor that extends the storage life of potatoes. Utilizing our global sourcing and regulatory capabilities, we identify and qualify manufacturers either producing the product or with knowledge of the chemistry necessary to produce the product, and then file an application with the U.S. EPA for a product registration. Aceto has an ongoing working relationship with manufacturers in China and India to determine which of the non-patented or generic, agricultural protection products they produce can be effectively marketed in the Western world. We have successfully brought numerous products to market. We have a strong pipeline, which includes future additions to our product portfolio. The combination of our global sourcing and regulatory capabilities makes the generic agricultural market a niche for us and we will continue to offer new product additions in this market. In the National Agricultural Statistics Services release dated June 30, 2017, the total crop acreage planted in the United States in 2017 decreased by .3% to 318 million acres from 319 million acres in 2016. The number of peanut acres planted in 2017 increased 8.8% from 2016 levels while sugarcane acreage harvested decreased 3.4% from 2016. In addition, the potato acreage harvested in 2017 increased approximately .7% from the 2016 level. We believe our main business strengths are sourcing, regulatory support, quality assurance, marketing and distribution. We distribute more than 1,100 chemical compounds used principally as finished products or raw materials in the pharmaceutical, nutraceutical, agricultural, coatings and industrial chemical industries. With business operations in ten countries, we believe that our global reach is distinctive in the industry, enabling us to source and supply quality products on a worldwide basis. Leveraging local professionals, we source approximately two-thirds of our products from Asia, buying from approximately 500 companies in China and 200 in India. In this MD&A, we explain our general financial condition and results of operations, including, among other things, the following: � factors that affect our business � our earnings and costs in the periods presented � changes in earnings and costs between periods � sources of earnings � the impact of these factors on our overall financial condition As you read this MD&A section, refer to the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income, which present the results of our operations for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. We analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the condensed consolidated statements of income. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies As disclosed in our Form 10-K for the year ended June 30, 2017, the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. In preparing these financial statements, we were required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We regularly evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for bad debts, revenue recognition, partnered products, inventories, goodwill and indefinite-life intangible assets, long-lived assets, environmental and other contingencies, income taxes, stock-based compensation and purchase price allocation. We base our estimates on various factors, including historical experience, advice from outside subject-matter experts, and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, which together form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. Since June 30, 2017, there have been no significant changes to the assumptions and estimates related to those critical accounting estimates and policies. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended September 30, 2016 Net Sales by Segment Three months ended September 30, Comparison 2017 2017 2016 Over/(Under) 2016 % of % of $ % Segment Net sales Total Net sales Total Change Change Human Health $ 106,015 57.2 % $ 47,889 37.4 % $ 58,126 121.4 % Pharmaceutical Ingredients 36,576 19.8 40,616 31.7 (4,040 ) (9.9 ) Performance Chemicals 42,664 23.0 39,513 30.9 3,151 8.0 Net sales $ 185,255 100.0 % $ 128,018 100.0 % $ 57,237 44.7 % Gross Profit by Segment Three months ended September 30, Comparison 2017 2017 2016 Over/(Under) 2016 Gross % of Gross % of $ % Segment Profit Sales Profit Sales Change Change Human Health $ 24,647 23.2 % $ 14,205 29.7 % $ 10,442 73.5 % Pharmaceutical Ingredients 5,840 16.0 6,954 17.1 (1,114 ) (16.0 ) Performance Chemicals 9,496 22.3 9,680 24.5 (184 ) (1.9 ) Gross profit $ 39,983 21.6 % $ 30,839 24.1 % $ 9,144 29.7 %  Net Sales Net sales increased $57,237, or 44.7%, to $185,255 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared with $128,018 for the prior period. We reported sales increases in our Human Health and Performance Chemicals segments and a decrease in our Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment. Human Health Net sales for the Human Health segment increased by $58,126 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, to $106,015, which represents a 121.4% increase over net sales of $47,889 for the prior period. The primary reason for the increase is due to the acquisition of certain products and related assets of Citron and Lucid. Sales from the product acquisition of $55,130 are included in the three months ended September 30, 2017. Pharmaceutical Ingredients Net sales for the Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment decreased $4,040 or 9.9% to $36,576 when compared to the prior period net sales of $40,616. The decrease in sales for this segment was due primarily to a decline in sales of domestic APIs of $2,792, mainly due to reduced orders of a customer-launched API, as well as a drop in customer demand for two other API products, sold in the U.S. Domestic sales of intermediates have decreased $1,036 from the prior period due to customer inventory reduction and a delay in timing of orders for certain intermediate products. Performance Chemicals Net sales for the Performance Chemicals segment was $42,664 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, representing an increase of $3,151 or 8.0%, from net sales of $39,513 for the prior period. Specialty Chemicals business experienced a rise in sales of $4,251 over the prior period. The rise in Specialty Chemicals sales is partly due to an increase in domestic sales of $1,658, primarily from increased sales of agricultural and pigment intermediates. In addition, sales of specialty chemical products sold abroad, increased $2,593 over the prior period, predominantly at our subsidiaries in France and Germany. Performance Chemicals sales were impacted by a $1,100 drop in sales of our agricultural protection products, predominantly from a decline in sales of a fungicide used to prevent disease on pecan crops, which we expect to sell in our second quarter of fiscal year 2018. Gross Profit Gross profit increased $9,144 to $39,983 (21.6% of net sales) for the three months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to $30,839 (24.1% of net sales) for the prior period. Human Health Human Health segment's gross profit of $24,647 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 increased $10,442, or 73.5%, over the prior period. The gross margin of 23.2% was lower than the prior period's gross margin of 29.7%, but consistent with quarters subsequent to the product acquisition. The increase in Human Health's gross profit was partially related to gross profit of $11,332 on sales from the product acquisition, which is included in the three months ended September 30, 2017. This increase was partially offset by the decline of gross profit and gross margin on other Rising products, primarily driven by unfavorable product mix on certain products and increased competition. Pharmaceutical Ingredients Pharmaceutical Ingredients' gross profit of $5,840 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 decreased $1,114, or 16.0%, over the prior period. The gross margin of 16.0% was lower than the prior period's gross margin of 17.1%. The decrease in gross profit and gross margin was predominantly the result of the decrease in the sales volume of APIs sold domestically, as well as a drop in reorders of a certain API which typically yields a significantly higher gross margin. In addition, our international subsidiaries experienced an unfavorable product mix on API sales. Performance Chemicals Gross profit for the Performance Chemicals segment decreased to $9,496 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, versus $9,680 for the prior year, a decrease of $184 or 1.9%. The gross margin at 22.3% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was lower than the prior year's gross margin of 24.5%. The decrease in gross profit was due to a $429 decline in gross profit for the Agricultural Protection Products business, as a result of the sales volume decline. The drop in gross margin from the prior period is a result of an unfavorable product mix on sales of specialty chemical products sold domestically. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses SG&A of $31,149 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 increased $10,125 or 48.2% from $21,024 reported for the prior period. As a percentage of sales, SG&A increased to 16.8% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 versus 16.4% in the prior period. SG&A for the current period included $5,379 of amortization expense associated with the purchased intangible assets related to the product purchase. We recorded $4,064 of one-time costs associated with the separation of the Company's former Chief Executive Officer, including $2,017 of stock-based compensation. In addition, SG&A increased due to a $902 environmental charge related to Arsynco. The increase in SG&A is also due in part to approximately $325 of consulting services provided by former Citron and Lucid employees in connection with the Transition Services Agreement associated with the product purchase agreement, as well as approximately $680 of outsourcing fees related to the accounting processes of Rising Health and Acetris Health. SG&A for the prior period included $1,809 of transaction costs related to the product purchase agreement. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses (""R&D"") increased to $1,615 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $1,050 for the prior period. R&D expenses represent investment in our generic finished dosage form product pipeline. The majority of the R&D expenses are milestone based, which was the primary cause for such increase and will likely cause fluctuation from quarter to quarter. Operating Income For the three months ended September 30, 2017 operating income was $7,219 compared to $8,765 in the prior period, a decrease of $1,546 or 17.6%. Interest Expense Interest expense was $5,355 for the three months ended September 30 2017, an increase of $3,122 or 139.8% from the prior period. The increase was primarily due to interest expense associated with the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which was entered into on December 21, 2016 to help fund our product acquisition, as well as additional interest associated with the $50,000 unsecured deferred payment related to the product acquisition. Provision for Income Taxes The effective tax rate for the three months ended September 30, 2017 increased to 78.8% compared to 35.3% for the prior period. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, we recorded $1,128 of additional income tax expense associated with net tax deficiencies under ASU 2016-09, which was adopted in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash Flows At September 30, 2017, we had $72,100 in cash, of which $47,050 was outside the United States, $3,048 in short-term investments, all of which is held outside the United States, and $331,579 in long-term debt (including the current portion), all of which is an obligation in the United States. Working capital was $240,551 at September 30, 2017 compared to $248,750 at June 30, 2017. The $47,050 of cash held outside of the United States is fully accessible to meet any liquidity needs of our business located in any of the countries in which we operate. The majority of the cash located outside of the United States is held by our European operations and can be transferred into the United States. Although these amounts are fully accessible, transferring these amounts into the United States or any other countries could have certain tax consequences. We intend to indefinitely reinvest these undistributed earnings and have no plan . . . Nov 03, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

ACET,"PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., Feb 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- ACETO Corporation ACET, +3.97% an international company engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of Human Health products, Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals, has been notified by the U.S. government that 11 generic drug products it acquired through its Acetris Health subsidiary in a product purchase agreement with an entity formerly known as Lucid Pharma LLC are not in compliance with the federal Trade Agreement Act (""TAA"") country-of-origin provisions of a clause contained in the government supply contracts. The 11 finished dosage form products purchased by the U.S. government are manufactured by Aurolife Pharma LLC which is located in Dayton, New Jersey using APIs sourced from India. In conjunction with this finding, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (""VA"") has requested that ACETO supply new TAA-compliant sources for the referenced products by March 9, 2018 and supply new TAA-compliant drugs to the government purchasers under the contracts by March 26, 2018. Commenting on this matter, William C. Kennally, III, Chief Executive Officer of ACETO, said, ""We are concerned about the VA's request since Acetris' U.S. manufacturing partner has sourced APIs from India for the 11 products in question at least since ACETO assumed its supply contracts with the VA. We have also heard from other suppliers to the VA who report that they too source APIs from India and have the finished dosage form manufactured in the United States. Finally, we do not believe that supplying the U.S. government with product containing an API originating in India is a deviation from industry practice. ""As a practical matter, the compressed deadline for finding a replacement API as required by the VA is simply neither realistic nor attainable given the regulatory process required by the FDA. Nevertheless, we are taking all necessary steps to address the agency's concerns and ensure an uninterrupted supply of product to our veterans. These generic drug products reduce the price the VA pays on behalf of veterans. They are the same products sold commercially and generic drugs could not be offered to the VA at such low prices if the ingredients used to make them cannot be sourced from the primary manufacturers of pharmaceutical chemicals. However, in the event that our supply contracts with the VA are terminated, we do not believe the financial impact to the company's fiscal 2018 non-GAAP EPS will be material."" Under current longstanding law, the government, under the Buy America Act, is permitted to buy domestic end products, including commercial off-the-shelf (""COTS"") products like generic drugs that are manufactured in the U.S. even if their components are not all manufactured in the US. ACETO thus believes that the government was and is permitted to buy Acetris' products, because they are COTS items manufactured in the U.S. As a result, ACETO disputes the determination that the 11 products sold pursuant to novated contracts with the VA originate in India rather than the United States and intends to appeal the decision that it is not currently compliant with contract sourcing requirements. To further pursue remedies, ACETO has asserted an indemnification claim against the sellers under the product purchase agreement dated December 21, 2016. As previously disclosed in the company's Form 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the U.S. government had advised Acetris that it was reviewing whether Acetris' supply of 11 products under its government contracts complied with the country-of-origin clause. ACETO has also filed a Form 8-K with the SEC today with respect to this matter. ABOUT ACETO ACETO Corporation, incorporated in 1947 and with offices and operations in 10 countries, is engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of Human Health products (finished dosage form generics and nutraceuticals), Pharmaceutical Ingredients (pharmaceutical intermediates and active pharmaceutical ingredients) and Performance Chemicals (specialty chemicals and agricultural protection products).

The Company's adjusted EBITDA margin of 33.2% decreased 160 basis points from the prior year, primarily driven by the China contract termination/plant sale and higher energy pass-through. For Q1 FY18, Air Product reported GAAP net income from continuing operations of $156 million and GAAP diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations of $0.70, down 38% and 39%, respectively from Q1 FY17, The Company's reported quarter results included a net $239 million, or $1.09 per share, charge related to the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act).

During Q1 FY18, Industrial Gases - Asia's sales of $644 million surged 47% on a y-o-y basis, mainly due to the contract termination/plant sale in China; excluding this, volumes grew 8% on a y-o-y from new plants and strong base merchant business.

ACET,"PORT WASHINGTON, N.Y., Feb 01, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- ACETO Corporation ACET, +3.97% an international company engaged in the development, marketing, sale and distribution of Human Health products, Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals, announced today financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 ended December 31, 2017. Second Quarter Fiscal 2018 versus Second Quarter Fiscal 2017 Net sales of $171.2 million versus $125.6 million, a 36.4% increase Gross profit of $34.0 million versus $30.8 million, a 10.3% increase Net loss of $13.9 million versus net loss of $0.6 million Net loss includes $13.9 million of additional income tax expense associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA"") Diluted EPS loss of $0.39 versus loss of $0.02 Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income of $7.6 million versus $7.3 million, a 4.7% increase Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS of $0.22 versus $0.24, an 8.3% decrease Management Commentary ""Our second fiscal quarter results reflect primarily the persistence of generic industry headwinds marked by greater competitive intensity and the impact from customer consolidations. Even as sales benefited from the addition of Citron and Lucid products, pricing pressures on our more mature Rising products and softer than expected contributions from new product launches caused a contraction in Human Health's gross margin,"" said William C. Kennally, III, Chief Executive Officer of ACETO. ""Notwithstanding these pricing pressures, a 35% increase in Human Health gross profit more than offset gross profit declines reported by our Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals segments. ""As we look to the second half of fiscal 2018, our operating assumption is the generic industry headwinds will not ease in the near term and we now have greater clarity on the impact of harmonization from customer consolidations. Adverse market conditions are impacting the sales, profitability and market share of certain Rising products to a greater degree than anticipated and a number of API projects which were scheduled to be monetized in the second half of the year have been discontinued. As a result of these factors, although we remain on track to launch 15-20 generic products this year, we are reducing our outlook for fiscal year sales and profitability and now expect our overall results for the second half of the year to be only modestly better than the first half,"" added Mr Kennally. ""Our healthy balance sheet and solid operating cash generation support our ability to weather the generics industry storm. At the same time, we continue to focus on optimizing Rising's commercialized portfolio of products and pipeline of projects to improve profitability in the future; we're advancing operational initiatives designed to enhance efficiencies; and, identifying ways to take costs out of the system. We continue to expect to have our new warehouse facility fully functional and our new ERP system implemented by the end of the year, at which point we will realize the full syngergy value of $4 million on an annualized basis. With an integrated platform in place at Rising and a healthy flow of products to be launched, we firmly believe we are taking the right steps to ensure ACETO is properly positioned to improve the company's growth rate and profitability,"" concluded Mr. Kennally. Please see fiscal 2018 guidance provided within this press release after the financial review. Second Quarter Financial Review Net sales for the second quarter of fiscal 2018 were $171.2 million, an increase of 36.4% from $125.6 million reported in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Total Company gross profit was $34.0 million, an increase of 10.3%, compared to $30.8 million in the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the second quarter was 19.8% compared to 24.5% in the prior year period. Human Health segment sales were $103.5 million, an increase of 91.7%, compared to $54.0 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. This quarter included $58.7 million in sales from the acquisition of certain products and related assets of Citron and Lucid. Gross profit for the Human Health segment was $22.9 million, an increase of 35.3%, compared to $16.9 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting the addition of certain products and related assets of Citron and Lucid. Gross margin for the second quarter was 22.1%, compared to 31.3% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was due to the addition of relatively lower gross margin from the Citron and Lucid products and to the decline of gross profit for other Rising products. Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment sales were $33.6 million, a decrease of 8.7%, compared to $36.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The segment's sales decrease was driven by lower sales of both domestic and international APIs. Gross profit in the quarter was $4.4 million, a 22.6% decrease compared to $5.7 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the second quarter was 13.0%, compared to 15.4% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit and margin was driven by lower sales of domestic and international APIs and a less favorable product mix of international API sales. Performance Chemicals segment sales were $34.1 million, a decrease of 1.8% compared to $34.8 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017, as higher sales of specialty chemicals largely offset of lowers sales agricultural protection products. Gross profit was $6.7 million, a decrease of 18.7%, compared to $8.2 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin was 19.6% for the second quarter, compared to 23.7% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit was due to lower gross profit on agricultural protection products, while the decrease in gross margin was largely due to a less favorable product mix of specialty chemical products. Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $28.1 million, unchanged versus the same period last year, with $5.4 million in the current quarter attributable to amortization expense associated with the purchase of intangible assets related to the Citron and Lucid product purchase. SG&A for the prior year's period included $7.2 million of transaction costs related to the product purchase agreement. As a percentage of sales, SG&A for the second quarter of 2018 declined to 16.4% compared to 22.4% in the prior year's period. Research and Development expenses in the second quarter totaled $2.1 million compared to $1.3 million in the prior year period. The majority of R&D expenses are milestone based and fluctuate quarterly. Operating income totaled $3.8 million, an increase of 171.7% from the second quarter of fiscal 2017. The TCJA, signed into law on December 22, 2017, impacted second fiscal quarter results in two ways. First, the Company recorded an additional income tax expense of $13.9 million, comprised of $3.2 million related to the remeasurement of deferred tax assets arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate, $5.8 million related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and $4.9 million related to deferred tax liabilities for local tax authorities. Second, the Company's effective domestic tax rate declined from 38.0% to 31.5% for the first half of the fiscal year, resulting in a tax benefit of $0.06 per diluted share on a non-GAAP basis. Net loss was $13.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, compared to net loss of $0.6 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter of fiscal 2017. Included in the net loss was an additional income tax expense of $13.9 million or $0.39 per share related to the TCJA impact. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income was $7.6 million in the second quarter, compared to $7.3 million in the prior period, a 4.7% increase. Non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings per Share were $0.22, compared to $0.24 in the year ago second quarter, an 8.3% decrease. Fiscal 2018 Guidance For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, at current exchange rates, ACETO is providing financial guidance as follows: Total revenues to increase approximately 10% to 15%; Reported diluted GAAP loss per share between $(0.22) and $(0.32); Diluted Non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.00 and $1.05. The Company's fiscal 2018 financial guidance is based in part on the following assumptions: Generic industry headwinds continued in our second fiscal quarter and we are expecting annual price erosion in the low double digits percentage; Reported diluted GAAP loss per share includes an additional tax expense of $0.39 related to the TCJA R&D expense of approximately $9.0 million; and, Total generic product launches of 15 to 20.

Words such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""expect,"" ""believe,"" ""anticipate,"" ""project,"" ""plan,"" ""intend,"" ""estimate,"" and ""continue,"" and their opposites and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this press release include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the Company's strategic initiatives including selling finished dosage form generic drugs, and statements regarding the prospects for long-term growth. ACETO cautions you that these statements are not guarantees of future performance or events and are subject to a number of uncertainties, risks and other influences, many of which are beyond ACETO's control, which may influence the accuracy of the statements and the projections upon which the statements are based. Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those set forth or implied by any forward-looking statement include, but are not limited to, risks and uncertainties discussed in ACETO's reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including, but not limited to, ACETO's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017 and other filings, including Amendment No. 1 on Form 10-K/A to our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. Copies of these filings are available at www.sec.gov. Any one or more of these uncertainties, risks and other influences could materially affect ACETO's results of operations and whether forward-looking statements made by ACETO ultimately prove to be accurate. In addition, periodic high-margin product sales may have a positive material financial impact in a given quarter that may be non-recurring in future quarters, thereby rendering one quarter's performance not useful as a predictor of future quarters' results. ACETO's actual results, performance and achievements could differ materially from those expressed or implied in these forward-looking statements. ACETO undertakes no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether from new information, future events or otherwise.

First Quarter Fiscal 2018 versus First Quarter Fiscal 2017 Net sales of $185.3 million versus $128.0 million, a 44.7% increase Gross profit of $40.0 million versus $30.8 million, a 29.7% increase Net income of $0.5 million versus $4.4 million, a 89.6% decrease Diluted EPS of $0.01 versus $0.15, an 93.3% decrease Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income of $10.7 million versus $8.3 million, a 29.1% increase Non-GAAP Adjusted EPS of $0.30 versus $0.28, a 7.1% increase Management Commentary ""Our legacy Rising Pharmaceuticals business posted its first year-over-year increase in quarterly sales in over a year, supported by new product launches in the second half of fiscal 2017. In addition, Human Health segment sales benefited from the addition of the Citron and Lucid products. However, pricing pressure on the more mature products in the legacy Rising portfolio and the inclusion of the Citron and Lucid products, which carry a lower gross margin, contributed to a contraction in segment profitability,"" said William C. Kennally, III, Chief Executive Officer of ACETO. ""On the strength of the cash flow generated by our stable Pharmaceutical Ingredients and Performance Chemicals segments and a significant improvement in our Human Health accounts receivable collections, we generated $44 million in operating cash flow, which gave us ample funds to pay down $24 million of long-term debt for a leverage ratio of 3.71x at quarter end. ""While our first quarter results were largely in-line with our expectations and we still plan to launch 15 to 20 products in fiscal 2018, the timing of some of our product launches will be delayed due to API constraints and technical challenges, issues which we expect to fully resolve as the year progresses. Additionally, our current view of industry conditions is now indicating greater than previously expected headwinds in terms of both competitive intensity and the impact from ongoing customer consolidations. As a result, we are lowering our net sales and profit guidance. Nevertheless, we believe we remain well positioned to weather what has become a prolonged generics industry downturn and grow net sales, based on the steady supply of new products to launch, our strong balance sheet and our steady cash generating businesses. With our large and diversified portfolio of 140 generic drug products and robust pipeline of 115 product candidates, consisting of 60 ANDAs approved or on file at the FDA and 55 products under development, our strategic transition toward human health will continue to move forward,"" concluded Mr. Kennally. Please see fiscal 2018 guidance provided within this press release after the financial review. First Quarter Financial Review Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2018 were $185.3 million, an increase of 44.7% from $128.0 million reported in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Total Company gross profit was $40.0 million, an increase of 29.7%, compared to $30.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the first quarter was 21.6% compared to 24.1% in the prior year period. Human Health segment sales were $106.0 million, an increase of 121.4%, compared to $47.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The revenue increase primarily reflects the addition of $55.1 million from the acquisition of certain products and related assets of Citron and Lucid. Gross profit for the Human Health segment was $24.6 million, an increase of 73.5%, compared to $14.2 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, reflecting the addition of certain products and related assets of Citron and Lucid. Gross margin for the first quarter was 23.2%, compared to 29.7% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross margin was due to the addition of relatively lower gross margin from the Citron and Lucid products and to the decline of gross profit for certain legacy Rising products. Pharmaceutical Ingredients segment sales were $36.6 million, a decrease of 9.9%, compared to $40.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. The segment's sales decrease was driven by lower sales of domestic APIs. Gross profit in the quarter was $5.8 million, a 16.0% decrease compared to $7.0 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin for the first quarter was 16.0%, compared to 17.1% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit and margin was driven by lower sales of domestic APIs and a less favorable product mix in APIs. Performance Chemicals segment sales were $42.7 million, an increase of 8.0% compared to $39.5 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017, largely due to higher sales of agricultural and pigment intermediates in the Specialty Chemicals business. Gross profit was $9.5 million, a decrease of 1.9%, compared to $9.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross margin was 22.3% for the first quarter, compared to 24.5% in the prior year period. The decrease in gross profit and margin was primarily due to lower sales of certain agricultural protection products and a less favorable product mix of specialty chemical products. Total selling, general and administrative expenses were $31.1 million compared to $21.0 million in the same period last year, a 48.2% increase, with $5.4 million of the increase attributable to amortization expense associated with the purchase of intangible assets related to the Citron and Lucid product purchase. Also included in selling, general and administrative expenses for the first quarter of 2018 were $4.1 million of one-time costs associated with the departure of the company's former CEO. Research and Development expenses in the first quarter totaled $1.6 million compared to $1.1 million in the prior year period. The majority of R&D expenses are milestone based and fluctuate quarterly. Operating income totaled $7.2 million, a decrease of 17.6% from the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Net income was $0.5 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted share, for the comparable quarter of fiscal 2017. Non-GAAP Adjusted Net Income was $10.7 million in the first quarter, compared to $8.3 million in the prior period, a 29.1% increase. Non-GAAP Adjusted Earnings per Share were $0.30, compared to $0.28 in the year ago first quarter, a 7.1% increase. Fiscal 2018 Guidance For the fiscal year ending June 30, 2018, at current exchange rates, ACETO is providing financial guidance as follows: Total revenues to increase approximately 15% to 20%; Reported diluted GAAP earnings per share between $0.23 and $0.33; Diluted Non-GAAP earnings per share between $1.05 and $1.15. The Company's fiscal 2018 financial guidance is based in part on the following assumptions: Generic industry headwinds continued in our first fiscal quarter and we are expecting annual price erosion in the low double digits percentage; R&D expense of approximately $10 million; and Total generic product launches of 15 to 20.

These measures, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS, are based upon net income excluding amortization of intangibles, debt extinguishment, amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs, transaction costs related to acquisitions and the impact of Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-09. These items should not be reviewed in isolation or considered substitutes of the Company's financial results as reported in accordance with GAAP. Due to the nature of these items, it is important to identify these items and to review them in conjunction with the Company's financial results reported in accordance with GAAP. The exclusion of these items also allows investors to compare results of operations in the current period to prior periods' results based on the Company's fundamental business performance and analyze the operating trends of the business. The exclusion of these items also allows management to evaluate the performance of its business units. Pursuant to the requirements of Regulation G, reconciliations of Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted EPS to U.S. GAAP net income and GAAP EPS are presented in the table Non-GAAP Reconciliation of this press release.
