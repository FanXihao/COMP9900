ACHV,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — Think small if you are hoping to exploit the January Effect this month. In fact, think tiny. TRADING STRATEGIES: JANUARY Investing in 2013 MarketWatch photo illustration   The biggest question facing investors in 2013 may simply be how much trading to do. • Don’t be afraid to trade • How special is January? • Kicking the trading habit • Small is beautiful, tiny is even better • Pair trades for a more profitable 2013 • Trading Strategies for January 2013 » That’s because, to the extent this seasonal pattern works, it is concentrated in the tiniest of companies. For the large-cap stocks that dominate the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500, in contrast, the January Effect is hardly big enough to pay for transaction costs. This should not come as a surprise, by the way. On the contrary, it’s right in line with the findings of the original academic research that, several decades ago, documented the existence of the January Effect. That research found that seasonal strength right after New Year’s tends to be concentrated among the stocks of the very smallest companies. How small? If we apply to today’s stock market the criterion employed by that original research, a stock’s market cap would need to be less than around $200 million. That’s tiny. To put that in perspective, consider that Apple’s market cap is nearly $500 billion, or more than two thousand times larger. January of a year ago provided a textbook illustration of the January Effect’s concentrated impact on the tiniest companies. The Dow in the first month of 2011 gained 3.4%. The iShares Russell Micro-Cap Index ETF IWC, +0.74% in contrast, gained 8.7% for the month, or more than double the blue chips. And the basket of 11 micro-cap stocks that I presented in my year-ago Trading Strategies column gained an average of 15.3%. (Click here to read my Jan. 4, 2012, column, “How to play the January Effect.”) (To be sure, this 15.3% average return for those 11 micro-cap stocks is exaggerated, since it was calculated by comparing each stock’s closing price at the end of January 2012 with its last sale of 2011. Since all 11 stocks were relatively illiquid and had wide bid/ask spreads, an investor’s actual return would have been somewhat less.) To arrive at this list of stocks a year ago, I turned to the Hulbert Financial Digest’s database of several hundred advisers’ model portfolios. I included just those stocks with a market cap less than $100 million that were recommended for purchase by at least two monitored advisers.

Looking to the second quarter, AK Steel said that it expects improved business conditions, paced by the automotive market, with overall shipments to be higher than for the first quarter as well as better operating rates and lower costs for raw materials.

ACHV,"TEL AVIV (MarketWatch) -- Israeli stocks rose for a third day on Monday, led by strength in Israel Chemicals, Teva Pharmaceutical and the real estate stocks. Two medical-technology firms, affiliated with Teva and the tech-investment manager ProSeed, announced U.S. regulatory developments tied to their efforts. At the close, the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange's benchmark TA-25 Index advanced 0.56% to 1132.43 while the TA-100 Index (1884407) added 0.89% to 1058.24. The Tel-Tech 15 Index of top technology issues moved up 1.80% to 243.60. The Real Estate 15 Index was ahead 1.58% to 285.82. And the Biomed Index gained 0.53% to 1029.45. The most-active issue was fertilizer producer Israel Chemicals, trading up 1.9%. Agrichemicals specialist Makhteshim-Agan MAIXY shares were off 1.1%. Teva TEVA, +0.29% shares edged higher by 0.2% On June 17, reports say, advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration urged the agency to clear Watson Pharmaceuticals, WPI, +0.00% the Corona, Calif., drugmaker, and HRA Pharma of Paris to market a competitor to Teva's Plan B contraceptive. The rival drug is designed to prevent pregnancy if a woman takes it within five days of unprotected sex, compared with three days for Teva's Plan B, the reports say. The Watson-HRA drug would be available by prescription, whereas Teva's drug is available without prescription to women 17 and older and by prescription for younger females, the reports say. In addition, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, OGXI the Bothell, Wash., biopharma company focused on cancer, said on Monday that it began a Phase III trial of custirsen, a potential treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. The trial is the first of three the company plans under a collaboration-and-license agreement with Teva. Teva-Gamida venture And also on Monday, Gamida Cell said that a project within its 50-50 joint venture with Teva received fast-track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Gamida is the Jerusalem drug developer, held 7.66% by Teva, using stem cells to develop technologies and therapies to enable bone-marrow transplants as well as to target diseases of the blood and autoimmune system. It's working with Teva on StemEx, which a website devoted to the drug calls a potential transplantation alternative for children and adults ""with leukemia, lymphoma and other high-risk hematological malignancies who are unable to find a matched, related bone-marrow donor."" The FDA website says the fast-track process is designed to speed the development and expedite the review of drugs to treat serious diseases and fill unmet medical needs. The biotech index was led higher by increases of 4.6% in Hadasit HSITF, +0.52% 3.7% in Lifewave, 3.4% in Evogene, 3.3% in D Medical, and 3% in Brainsway. BiolineRx gave back 9%.

EarlySense technology Off the main index in medical technology, ProSeed shares moved up 3.7%. The publicly traded venture-capital fund holds a stake in EarlySense, the Ramat Gan, Israel, medical-systems developer. EarlySense said on Monday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared for marketing an augmented version of the company's EverOn Touch patient-supervision system. Via sensors under a hospital-bed mattress, the system wirelessly measures patients' vital signs and movements -- including when the patient gets into and leaves bed -- and alerts medical personnel when a patient's condition changes. The FDA has now cleared the company to market the technology with an online display that alerts staff to patients' movement and verifies that nurses have turned patients as required. Avner Halperin, chief executive of EarlySense, told MarketWatch that the system is part of an effort within hospitals to ensure that even patients in general care - not just, for example, in emergency rooms - are monitored continuously. If a patient moves too much, he or she may be in pain or other distress, Halperin said. If the patient does not move enough, that can cause a pressure ulcer, which the company said in a statement is ""the most costly patient-safety risk in US hospitals."" Because the system is wireless, it is comfortable for patients and efficient for nurses, Halperin said.

Overview We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the global development and commercialization of cytisine for smoking cessation. Our focus is to address the global smoking health epidemic, which is a leading cause of preventable death and is responsible for approximately six million deaths annually worldwide. Cytisine is an established 25-day smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by Sopharma AD for over 20 years under the brand name TabexTM. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used cytisine to help treat nicotine addiction, including over 2,000 patients in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. Both trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011 and December 2014, respectively. Cytisine is a naturally occurring, plant-based alkaloid from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides plant. Cytisine is structurally similar to nicotine and has a well-defined, dual-acting mechanism of action that is both agonistic and antagonistic. It is believed to aid in smoking cessation by interacting with nicotine receptors in the brain by reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms through agonistic binding to nicotine receptors and by reducing the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking through antagonistic properties. The cytisine dosing schedule reflects that of an anti-addiction medication, with downward dose titration over a period of 25 days. In late June 2017, we filed our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for cytisine with the FDA, which included NCCIH sponsored non-clinical studies. The IND was accepted in late July 2017. In August 2017, we initiated a study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisine in normal healthy volunteers. We completed the food effect study and announced the results in November of 2017 demonstrating similar bioavailability of cytisine in fed and fasted subjects. In October 2017, we initiated a study assessing the repeat-dose Pharmacokinetics, or PK, and Pharmacodynamics, or PD, effects of 1.5mg and 3mg cytisine in 36 healthy volunteer smokers aged 18-65 years when administered over the standard 25-day course of treatment. Preliminary results on 24 smokers were announced in February 2018. The PK results indicated expected increases in plasma concentration with higher doses of cytisine. Smokers in the study were not required to have a designated or predetermined quit date, however, 58% of the subjects in the trial achieved biochemically verified smoking abstinence by day 26. Half (6/12) of the subjects on the 1.5mg arm and 67% (8/12) of the subjects on the 3.0mg arm achieved abstinence on day 26. Subjects who did not achieve abstinence had a significant reduction in number of daily cigarettes smoked by day 26. The adverse events observed were mostly mild with transient headaches as the most commonly reported event. No serious adverse events were observed in the study. In December 2017, we submitted a meeting request to hold a pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA to review our Phase 3 program and overall development plans for cytisine. We received confirmation from the FDA for a meeting date in the second quarter of 2018. We intend to commence a Phase 3 clinical program in mid-2018, subject to FDA guidance and the availability of capital. In addition to the Phase 3 program, we expect to run additional supportive clinical studies including, but not limited to urine excretion, renal impairment and QT interval prolongation studies as well as supportive New Drug Application, or NDA, non-clinical chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. While third party trials of cytisine have been conducted that may inform future Company-sponsored clinical trials, we have not yet conducted any large scale company-sponsored clinical trials for cytisine in the United States or any other jurisdiction. We previously were developing apatorsen, of which we discontinued further development in August 2017. We provided a notice of discontinuance to our former development partners for apatorsen, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, and a letter of termination to the University of British Columbia, or UBC, notifying them that we have discontinued development of apatorsen resulting in termination of all licensing agreements related to this product candidate. We believe that all financial obligations, other than continuing mutual indemnification obligations and our requirement to pay for out-of-pocket patent expenses incurred up to the date of termination and for abandoning the apatorsen patents and patent applications, under all apatorsen related agreements with Ionis and UBC, are no longer owed and no further payments are due. Our management team has significant experience in growing emerging companies focused on the development of under-utilized pharmaceutical compounds to meet unmet medical needs. We intend to use this experience to develop and ultimately commercialize cytisine either directly or via strategic collaborations. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date. We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses in each year since inception. Our net loss was $10.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, and $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $12.7 million, cash and cash equivalents balance of $5.3 million and a positive working capital balance of $3.7 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred from general and administrative costs associated with our operations and research and development costs from our clinical development programs. Substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain and dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing. We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue our clinical development of, and seek regulatory approval for, cytisine and add personnel necessary to operate as a public company with an advanced clinical candidate. We expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of clinical development programs and efforts to achieve regulatory approval. Without additional funds, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our research and development activities or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations. If any of these events occurs, our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals would be adversely affected. Our current capital resources are insufficient to fund our planned operations for the next 12 months. We will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development activities. Accordingly, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations from the sale of our securities, partnering arrangements or other financing transactions in order to finance the commercialization of our product candidates. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development efforts. Failure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, will have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidate. The accompanying financial results have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. The financial results do not include any adjustments to the amounts and classification of assets and liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern. Such adjustments could be material. Recent Corporate History On August 1, 2017, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or OncoGenex, completed a transaction, or the Arrangement, with Achieve Life Science, Inc., or Achieve, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement between Achieve and OncoGenex dated January 5, 2017, or the Merger Agreement. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, OncoGenex changed its name to Achieve Life Sciences, Inc., instituted an one-for-eleven reverse stock split, issued 8,210,118 shares of its common stock (after accounting for the elimination of resulting fractional shares) in exchange for all of the outstanding preferred shares, common shares and convertible debentures of Achieve, and as a result Achieve became a wholly-owned subsidiary of OncoGenex, and is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the ticker symbol ACHV. More information concerning the Arrangement is contained in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed on August 2, 2017 and our Amendment No. 3 to the Registration Statement on Form S-4/A filed with the SEC on June 6, 2017. These consolidated financial statements account for the Arrangement between OncoGenex and Achieve as a reverse merger, whereby Achieve is deemed to be the acquiring entity from an accounting perspective. Our consolidated results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 include the results of operations of only Achieve for the time period of January 1, 2017 through August 1, 2017 and include the results of the combined company following the completion of the Arrangement on August 1, 2017. The consolidated results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 include only the consolidated results of operations of Achieve and do not include historical results of OncoGenex. This treatment and presentation is in accordance with ASC 805, ""Business Combinations"". Information relating to the number of shares, price per share and per share amounts of common stock are presented on a post- reverse stock split basis, as a reverse stock split in the ratio of one-for-eleven was effected in connection with the Arrangement. In connection with the Arrangement, OncoGenex issued contingent value rights, or CVRs, on July 31, 2017 to their existing stockholders as of July 27, 2017. One CVR was issued for each share of their common stock outstanding as of the record date for such issuance. The CVRs expired on August 17, 2017. A recovery of $0.2 million was recognized on our Consolidated Statements of Loss and Comprehensive Loss. License & Supply Agreements Sopharma License and Supply Agreements We are party to a license agreement, or the Sopharma License Agreement, and a supply agreement, or the Sopharma Supply Agreement, with Sopharma, AD, or Sopharma. Pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement, we were granted access to all available manufacturing, efficacy and safety data related to cytisine, as well as a granted patent in several European countries related to new oral dosage forms of cytisine providing enhanced stability. Additional rights granted under the Sopharma License Agreement include the exclusive use of, and the right to sublicense, the trademark Tabex in all territories described in the Sopharma License Agreement. Under the Sopharma License Agreement, we agreed to pay a nonrefundable license fee. In addition, we agreed to make certain royalty payments equal to a mid-single digit percentage of all net sales of Tabex branded products in our territory during the term of the Sopharma License Agreement, including those sold by a third party pursuant to any sublicense which may be granted by us. To date, we have paid Sopharma $10 pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement. University of Bristol License Agreement In July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Bristol, or the University of Bristol License Agreement. Under the University of Bristol License Agreement, we received exclusive and nonexclusive licenses from the University of Bristol to certain patent and technology rights resulting from research activities into cytisine and its derivatives, including a number of patent applications related to novel approaches to cytisine binding at the nicotinic receptor level. In consideration of rights granted by the University of Bristol, we paid a nominal license fee and agreed to pay amounts of up to $3.2 million, in the aggregate, tied to a financing milestone and to specific clinical development and commercialization milestones resulting from activities covered by the University of Bristol License Agreement. Additionally, if we successfully commercialize product candidates subject to the University of Bristol License Agreement, we are responsible for royalty payments in the low-single digits and payments up to a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions, based upon net sales of such licensed products. On January 22, 2018, we and the University of Bristol entered into an amendment to the University of Bristol License Agreement. Pursuant to the amended University of Bristol License Agreement we received exclusive rights for all human medicinal uses of cytisine across all therapeutic categories from the University of Bristol from research activities into cytisine and its derivatives. In consideration of rights granted by the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, we agreed to pay an initial amount of $37,500 upon the execution of the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, and additional amounts of up to $1.7 million, in the aggregate, tied to a financing milestone and to specific clinical development and commercialization milestones resulting from activities covered by the amended University of Bristol License Agreement, in addition to amounts under the original University of Bristol License Agreement of up to $3.2 million in the aggregate, tied to specific financing, development and commercialization milestones. Additionally, if we successfully commercialize any product candidate subject to the amended University of Bristol License Agreement or to the original University of Bristol License Agreement, we will be responsible, as provided in the original University of Bristol License Agreement, for royalty payments in the low-single digits and payments up to a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions, based upon net sales of such licensed products. To date, we have paid the University of Bristol $50,000 pursuant to the University of Bristol License Agreement. Research and Development Expenses Research and development, or R&D, expenses consist primarily of costs for clinical trials, contract manufacturing, personnel costs, milestone payments to third parties, facilities, regulatory activities, preclinical studies and allocations of other R&D-related costs. External expenses for clinical trials include fees paid to clinical research organizations, clinical trial site costs and patient treatment costs. We manage our clinical trials through contract research organizations and independent medical investigators at our sites and at hospitals and expect this practice to continue. Due to the number of projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects, we do not record or maintain information regarding the indirect operating costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program-specific basis. In addition, we believe that allocating costs on the basis of time incurred by our employees does not accurately reflect the actual costs of a project. We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct our ongoing pre-clinical studies, and initiate new clinical trials and registration-enabling activities. The process of conducting clinical trials and pre-clinical studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and we may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for cytisine. (See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates."") Successful development of cytisine is highly uncertain and may not result in an approved product. We cannot estimate completion dates for development activities or when we might receive material net cash inflows from our R&D projects, if ever. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which markets, and therefore, which regulatory approvals, to pursue and how much funding to direct toward achieving regulatory approval in each market on an ongoing basis in response to our ability to enter into new strategic alliances with respect to each program or potential product candidate, the scientific and clinical success of each future product candidate, and ongoing assessments as to each future product candidate's commercial potential. We will need to raise additional capital and may seek additional strategic alliances in the future in order to advance our various programs. Our projects or intended R&D activities may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate results from completed studies, our R&D priorities and available resources. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative, or G&A, expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in executive, finance and accounting, corporate communications and other administrative functions, as well as consulting costs, including market research, business consulting, human resources and intellectual property. Other costs include professional fees for legal and auditing services, insurance and facility costs. Warrant Liability The following is a summary of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock that are classified as liabilities at December 31, 2017: Total Outstanding Exercise and price per Exercisable Share Expiration Date (1) Series A Warrants issued in July 2014 financing 252,721 44.00 July 2019 (2) Series B Warrants issued in July 2014 financing 60,933 44.00 July 2019  No warrants classified as liabilities were exercised during the years ended December 31, 2017 or 2016. We reassess the fair value of the common stock warrants classified as liabilities at each reporting date utilizing a Black-Scholes pricing model. Inputs used in the pricing model include estimates of stock price volatility, expected warrant life and risk-free interest rate. The computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of comparable companies from a representative peer group selected based on industry and market capitalization. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 Research and Development Expenses Our research and development expenses for our clinical development programs were as follows (in thousands): Year ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 Clinical development programs: Cytisine $ 1,590 $ 286 $ 107 Other research and development 1,511 - - Total research and development expenses $ 3,101 $ 286 $ 107  Research and development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $3.1 million, $0.3 million and $0.1 million, respectively. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to increased research and development activity for our cytisine clinical development program, including the costs associated with filing the IND application, initiating and completing the food effects trial, initiating the repeat dose pharmacokinetics trial and initiating toxicology studies and increased employee expenses and higher facilities costs resulting from the reverse merger of OncoGenex. The increase in research and development expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily related to increased activity in connection with coordinating regulatory and clinical development activities with the FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and the National Institute of Health, or NIH, and non-clinical updates. General and Administrative Expenses G&A expenses for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were $3.5 million, $1.4 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to increase in employee headcount, consulting fees, legal fees and professional fees as a result of the closing of the Arrangement and the integration of OncoGenex with our operations. The increase in general and administrative expenses in 2016 as compared to 2015 was primarily related to the fact that the company was incorporated in May 2015 and did not operate for a full year during the period ended December 31, 2015 Gain / (loss) on warrants We recorded a gain on the revaluation of our outstanding warrants for the year ended December 31, 2017 of $0.1 million, which is included on our consolidated statement of loss as a gain on warrants. We revalue the warrants at each balance sheet date to fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 we did not have any outstanding warrants. Bargain purchase gain In accordance with ASC 805, ""Business Combinations,"" the excess of fair value of acquired net assets over purchase price (negative goodwill) of $1.3 million, was recognized as a gain in the period the Arrangement was completed. We have reassessed whether all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and performed remeasurements to verify that the consideration paid, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed have been properly valued. Contingent value rights recovery The contingent value rights issued by Oncogenex to its shareholders prior to the closing of the Arrangement, expired on August 17, 2017, as we did not enter into any term sheets or agreement with third parties for the development or commercialization of apatorsen. A recovery of $0.2 million was recognized on our Consolidated Statements of Loss and Comprehensive Loss. Loss on disposition of intangible asset and Recovery of deferred income taxes In August 2017, we discontinued further development of apatorsen. We recognized a loss on disposition of apatorsen of $8.6 million and a deferred income tax recovery of $2.9 million as a result of discontinuing the development program and providing a notice of discontinuance of the license agreements with Ionis. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $12.7 million through December 31, 2017, and we expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we operate our business and continue or expand our R&D activities and other operations. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we may not generate product sales revenue in the near future, if ever. As of December 31, 2017, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $5.3 million and a positive working capital balance of $3.7 million. The financial results have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain and dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing. There is no assurance that we will obtain financing from other sources. We have, thus far, financed our operations through the closing of the Arrangement and equity financing. Without additional funds, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our research and development activities or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations. . . .

Arrangement Agreement As discussed in the notes to the financial statements above, during 2017, we completed the Arrangement with OncoGenex. For more information concerning the Arrangement, see the discussion of the Arrangement in Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview We are a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the global development and commercialization of cytisine for smoking cessation. Our focus is to address the global smoking health epidemic, which is the leading cause of preventable death and is responsible for nearly six million deaths annually worldwide. Cytisine is an established 25 day smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by a third party for over 20 years under the brand name TabexTM. As of December 2016, it is estimated that over 21 million people have used cytisine to help combat nicotine addiction, including over 2,000 patients in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. Both trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011 and December 2014, respectively. Cytisine is a naturally occurring, plant-based alkaloid from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides plant. Cytisine is structurally similar to nicotine and has a well-defined, dual-acting mechanism of action that is both agonistic and antagonistic. It is believed to aid in smoking cessation by interacting with nicotine receptors in the brain by reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms through agonistic binding to nicotine receptors and by reducing the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking through antagonistic properties. The cytisine dosing schedule reflects that of an anti-addiction medication, with downward dose titration over a period of 25 days. We have met with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and with other national regulatory authorities in Europe to identify the steps required for the approval of cytisine. The FDA requested results from non-clinical studies, additional human pharmacokinetic studies and adequate demonstration of safety and efficacy from randomized, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 clinical trials. The non-clinical studies requested by the FDA have been sponsored and completed by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, or NCCIH, division of the U.S. National Institutes of Health, in addition to the National Cancer Institute. In July 2017, we filed our Investigational New Drug, or IND, application for cytisine with the FDA, which included NCCIH sponsored non-clinical studies. The IND was accepted in August 2017. In August 2017, we initiated a study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisine in normal healthy volunteers. We have recently completed the food effect study and expect data by the end of 2017. In October 2017, we initiated a study assessing the repeat-dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of cytisine in smokers. We expect data from this repeat-dose study in the first quarter of 2018. We intend to hold a pre-Phase 3 meeting with the FDA in the first quarter of 2018 to review our Phase 3 program and overall development plans for cytisine. We intend to commence a Phase 3 clinical program in mid-2018, subject to FDA guidance and the availability of capital. In addition to the Phase 3 program, we expect to run additional supportive studies including, but not limited to, drug to drug interaction, renal impairment, hepatic impairment, carcinogenicity, and QT interval prolongation. While third party trials of cytisine have been conducted that may inform future Company-sponsored clinical trials, we have not yet conducted any large scale clinical trials for cytisine in the United States or any other jurisdiction. Our management team has significant experience in growing emerging companies focused on in the development of under-utilized pharmaceutical compounds to meet unmet medical needs. We intend to use this experience to develop and ultimately commercialize cytisine either directly or via strategic collaborations. We have no products approved for commercial sale and have not generated any revenue from product sales to date. We have never been profitable and have incurred operating losses in each year since inception. Our net loss was $6.8 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and $0.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. As of September 30, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $8.9 million, cash and cash equivalents balance of $8.0 million and a positive working capital balance of $6.3 million. Substantially all of our operating losses resulted from expenses incurred from general and administrative costs associated with our operations and research and development costs from our clinical development programs. Substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain and dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing from alternative sources. We expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue our clinical development of, and seek regulatory approval for, cytisine and add personnel necessary to operate as a public company with an advanced clinical candidate. In addition, operating as a publicly-traded company may involve the hiring of additional financial and other personnel, upgrading financial information systems, and incurring other costs associated with operating as a public company. We expect that our operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to timing of clinical development programs and efforts to achieve regulatory approval. Without additional funds, the Company may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of its research and development activities or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue its operations. If any of these events occurs, the Company's ability to achieve its development and commercialization goals would be adversely affected. Our current capital resources are insufficient to fund our planned operations for the next 12 months. We will continue to require substantial additional capital to continue our clinical development activities. Accordingly, we will need to raise substantial additional capital to continue to fund our operations, including raising additional financing through our purchase agreement and financing with Lincoln Park Capital and other sourses. The amount and timing of our future funding requirements will depend on many factors, including the pace and results of our clinical development efforts. Failure to raise capital as and when needed, on favorable terms or at all, will have a negative impact on our financial condition and our ability to develop our product candidate. The accompanying financial results have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. License Agreements Sopharma License and Supply Agreements In 2009 and 2010, we entered into a license agreement, or the Sopharma License Agreement, and a supply agreement, or the Sopharma Supply Agreement, with Sopharma, AD, or Sopharma. Pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement, we were granted access to all available manufacturing, efficacy and safety data related to cytisine, as well as a granted patent in several European countries including Germany, France and Italy related to new oral dosage forms of cytisine providing enhanced stability. Additional rights granted under the Sopharma License Agreement include the exclusive use of, and the right to sublicense, the trademark Tabex in all territories-other than certain countries in Central and Eastern Europe, Scandinavia, North Africa, the Middle East and Central Asia, as well as Vietnam, where Sopharma or its affiliates and agents already market Tabex-in connection with the marketing, distribution and sale of products. Under the Sopharma License Agreement, we agreed to pay a nonrefundable license fee. In addition, we agreed to make certain royalty payments equal to a mid-teens percentage of all net sales of Tabex branded products in our territory during the term of the Sopharma License Agreement, including those sold by a third party pursuant to any sublicense which may be granted by us. We have agreed to cooperate with Sopharma in the defense against any actual or threatened infringement claims with respect to Tabex. Sopharma has the right to terminate the Sopharma License Agreement upon the termination or expiration of the Sopharma Supply Agreement. The Sopharma License Agreement will also terminate under customary termination provisions including bankruptcy or insolvency and material breach. To date, we have paid Sopharma $10 pursuant to the Sopharma License Agreement. A cross-license exists between us and Sopharma whereby we grant to Sopharma rights to any patents or patent applications or other intellectual property rights filed by us in Sopharma territories. On May 14, 2015, we and Sopharma entered into an amendment to the Sopharma License Agreement. Among other things, the amendment to the Sopharma License Agreement reduced the royalty payments payable by us to Sopharma from a percentage in the mid-teens to a percentage in the mid-single digits and extended the term of the Sopharma License Agreement until May 26, 2029. On July 28, 2017, we and Sopharma entered into the amended and restated Sopharma Supply Agreement. Pursuant to the amended and restated Sopharma Supply Agreement, we will exclusively purchase all of our cytisine from Sopharma, Sopharma agrees to exclusively supply all such cytisine requested by us, for territories as detailed in the licensing agreement, and we extended the term to 2037. In addition, Achieve will have full access to the cytisine supply chain and Sopharma will manufacture sufficient cytisine to meet a forecast for a specified demand of cytisine for the five years commencing shortly after the commencement of the agreement, with the forecast to be updated regularly thereafter. Each of us and Sopharma may terminate the Sopharma Supply Agreement in the event of the other party's material breach or bankruptcy or insolvency. University of Bristol License Agreement In July 2016, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Bristol, or the University of Bristol License Agreement. Under the University of Bristol License Agreement, we received exclusive and nonexclusive licenses from the University of Bristol to certain patent and technology rights resulting from research activities into cytisine and its derivatives, including a number of patent applications related to novel approaches to cytisine binding at the nicotinic receptor level. Any patents issued in connection with these applications would be scheduled to expire on February 5, 2036 at the earliest. In consideration of rights granted by the University of Bristol, we paid a nominal license fee and agreed to pay amounts of up to $3.2 million, in the aggregate, tied to a financing milestone and to specific clinical development and commercialization milestones resulting from activities covered by the University of Bristol License Agreement. Additionally, if we successfully commercialize product candidates subject to the University of Bristol License Agreement, we are responsible for royalty payments in the low-single digits and payments up to a percentage in the mid-teens of any sublicense income, subject to specified exceptions, based upon net sales of such licensed products. Unless otherwise terminated, the University of Bristol License Agreement will continue until the earlier of July 2036 or the expiration of the last patent claim subject to the University of Bristol License Agreement. We may terminate the University of Bristol License Agreement for convenience upon a specified number of days' prior notice to the University of Bristol. The University of Bristol License Agreement will terminate under customary termination provisions including bankruptcy or insolvency or its material breach of the agreement. Under the terms of the University of Bristol License Agreement, we had provided 100 grams of cytisine to the University of Bristol as an initial contribution. To date, we have not paid any further sums to the University of Bristol pursuant to the University of Bristol License Agreement. Product Candidate Cytisine Our product candidate, cytisine, is a naturally occurring plant-based alkyloid from the seeds of the Laburnum anagyroides plant. Cytisine is a smoking cessation aid believed to interact with nicotine receptors in the brain, reducing the severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms and the reward and satisfaction associated with smoking. Cytisine is an established 25 day smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe by a third party for over 20 years under the brand name TabexTM. As of December 2016, it is estimated that over 21 million people have used cytisine to help combat nicotine addiction, including over 2,000 patients in investigator-conducted, Phase 3 clinical trials in Europe and New Zealand. Both trials were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in September 2011 and December 2014. Product Candidate Apatorsen In August 2017, we discontinued further development of apatorsen. We provided a notice of discontinuance to our former development partners for apatorsen, Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ionis, notifying them that we have discontinued development of apatorsen resulting in termination of the license agreement related to this product candidate. We intend to also terminate the University of British Columbia, or UBC, license agreement related to apatorsen provided that Ionis does not exercise its reversion rights within 90 days of the notice of discontinuance. If Ionis exercises its reversion rights related to apatorsen, we believe Ionis will assume the rights and obligations under the UBC license agreement. We believe that all financial obligations, other than continuing mutual indemnification obligations and our requirement to pay for out-of-pocket patent expenses incurred up to the date of termination and for abandoning the apatorsen patents and patent applications, under all apatorsen related agreements with Ionis and UBC, are no longer owed and no further payments are due. Research and Development Expenses Research and development, or R&D, expenses consist primarily of costs for clinical trials, contract manufacturing, personnel costs, milestone payments to third parties, facilities, regulatory activities, preclinical studies and allocations of other R&D-related costs. External expenses for clinical trials include fees paid to clinical research organizations, clinical trial site costs and patient treatment costs. We manage our clinical trials through contract research organizations and independent medical investigators at our sites and at hospitals and expect this practice to continue. Due to the number of projects and our ability to utilize resources across several projects, we do not record or maintain information regarding the indirect operating costs incurred for our research and development programs on a program-specific basis. In addition, we believe that allocating costs on the basis of time incurred by our employees does not accurately reflect the actual costs of a project. We expect our research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future as we continue to conduct our ongoing pre-clinical studies, and initiate new clinical trials and registration-enabling activities. The process of conducting clinical trials and pre-clinical studies necessary to obtain regulatory approval is costly and time consuming and we may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for cytisine. (See ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to the Development of Our Product Candidates."") Successful development of cytisine is highly uncertain and may not result in an approved product. We cannot estimate completion dates for development activities or when we might receive material net cash inflows from our R&D projects, if ever. We anticipate we will make determinations as to which markets, and therefore, which regulatory approvals, to pursue and how much funding to direct toward achieving regulatory approval in each market on an ongoing basis in response to our ability to enter into new strategic alliances with respect to each program or potential product candidate, the scientific and clinical success of each future product candidate, and ongoing assessments as to each future product candidate's commercial potential. We will need to raise additional capital and may seek additional strategic alliances in the future in order to advance its various programs. Our projects or intended R&D activities may be subject to change from time to time as we evaluate results from completed studies, our R&D priorities and available resources. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative, or G&A, expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for our personnel in executive, finance and accounting, corporate communications and other administrative functions, as well as consulting costs, including market research, business consulting, human resources and intellectual property. Other costs include professional fees for legal and auditing services, insurance and facility costs. Warrant Liability The following is a summary of outstanding warrants to purchase common stock that are classified as liabilities at September 30, 2017: Total Outstanding Exercise and price per Exercisable Share Expiration Date (1) Series A Warrants issued in July 2014 financing 252,721 44.000 July 2019 (2) Series B Warrants issued in July 2014 financing 60,933 44.000 July 2019  No warrants were exercised during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 or 2016. We reassess the fair value of the common stock warrants classified as liabilities at each reporting date utilizing a Black-Scholes pricing model. Inputs used in the pricing model include estimates of stock price volatility, expected warrant life and risk-free interest rate. The computation of expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of shares of our common stock for a period that coincides with the expected life of the warrants. Results of Operations For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 Research and development expenses Our research and development expenses for our clinical development program for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 are as follows (in thousands):  Three months ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 Clinical development programs: Cytisine $ 203 $ 69 $ 326 $ 206 Other research and development $ 622 $ - $ 622 $ - Total research and development expenses $ 825 $ 69 $ 948 $ 206  Research and development expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 increased to $0.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, from $0.1 million and $0.2 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to increased employee expenses and higher facilities costs resulting from the reverse merger of OncoGenex and increased research and development activity for our cytisine clinical development program, including the costs associated with filing the IND application and initiating the food effects trial. General and administrative expenses General and administrative expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 increased to $1.6 million and $1.9 million, respectively, from $0.3 million and $0.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The increase in 2017 as compared to 2016 was due to increase in employee headcount, consulting fees, legal fees and professional fees as a result of the closing of the Arrangement and the integration of OncoGenex with our operations. Gain / (loss) on warrants We recorded a gain of $0.1 million and $0.1 million on the revaluation of our outstanding warrants for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Bargain purchase gain In accordance with ASC 805, ""Business Combinations,"" the excess of fair value of acquired net assets over purchase price (negative goodwill) of $1.3 million, was recognized as a gain in the period the Arrangement was completed. We have reassessed whether all acquired assets and assumed liabilities have been identified and recognized and performed remeasurements to verify that the consideration paid, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed have been properly valued. (See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) Contingent value rights recovery The contingent value rights issued by Oncogenex to its shareholders prior to the closing of the Arrangement, expired on August 17, 2017, as we did not enter into any term sheets or agreement with third parties for the development or commercialization of apatorsen. A recovery of $0.2 million was recognized on our Consolidated Statements of Loss and Comprehensive Loss. (See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) Loss on disposition of intangible asset and Recovery of deferred income taxes In August 2017, we discontinued further development of apatorsen. We recognized a loss on disposition of apatorsen of $8.6 million and a deferred income tax recovery of $2.9 million as a result of discontinuing the development program and providing a notice of discontinuance of the license agreements with Ionis. (See Note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) Liquidity and Capital Resources We have incurred an accumulated deficit of $8.9 million through September 30, 2017, and we expect to incur substantial additional losses in the future as we operate our business and continue or expand our R&D activities and other operations. We have not generated any revenue from product sales to date, and we may not generate product sales revenue in the near future, if ever. The financial results have been prepared assuming we will continue to operate as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business. Substantial doubt exists as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is uncertain and dependent on our ability to obtain additional financing from alternative sources. There is no assurance that we will obtain financing from other sources. We have, thus far, financed our operations through the closing of the Arrangement (See Note 2 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q) and equity financing (See Note 8 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q). Without additional funds, the Company may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of its research and development activities or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue its operations.

Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company that has been focused on the development of novel next generation cancer therapeutics. Our mission is to accelerate transformative therapies to improve the lives of people living with cancer and other serious diseases. Our product candidate apatorsen has a distinct mechanism of action and represents a unique opportunity for cancer drug development that we believe has the potential to improve treatment outcomes in a variety of cancers. Apatorsen is designed to block the production of heat shock protein 27, or Hsp27, a protein that promotes treatment resistance in cancer. In some clinical trials evaluating apatorsen, high serum Hsp27 levels appear to be a strong prognostic indicator for shorter survival outcomes. We currently do not intend to conduct additional pre-clinical or clinical studies with apatorsen and are seeking a collaboration partnership to fund and further develop this product candidate. As a result of custirsen not meeting the primary endpoint of improving overall survival in three completed phase 3 trials, we have discontinued further development of custirsen. In November 2016, we provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), or Ionis, and a letter of termination to the University of British Columbia, or UBC, notifying those parties that we have discontinued development of custirsen, resulting in termination of all licensing agreements related to custirsen. All custirsen clinical studies have been completed and all global regulatory agencies notified of trial closures. All investigational new drug applications, or INDs, with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, related to custirsen, have been withdrawn. In January 2017, we also discontinued further development of our pre-clinical product candidate, OGX-225. We provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis, and a letter of termination to UBC, informing them that we have discontinued development of OGX-225 resulting in termination of the license agreement related to this product candidate. We believe that all financial obligations, other than continuing mutual indemnification obligations and our requirement to pay for out-of-pocket patent expenses incurred up to the date of termination and for abandoning the OGX-225 patents and patent applications, under all OGX-225-related agreements with Ionis and UBC, are no longer owed and no further payments are due. On January 5, 2017, we and Achieve Life Science, Inc, or Achieve, a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, under which OncoGenex will acquire Achieve in an all-stock transaction. Upon completion of the Merger Agreement, Achieve's stockholders are expected to own 75% of the combined company's outstanding shares and our current equityholders are expected to own the remaining 25% of the combined company's outstanding shares. Following completion of the merger, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will be renamed Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. Pending Merger Agreement with Achieve On January 5, 2017, we and Achieve entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Ash Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours will merge with and into Achieve, or the First Merger, with Achieve becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and the surviving company of the First Merger, or the Initial Surviving Corporation. Promptly following the First Merger, the Initial Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Ash Acquisition Sub 2, Inc., or Merger Sub 2, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, with Merger Sub 2 continuing as the surviving entity as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ours. The two mergers taken together, are intended to qualify as a ""reorganization"" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The surviving company is expected to be renamed Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. and is referred to herein as the ""combined company."" The Special Meeting date to vote on the merger has been set for August 1, 2017. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the First Merger, each outstanding share of Achieve common stock will be converted into the right to receive approximately 4,242.8904 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement based on increases or decreases in Achieve's fully-diluted capitalization, as well as the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. Immediately following the effective time of the merger, our equityholders are expected to own approximately 25% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, and the Achieve stockholders are expected to own approximately 75% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. Consummation of the merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by the stockholders of us and Achieve. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Achieve, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $0.5 million. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that if either party breaches certain covenants regarding alternative transactions to those contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the breaching party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $1.0 million. In connection with certain terminations of the Merger Agreement, either party may be required to pay the other party's third party expenses up to $0.5 million. At the effective time of the First Merger, our Board of Directors is expected to consist of seven members, three of whom will be designated by us and four of whom will be designated by Achieve. We are expected to designate Scott Cormack, Stewart Parker and Martin Mattingly. Achieve is expected to designate Richard Stewart, Anthony Clarke, Donald Joseph and Jay Moyes. Additionally, at the effective time of the First Merger, Rick Stewart, the current Chairman of Achieve, is expected to be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company; Anthony Clarke, the current Chief Scientific Officer of Achieve, is expected to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the combined company; and John Bencich, our Chief Financial Officer and Cindy Jacobs, our Chief Medical Officer, are expected to continue to serve the combined company in their respective roles. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) certain of our officers and directors, who collectively hold approximately 1.2 percent of the outstanding shares of our capital stock as of the close of business on January 4, 2017, have each entered into a support agreement with Achieve, or the OncoGenex Support Agreements, and (ii) certain officers, directors and stockholders of Achieve, who collectively hold approximately 78 percent of the outstanding shares of Achieve capital stock as of the close of business on January 4, 2017, have each entered into a support agreement with us, or the Achieve Support Agreements, and together with the OncoGenex Support Agreements, the Support Agreements. The Support Agreements include covenants as to the voting of such shares in favor of approving the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and against actions that could adversely affect the consummation of the Merger. The Support Agreements will terminate upon the earlier of the consummation of the First Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement by its terms. Concurrently and in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, We expect to issue contingent value rights, or each, a CVR and collectively, the CVRs, on July 31, 2017 to our existing stockholders as of July 27, 2017. One CVR will be issued for each share of our common stock outstanding as of the record date for such issuance. Each CVR will be a non-transferable right to potentially receive certain cash, equity or other consideration received by the combined company in the event the combined company receives any such consideration during the five-year period after consummation of the First Merger as a result of the achievement of certain clinical milestones, regulatory milestones, sales-based milestones and/or up-front payment milestones relating to our product candidate apatorsen, or the Milestones, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a contingent value rights agreement to be entered into between us, Achieve and an as of yet unidentified third party, as rights agent, or the CVR Agreement. The aggregate consideration to be distributed to the holders of the CVRs, if any, will be equal to 80% of the consideration received by the combined company as a result of the achievement of the Milestones less certain agreed to offsets, as determined pursuant to the CVR Agreement. Under the CVR Agreement, for a period of six months beginning in February 2017, we will use certain defined efforts to enter into an agreement with a third party regarding the development and/or commercialization of apatorsen. At the expiration of this six-month period, if a third party has not entered into a term sheet for the development or commercialization of apatorsen, the combined company will no longer be contractually required to pursue an agreement regarding apatorsen and no consideration will be payable to the holders of CVRs. We are currently undertaking efforts to identify a third party to develop and, if approved, commercialize apatorsen, but have not yet identified such a party or set any Milestones. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to identify and enter into an agreement with a third party to develop and potentially commercialize apatorsen by August 17, 2017, or if we do, that any Milestones will be set or any consideration will ever be received by the post-merger combined company or distributed to the CVR holders. Therefore, our stockholders will not be able to determine the value of the CVRs, if any, at the time they are asked to approve the merger, since the value of the CVRs is contingent upon the occurrence of future events that are not yet known. We also entered into a letter agreement with Achieve, whereby we would pay, on behalf of Achieve, for transaction and other costs associated with the merger. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated and as a result of such termination we are required to pay to Achieve one or more termination fees, the total amount of termination fees we would owe is reduced by the amount of the transaction and other costs we would have paid on behalf of Achieve. As of June 30, 2017, we have paid, on behalf of Achieve, a total of $0.4 million in transaction and other costs associated with the merger. Product Candidate Apatorsen Apatorsen is our product candidate that is designed to inhibit production of Hsp27, a cell-survival protein expressed in many types of cancers including bladder, prostate, breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. Hsp27 expression is stress-induced, including by many anti-cancer therapies. Overexpression of Hsp27 is thought to be an important factor leading to the development of treatment resistance and is associated with metastasis and negative clinical outcomes in patients with various tumor types. In some clinical trials evaluating apatorsen, high serum Hsp27 levels at baseline, or at the start of treatment, appear to be a strong prognostic indicator for shorter survival outcomes. Apatorsen utilizes second-generation antisense drug chemistry and belongs to the drug class known as antisense therapeutics. We have collaborated with Ionis and selectively licensed technology from Ionis to combine Ionis' second-generation antisense chemistry with our proprietary gene target sequences to create an inhibitor that is designed to down-regulate Hsp27. In contrast to first-generation antisense chemistry, second-generation antisense chemistry has improved target binding affinity, increased resistance to degradation and improved tissue distribution. These improvements result in slower clearance of the therapies from the body, which allow for less frequent dosing and thereby make treatment easier on patients at a lower associated cost. A number of preclinical studies have shown that reducing Hsp27 production induces tumor cell death in prostate, non-small cell lung, bladder and pancreatic cancer cells. The studies also suggest that reducing Hsp27 production sensitizes prostate tumor cells to hormone ablation therapy. These preclinical studies have also shown that inhibiting the production of Hsp27 in human prostate, bladder, lung, breast, ovarian and pancreatic tumor cells sensitizes the cells to chemotherapy. Hsp27 has been reported by others to function as an immunomodulatory protein by a number of mechanisms that include altering important membrane-expressed proteins on monocytes and immature dendritic cells; this alteration results in tumor-associated immune cells that are not functional in identifying and killing cancer cells. The induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines by Hsp27 may also play a role in down-regulating lymphocyte activation leading to additional unresponsive immune cells. In 2013, we initiated the ORCA (Ongoing Studies Evaluating Treatment Resistance in CAncer) program which encompasses six phase 2 clinical studies designed to evaluate whether treatment with apatorsen can lead to improved prognosis and treatment outcomes for cancer patients. All six of these trials have been completed. We currently do not intend to conduct additional pre-clinical or clinical studies with apatorsen and are seeking a collaboration partnership to fund and further develop this product candidate. The six phase 2 apatorsen clinical trials that have been completed under the ORCA program are described below. Completed Trials The Borealis-2(TM) Trial: The completed investigator-sponsored, randomized phase 2 trial evaluated apatorsen in combination with docetaxel treatment compared to docetaxel treatment alone in patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer who have disease progression following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint analysis was a superiority test for overall survival, performed at a one-sided 0.10 significance level using a stratified log-rank test. Secondary endpoints included PFS, disease response and safety assessments. The trial met its primary endpoint of improving survival at the one-sided 0.10 significance level. Patients who received apatorsen treatment experienced a 20% reduction in risk of death, compared to patients receiving docetaxel alone (overall survival hazard ratio (HR)=0.80; 80% CI: 0.65-0.98; p=0.078). In February 2017, results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. Apatorsen was well tolerated in combination with docetaxel. The reduction in risk of progression or death was 20% for patients receiving apatorsen in combination with docetaxel, compared to docetaxel alone (PFS HR= 0.80; 80% CI: 0.64-1.01; p=0.107). Partial or complete responses occurred in 16.2% patients receiving apatorsen plus docetaxel compared to 10.9% patients receiving docetaxel alone with median response durations of 6.2 months versus 4.4 months, respectively. Overall for the study, higher baseline serum Hsp27 levels were significantly prognostic for indicating an almost 2-fold higher risk of death (HR= 1.96; p=0.0001). In an exploratory analysis on a subset of patients (20% of total) who completed at least 2 treatment cycles and had either a decrease in serum Hsp27 levels from baseline or had only a 20.5% increase in serum Hsp27 levels from baseline, the reduction in risk of death with apatorsen treatment was 71% (HR= 0.29: The Borealis-1(TM) Trial: Our completed company-sponsored Borealis-1(TM) phase 2 trial was a three-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating 600mg or 1000mg apatorsen in combination with a first-line standard of care chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine and cisplatin) in the metastatic setting. Overall, trial results indicated that the addition of 600mg apatorsen to standard of care chemotherapy showed a 14% reduction in risk of death (HR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.54-1.36; p=0.252) when compared to chemotherapy alone. Subsequent exploratory analyses showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared to placebo (HR=0.72; 95% CI: The Spruce(TM) Trial: The investigator-sponsored, randomized, placebo-controlled phase 2 trial evaluating apatorsen plus carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy compared to carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy in patients with previously untreated advanced non-squamous NSCLC. Patients continued pemetrexed with weekly apatorsen or placebo infusions as maintenance treatment until disease progression if they completed a minimum of 3 cycles of chemotherapy treatment. The aim of the trial is to determine if adding apatorsen to carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy could extend PFS outcome. In January 2016, the primary endpoint data for PFS was reported to have not reached the statistical significance required to demonstrate a benefit (PFS HR= 0.90; 80% CI 0.71-1.14; p=0.557). In the study, higher baseline serum Hsp27 levels were found to be significantly prognostic for indicating an almost 2-fold higher risk of death (HR= 1.98; p=0.0034). A potential benefit was observed in a subgroup of patients with high baseline serum Hsp27 status (~10% of total) when treated with apatorsen (PFS HR= 0.462; 80% CI: 0.193- 1.106). Study follow up with survival results was completed at the end of 2016. The addition of apatorsen to carboplatin and pemetrexed therapy did not demonstrate an overall survival benefit in the study (HR= 1.067; 80% CI: 0.838-1.359). PFS results were presented at ASCO 2016. The study investigators concluded that apatorsen and pemetrexed/carboplatin therapy was well tolerated and showed promising PFS results in the treatment of patients with non-squamous NSCLC who have high baseline Hsp27 status and thus warranted further study in this population. We do not intend to pursue additional trials in non-squamous NSCLC at this time. The study was an investigator-sponsored trial conducted by sites under the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. The Rainier(TM) Trial: Our completed investigator-sponsored Rainier(TM) phase 2 trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating apatorsen in combination with ABRAXANE(R) (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound) and gemcitabine compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone in patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. The addition of apatorsen to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine did not show improved survival for patients receiving apatorsen plus ABRAXANE and gemcitabine when compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone (HR= 1.098; 95% CI 0.759-1.590). Similarly there was no improvement in PFS (PFS HR=1.020; 95% CI 0.806-1.290). The study did show that higher baseline serum Hsp27 levels were significantly prognostic for indicating a 1.8-fold higher risk of death (HR= 1.84; p=0.0041). A potential benefit was observed in a subgroup of patients with high baseline serum Hsp27 status (14% of total) when treated with apatorsen (PFS HR= 0.381; 95% CI 0.120-1.208 and survival HR= 0.587; 95% CI 0.195-1.770). The study was presented at the Gastrointestinal, or GI, Cancers Symposium meeting in January 2016. The study investigators concluded that these promising results in pancreatic cancer patients with high baseline Hsp27 status warrant further study of apatorsen in this population. We do not intend to pursue additional trials in pancreatic cancer at this time. The study was an investigator-sponsored trial conducted by sites under the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. The Pacific(TM) Trial: The investigator-sponsored, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating apatorsen in men with CRPC who are experiencing a rising PSA while receiving Zytiga(R) (abiraterone acetate). The aim of the trial was to evaluate if adding apatorsen to Zytiga treatment can reverse or delay treatment resistance by evaluating the PFS rate at a milestone Day 60 assessment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were progression free (clinical and radiologic) at study day 60. Other secondary endpoints were PSA and objective responses, time to disease progression, circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, and Hsp27 levels. The Pacific trial was an investigator-sponsored trial conducted by the Hoosier Cancer Research Network at sites in Canada and the United State. In February 2017, results were presented at the ASCO 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. Apatorsen was well tolerated in combination with Zytiga with the median treatment duration of 106 days for apatorsen plus Zytiga compared to 75 days for continuing Zytiga alone. The proportion of patients who were progression free at Day 60 was 33% when apatorsen was added to Zytiga, compared to 17% with Zytiga alone (p=0.17). The median time of PFS was 8.6 weeks for apatorsen treatment, compared to 7.9 weeks for Zytiga. A 50% or greater decline in PSA levels was seen in 6% of patients when apatorsen was added to Zytiga compared to 3% with continuing Zytiga alone. Stable disease or partial response was seen in 20% of . . . Jul 31, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company that has been focused on the development of novel next generation cancer therapeutics. Our mission is to accelerate transformative therapies to improve the lives of people living with cancer and other serious diseases. Our product candidate apatorsen has a distinct mechanism of action and represents a unique opportunity for cancer drug development that we believe has the potential to improve treatment outcomes in a variety of cancers. Apatorsen is designed to block the production of heat shock protein 27, or Hsp27, a protein that promotes treatment resistance in cancer. In some clinical trials evaluating apatorsen, high serum Hsp27 levels appear to be a strong prognostic indicator for shorter survival outcomes. We currently do not intend to conduct additional pre-clinical or clinical studies with apatorsen and are seeking a collaboration partnership to fund and further develop this product candidate. As a result of custirsen not meeting the primary endpoint of improving overall survival in three completed phase 3 trials, we have discontinued further development of custirsen. In November 2016, we provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (formerly Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.), or Ionis, and a letter of termination to the University of British Columbia, or UBC, notifying those parties that we have discontinued development of custirsen, resulting in termination of all licensing agreements related to custirsen. All custirsen clinical studies have been completed and all global regulatory agencies notified of trial closures. All investigational new drug applications, or INDs, with the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, related to custirsen, have been withdrawn. In January 2017, we also discontinued further development of our pre-clinical product candidate, OGX-225. We provided a notice of discontinuance to Ionis, and a letter of termination to UBC, informing them that we have discontinued development of OGX-225 resulting in termination of the license agreement related to this product candidate. We believe that all financial obligations, other than continuing mutual indemnification obligations and our requirement to pay for out-of-pocket patent expenses incurred up to the date of termination and for abandoning the OGX-225 patents and patent applications, under all OGX-225-related agreements with Ionis and UBC, are no longer owed and no further payments are due . On January 5, 2017, we and Achieve Life Science, Inc, or Achieve, a privately held specialty pharmaceutical company, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization, or the Merger Agreement, under which OncoGenex will acquire Achieve in an all-stock transaction. Upon completion of the Merger Agreement, Achieve's stockholders are expected to own 75% of the combined company's outstanding shares and our current equityholders are expected to own the remaining 25% of the combined company's outstanding shares. Following completion of the merger, OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. will be renamed Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. Pending Merger Agreement with Achieve On January 5, 2017, we and Achieve entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which Ash Acquisition Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours will merge with and into Achieve, or the First Merger, with Achieve becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of ours and the surviving company of the First Merger, or the Initial Surviving Corporation. Promptly following the First Merger, the Initial Surviving Corporation will merge with and into Ash Acquisition Sub 2, Inc., or Merger Sub 2, a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, with Merger Sub 2 continuing as the surviving entity as a direct wholly owned subsidiary of ours. The two mergers taken together, are intended to qualify as a ""reorganization"" within the meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The surviving company is expected to be renamed Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. and is referred to herein as the ""combined company."" The Merger is expected to close mid-2017. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the First Merger, each outstanding share of Achieve common stock will be converted into the right to receive approximately 4,242.8904 shares of our common stock, subject to adjustment as provided in the Merger Agreement based on increases or decreases in Achieve's fully-diluted capitalization, as well as the payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares. Immediately following the effective time of the merger, our equityholders are expected to own approximately 25% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully diluted basis, and the Achieve stockholders are expected to own approximately 75% of the outstanding capital stock of the combined company on a fully diluted basis. Consummation of the merger is subject to certain closing conditions, including, among other things, approval by the stockholders of us and Achieve. The Merger Agreement contains certain termination rights for both us and Achieve, and further provides that, upon termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, either party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $0.5 million. In addition, the Merger Agreement provides that if either party breaches certain covenants regarding alternative transactions to those contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the breaching party may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $1.0 million. In connection with certain terminations of the Merger Agreement, either party may be required to pay the other party's third party expenses up to $0.5 million. At the effective time of the First Merger, our Board of Directors is expected to consist of seven members, three of whom will be designated by us and four of whom will be designated by Achieve. We are expected to designate Scott Cormack, Stewart Parker and Martin Mattingly. Achieve is expected to designate Richard Stewart, Anthony Clark and two other independent directors that have yet to be determined. Additionally, at the effective time of the First Merger, Rick Stewart, the current Chairman of Achieve, is expected to be the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the combined company; Anthony Clarke, the current Chief Scientific Officer of Achieve, is expected to be the Chief Scientific Officer of the combined company; and John Bencich, our Chief Financial Officer and Cindy Jacobs, our Chief Medical Officer, are expected to continue to serve the combined company in their respective roles. In accordance with the terms of the Merger Agreement, (i) certain of our officers and directors, who collectively hold approximately 1.2 percent of the outstanding shares of our capital stock as of the close of business on January 4, 2017, have each entered into a support agreement with Achieve, or the OncoGenex Support Agreements, and (ii) certain officers, directors and stockholders of Achieve, who collectively hold approximately 78 percent of the outstanding shares of Achieve capital stock as of the close of business on January 4, 2017, have each entered into a support agreement with us, or the Achieve Support Agreements, and together with the OncoGenex Support Agreements, the Support Agreements. The Support Agreements include covenants as to the voting of such shares in favor of approving the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement and against actions that could adversely affect the consummation of the Merger. The Support Agreements will terminate upon the earlier of the consummation of the First Merger or the termination of the Merger Agreement by its terms. Concurrently and in connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, We expect to issue contingent value rights, or each, a CVR and collectively, the CVRs, to our existing stockholders prior to the completion of the First Merger. One CVR will be issued for each share of our common stock outstanding as of the record date for such issuance. Each CVR will be a non-transferable right to potentially receive certain cash, equity or other consideration received by the combined company in the event the combined company receives any such consideration during the five-year period after consummation of the First Merger as a result of the achievement of certain clinical milestones, regulatory milestones, sales-based milestones and/or up-front payment milestones relating to our product candidate apatorsen, or the Milestones, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in a contingent value rights agreement to be entered into between us, Achieve and an as of yet unidentified third party, as rights agent, or the CVR Agreement. The aggregate consideration to be distributed to the holders of the CVRs, if any, will be equal to 80% of the consideration received by the combined company as a result of the achievement of the Milestones less certain agreed to offsets, as determined pursuant to the CVR Agreement. Under the CVR Agreement, for a period of six months beginning in February 2017, we will use certain defined efforts to enter into an agreement with a third party regarding the development and/or commercialization of apatorsen. At the expiration of this six-month period, if a third party has not entered into a term sheet for the development or commercialization of apatorsen, the combined company will no longer be contractually required to pursue an agreement regarding apatorsen and no consideration will be payable to the holders of CVRs. We are currently undertaking efforts to identify a third party to develop and, if approved, commercialize apatorsen, but have not yet identified such a party or set any Milestones. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to identify and enter into an agreement with a third party to develop and potentially commercialize apatorsen by August 17, 2017, or if we do, that any Milestones will be set or any consideration will ever be received by the post-merger combined company or distributed to the CVR holders. Therefore, our stockholders will not be able to determine the value of the CVRs, if any, at the time they are asked to approve the merger, since the value of the CVRs is contingent upon the occurrence of future events that are not yet known. We also entered into a letter agreement with Achieve, whereby we would pay, on behalf of Achieve, for transactions costs associated with the merger. In the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated and as a result of such termination we are required to pay to Achieve one or more termination fees, the total amount of termination fees we would owe is reduced by the amount of the transaction costs we would have paid on behalf of Achieve. As of March 31, 2017, we have paid, on behalf of Achieve, a total of $0.2 million in transaction costs associated with the merger. Product Candidate Apatorsen Apatorsen is our product candidate that is designed to inhibit production of Hsp27, a cell-survival protein expressed in many types of cancers including bladder, prostate, breast, pancreatic and non-small cell lung cancer. Hsp27 expression is stress-induced, including by many anti-cancer therapies. Overexpression of Hsp27 is thought to be an important factor leading to the development of treatment resistance and is associated with metastasis and negative clinical outcomes in patients with various tumor types. In some clinical trials evaluating apatorsen, high serum Hsp27 levels at baseline, or at the start of treatment, appear to be a strong prognostic indicator for shorter survival outcomes. Apatorsen utilizes second-generation antisense drug chemistry and belongs to the drug class known as antisense therapeutics. We have collaborated with Ionis and selectively licensed technology from Ionis to combine Ionis' second-generation antisense chemistry with our proprietary gene target sequences to create an inhibitor that is designed to down-regulate Hsp27. In contrast to first-generation antisense chemistry, second-generation antisense chemistry has improved target binding affinity, increased resistance to degradation and improved tissue distribution. These improvements result in slower clearance of the therapies from the body, which allow for less frequent dosing and thereby make treatment easier on patients at a lower associated cost. A number of preclinical studies have shown that reducing Hsp27 production induces tumor cell death in prostate, non-small cell lung, bladder and pancreatic cancer cells. The studies also suggest that reducing Hsp27 production sensitizes prostate tumor cells to hormone ablation therapy. These preclinical studies have also shown that inhibiting the production of Hsp27 in human prostate, bladder, lung, breast, ovarian and pancreatic tumor cells sensitizes the cells to chemotherapy. Hsp27 has been reported by others to function as an immunomodulatory protein by a number of mechanisms that include altering important membrane-expressed proteins on monocytes and immature dendritic cells; this alteration results in tumor-associated immune cells that are not functional in identifying and killing cancer cells. The induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines by Hsp27 may also play a role in down-regulating lymphocyte activation leading to additional unresponsive immune cells. In 2013, we initiated the ORCA (Ongoing Studies Evaluating Treatment Resistance in CAncer) program which encompasses six phase 2 clinical studies designed to evaluate whether treatment with apatorsen can lead to improved prognosis and treatment outcomes for cancer patients. Five of these trials have been completed and the remaining ongoing trial completed enrollment in December 2016 with results expected in the second half of 2017. We currently do not intend to conduct additional pre-clinical or clinical studies with apatorsen and are seeking a collaboration partnership to fund and further develop this product candidate. Six phase 2 apatorsen clinical trials have been initiated or completed under the ORCA program. Ongoing Trial The Spruce-2(TM) Trial (formerly referred to as the Cedar Trial): The investigator-sponsored, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating apatorsen plus gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy or gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy alone in patients with previously untreated advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC. Patients also continue weekly apatorsen infusions as maintenance treatment after chemotherapy until disease progression. The aim of the trial is to determine if adding apatorsen to gemcitabine and carboplatin therapy can extend progression free survival, or PFS, outcome. Additional analyses will include tumor response rates, overall survival, safety, and health-related quality of life, as well as to determine the effect of Hsp27 levels on clinical outcomes, explore potential biomarkers that may help predict response to treatment and survival outcomes in patients who were at increased risk for poor outcomes. The trial was initiated in July 2014 and completed enrollment in December 2016. During the conduct of the trial, two amendments were submitted: one that reduced the apatorsen dose to 400mg and the second that reduced patient enrollment to ~90 patients. The trial completed patient enrollment in December 2016 and results are expected in the second half of 2017. The trial is an investigator-sponsored trial being conducted and funded primarily by the UK National Cancer Research Network and the UK Experimental Cancer Medicine Network. Completed Trials The Borealis-2(TM) Trial: The completed investigator-sponsored, randomized phase 2 trial evaluated apatorsen in combination with docetaxel treatment compared to docetaxel treatment alone in patients with advanced or metastatic bladder cancer who have disease progression following first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint analysis was a superiority test for overall survival, performed at a one-sided 0.10 significance level using a stratified log-rank test. Secondary endpoints included PFS, disease response and safety assessments. The trial met its primary endpoint of improving survival at the one-sided 0.10 significance level. Patients who received apatorsen treatment experienced a 20% reduction in risk of death, compared to patients receiving docetaxel alone (overall survival hazard ratio (HR)=0.80; 80% CI: 0.65-0.98; p=0.078). In February 2017, results were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology, or ASCO, 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. Apatorsen was well tolerated in combination with docetaxel. The reduction in risk of progression or death was 20% for patients receiving apatorsen in combination with docetaxel, compared to docetaxel alone (PFS HR= 0.80; 80% CI: 0.64-1.01; p=0.107). Partial or complete responses occurred in 16.2% patients receiving apatorsen plus docetaxel compared to 10.9% patients receiving docetaxel alone with median response durations of 6.2 months versus 4.4 months, respectively. Overall for the study, higher baseline serum Hsp27 levels were significantly prognostic for indicating an almost 2-fold higher risk of death (HR= 1.96; p=0.0001). In an exploratory analysis on a subset of patients (20% of total) who completed at least 2 treatment cycles and had either a decrease in serum Hsp27 levels from baseline or had only a 20.5% increase in serum Hsp27 levels from baseline, the reduction in risk of death with apatorsen treatment was 71% (HR= 0.29: The Borealis-1(TM) Trial: Our completed company-sponsored Borealis-1(TM) phase 2 trial was a three-arm, randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating 600mg or 1000mg apatorsen in combination with a first-line standard of care chemotherapy regimen (gemcitabine and cisplatin) in the metastatic setting. Overall, trial results indicated that the addition of 600mg apatorsen to standard of care chemotherapy showed a 14% reduction in risk of death (HR = 0.86; 95% CI: 0.54-1.36; p=0.252) when compared to chemotherapy alone. Subsequent exploratory analyses showed a trend for improved survival in patients with baseline poor prognostic features treated with 600 mg apatorsen compared to placebo (HR=0.72; 95% CI: The Rainier(TM) Trial: Our completed investigator-sponsored Rainier(TM) phase 2 trial was a randomized, placebo-controlled trial evaluating apatorsen in combination with ABRAXANE(R) (paclitaxel protein-bound particles for injectable suspension) (albumin-bound) and gemcitabine compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone in patients with untreated metastatic pancreatic cancer. The addition of apatorsen to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine did not show improved survival for patients receiving apatorsen plus ABRAXANE and gemcitabine when compared to ABRAXANE and gemcitabine alone (HR= 1.098; 95% CI 0.759-1.590). Similarly there was no improvement in PFS (PFS HR=1.020; 95% CI 0.806-1.290). The study did show that higher baseline serum Hsp27 levels were significantly prognostic for indicating a 1.8-fold higher risk of death (HR= 1.84; p=0.0041). A potential benefit was observed in a subgroup of patients with high baseline serum Hsp27 status (14% of total) when treated with apatorsen (PFS HR= 0.381; 95% CI 0.120-1.208 and survival HR= 0.587; 95% CI 0.195-1.770). The study was presented at the Gastrointestinal, or GI, Cancers Symposium meeting in January 2016. The study investigators concluded that these promising results in pancreatic cancer patients with high baseline Hsp27 status warrant further study of apatorsen in this population. We do not intend to pursue additional trials in pancreatic cancer at this time. The study was an investigator-sponsored trial conducted by sites under the Sarah Cannon Research Institute. The Pacific(TM) Trial: The investigator-sponsored, randomized phase 2 trial evaluating apatorsen in men with CRPC who are experiencing a rising PSA while receiving Zytiga(R) (abiraterone acetate). The aim of the trial was to evaluate if adding apatorsen to Zytiga treatment can reverse or delay treatment resistance by evaluating the PFS rate at a milestone Day 60 assessment. The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients who were progression free (clinical and radiologic) at study day 60. Other secondary endpoints were PSA and objective responses, time to disease progression, circulating tumor cells, or CTCs, and Hsp27 levels. The Pacific trial was an investigator-sponsored trial conducted by the Hoosier Cancer Research Network at sites in Canada and the United State. In February 2017, results were presented at the ASCO 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium. Apatorsen was well tolerated in combination with Zytiga with the median treatment duration of 106 days for apatorsen plus Zytiga compared to 75 days for continuing Zytiga alone. The proportion of patients who were progression free at Day 60 was 33% when apatorsen was added to Zytiga, compared to 17% with Zytiga alone (p=0.17). The median time of PFS was 8.6 weeks for apatorsen treatment, compared to 7.9 weeks for Zytiga. A 50% or greater decline in PSA levels was seen in 6% of patients when apatorsen was added to Zytiga compared to 3% with continuing Zytiga alone. Stable disease or partial response was seen in 20% of patients when apatorsen was added to Zytiga vs 14% with Zytiga alone. For . . . May 15, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

ACHV,"BOTHELL, Wash. and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, March 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. ACHV, -1.17% a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the global development and commercialization of cytisine for smoking cessation, today highlighted recent accomplishments and announced fourth quarter and year-end 2017 financial results. Recent Highlights Announced preliminary results from clinical study evaluating pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of 1.5mg and 3mg cytisine demonstrating an overall 58% abstinence rate in healthy volunteer smokers Expanded partnership with the University of Bristol for next generation cytisine-based therapies across multiple therapeutic categories Announced final results of clinical study demonstrating similar bioavailability of cytisine in fed and fasted subjects Entered into an exclusive long-term supply agreement with Sopharma AD for clinical and commercial supply of cytisine ""Significant advances in the cytisine development program have been achieved in the short time since the completion of our merger,"" commented Rick Stewart, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Achieve Life Sciences.  ""Clinical progress with cytisine continues to provide evidence supporting the outcome of two, previously conducted Phase 3 trials and the in-market cytisine experience over the last 20 years in Eastern Europe. We look forward to continued collaboration with the smoking cessation community, regulators, and researchers, as we move towards our expected Phase 3 trial initiation later this year."" PK/PD Study Results In February, Achieve announced preliminary results from a study evaluating repeat-dose PK and PD effects of 1.5mg and 3mg cytisine when administered over the standard 25-day course of treatment in 24 healthy volunteer smokers, aged 18-65 years. The PK results indicated expected increases in plasma concentration with higher doses of cytisine. Smokers in the study were not required to have a designated or predetermined quit date, however, 58% of the subjects in the trial achieved biochemically verified smoking abstinence by day 26. Subjects who did not achieve abstinence had a significant reduction in the number of daily cigarettes smoked by the end of treatment. Cytisine was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events reported. The adverse events observed were mostly mild with transient headaches as the most commonly reported event with a slight increase in transient headaches in the 3 mg versus 1.5 mg cytisine dose level. The study is continuing enrollment for subjects aged >65 years. University of Bristol Expanded Partnership In January, Achieve announced an amendment to their Technology License Agreement with the University of Bristol. Achieve has been granted exclusive rights for all human medicinal uses of cytisine derivatives created under the License Agreement across all therapeutic categories. Under the amended collaboration agreement, studies will be conducted to generate and evaluate semi-synthetic cytisine derivatives for potential use in multiple indications across addiction and neurological disorders. Fed/Fasted Study Results In November, 2017, the Company announced final results of a study on the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisine. The study evaluated the bioavailability of a single 3 mg cytisine dose under fed and fasted conditions in 24 healthy volunteer subjects. Study results demonstrated overall bioequivalence when cytisine was administered with or without food. Total excretion levels of cytisine also remained equivalent in both the fed and fasted states. Sopharma Agreement In October 2017, Achieve entered into an exclusive supply agreement with Bulgarian-based Sopharma AD for the manufacture of cytisine's active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) and finished tablets. Achieve will have full access to the cytisine supply chain and Sopharma will manufacture sufficient cytisine to meet specified forecasted demand of cytisine in the Achieve territories. The exclusive license agreement provides supply of cytisine to Achieve for up to 20 years. Sopharma has over 20 years of experience producing cytisine through its commercialization efforts in Central and Eastern Europe. It is estimated that over 20 million people have used cytisine to treat nicotine addiction. Financial Results As of December 31, 2017, the company's cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and restricted cash was $5.6 million. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 were $3.8 million and $6.6 million, respectively. Net loss for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017 was $3.7 million and $10.6 million, respectively. As of March 1, 2018 Achieve had 12,747,932 shares outstanding.

ACHV,"BOTHELL, Wash. and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Achieve Life Sciences, Inc. ACHV, -1.17% a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the global development and commercialization of cytisine for smoking cessation, today announced preliminary data from their Phase I/II multi-dose, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) clinical study of cytisine.    The study, initiated in October 2017, evaluated the repeat-dose PK and PD effects of 1.5mg and 3mg cytisine in 24 healthy volunteer smokers aged 18-65 years when administered over the standard 25-day course of treatment. The PK results indicated expected increases in plasma concentration between the standard and higher doses of cytisine with no evidence of drug accumulation. Smokers in the study were not required to have a designated or predetermined quit date, however, 58% of the subjects overall in the trial achieved biochemically verified smoking abstinence at day 26. Half (6/12) of the subjects on the 1.5mg arm and 67% (8/12) of the subjects on the 3.0mg arm achieved abstinence on day 26. Subjects who did not achieve abstinence had a significant reduction in number of daily cigarettes smoked by the end of treatment. Cytisine was well-tolerated and reported adverse events were mostly mild and short-lived. Transient headache was the most commonly reported event, but was not treatment-limiting. No adverse events were severe, serious, or led to withdrawal from the study. Study results will be included in a clinical symposium on cytisine at the Society for Research on Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) Annual Meeting in Baltimore on Friday, February 23 [rd] . ""The abstinence rates observed with cytisine are particularly impressive given the short 25-day treatment period. In addition, subjects did not commit to quitting and received only minimal behavioral support. Setting an actual quit date and receiving enhanced behavioral support are key factors to improve smoking cessation outcomes,"" said Dr. Cindy Jacobs, Executive Vice President and Chief Medical Officer at Achieve. ""We are encouraged by these results that further support our Phase 3 program that we expect to initiate mid-2018."" Cytisine is a plant-based alkaloid with a high binding affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. It is an established smoking cessation treatment that has been available in Central and Eastern Europe for more than 20 years. Achieve is collaborating with leading opinion leaders and researchers to facilitate cytisine availability globally as well as in the United States. Achieve expects to initiate the cytisine Phase 3 development program in mid-2018 required for FDA approval of cytisine in the United States.  About Achieve and Cytisine Achieve's focus is to address the global smoking health epidemic through the development and commercialization of cytisine. Tobacco use is currently the leading cause of preventable death and is responsible for nearly six million deaths annually worldwide [1]. It is estimated that 28.6% of all cancer deaths in the U.S. are attributable to cigarette smoking [2].

Comparing quit rates at six months, the trial hypothesizes that 12 weeks of cytisine plus behavioral support will be at least as effective as 12 weeks of varenicline plus behavioral support. ""In an effort to achieve New Zealand's Smokefree 2025 goal, smoking rates need to decrease substantially, particularly for Maori and their whanau, who have the highest prevalence of smoking and the slowest decline in prevalence over the last 20 years,"" commented Dr. Natalie Walker, Associate Professor at the University of Auckland and Principal investigator for the RAUORA trial. ""The use of tobacco products and exposure to tobacco smoke is recognized as the leading preventable cause of death worldwide and additional smoking cessation aids need to be made available."" Rick Stewart, Chairman and CEO of Achieve, added, ""We are pleased to contribute cytisine to this important initiative to help improve the health and well-being of Maori and their whanau. This trial is well-aligned with our mission at Achieve, which is to bring cytisine forward as a new treatment option around the globe to help the millions of smokers who are battling nicotine and tobacco addiction."" Cytisine is an established smoking cessation treatment that has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe for more than 20 years.

ACHV, -1.17% a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company committed to the global development and commercialization of cytisine for smoking cessation, today announced results of a clinical study evaluating the effect of food on the bioavailability of 3mg cytisine. The study evaluated the bioavailability of 3 mg cytisine under fed and fasted conditions in 24 healthy volunteer subjects. Study results demonstrated bioequivalence when cytisine was administered with or without food.  Cytisine was extensively absorbed after oral administration with maximum cytisine concentration levels observed in the blood within less than an hour. Total excretion levels of cytisine also remained equivalent in both the fed and fasted states. Further data from this study will be submitted for presentation at an upcoming scientific congress. Additionally, in preparation to initiate a pivotal Phase 3 program in the United States, Achieve recently began enrollment in a multi-dose, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) clinical study. An assessment of PK parameters and PD effects is planned to be conducted on both the 1.5mg standard and 3.0mg higher-dose of cytisine administered over the currently indicated 25-day scheduled duration of cytisine treatment.  The multi-dose PK/PD study is expected to have results within the first-quarter of 2018.  ""We are pleased with the rapid completion of this study in fed versus fasted subjects and the findings that a higher dose of 3 mg cytisine can be administered safely with or without food,"" said Rick Stewart, Chairman and CEO of Achieve.

On August 1, 2017, Achieve announced the closing of its merger with publicly listed OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals.  The prevailing entity combined operations and employees from both companies with shareholders of Achieve becoming the majority stockholders of OncoGenex in a 1-for-11 reverse stock split with the trading symbol transitioning from OGXI to ACHV. On August 10 [th] , the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) accepted Achieve's Investigational New Drug (IND) application for cytisine which provided the Company authorization to commence clinical development of the smoking cessation treatment in the U.S.  Cytisine has been approved and marketed in Central and Eastern Europe for more than 25 years. It is a plant-based alkaloid with a high binding affinity to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor.  It is estimated that over 20 million people have used cytisine to help combat nicotine addiction, including approximately 2,100 patients in Phase 3 clinical trials conducted in Europe and New Zealand. Achieve has also collaborated with the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which has sponsored and completed a number of the preclinical IND-enabling studies . In preparation for initiating cytisine's pivotal Phase 3 program in the U.S., the Company announced on August 16 [th] , its Clinical Development Plan which entails two phase 1/2 studies aimed at assisting the design and implementation of the subsequent Phase 3 program. The first study was the evaluation of the effect of food on the bioavailability of cytisine, which has completed and data analysis is expected in Q4 2017. The second study was the evaluation of repeat-dose pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of cytisine in smokers, which commenced in Q4 2017. Data from this repeat-dose study is expected in the first quarter of 2018. On September 14, the Company announced that it had entered into a share purchase agreement with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC in which Achieve may sell up to $11.0 million of shares of common stock over a 30 month term subject to certain limitations and conditions set forth in the purchase agreement. Through September 30, 2017, the company offered and sold 408,947 shares of common stock to Lincoln Park resulting in proceeds of $1.2 million net of offering costs. As consideration for entering into the Purchase Agreement, we issued to LPC 123,516 shares of common stock; no cash proceeds were received from the issuance of these shares.  Achieve plans to utilize the net proceeds from this offering to advance its product candidate cytisine as well as for general corporate purposes. From October 1, 2017 through November 9, 2017, we offered and sold 464,831 shares of our common stock pursuant to our Purchase Agreement with LPC. These sales resulted in gross proceeds to us of approximately $0.9 million.

ACHV,"BOTHELL, Wash. and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. OGXI today announced financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.  Recent Events In January 2017, Achieve Life Science, Inc. (Achieve) and OncoGenex announced they entered into a definitive merger agreement. In February 2017, OncoGenex announced that apatorsen results from two randomized Phase 2 clinical trials were presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2017 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, held February 16 [th] - 18 [th]  in Orlando. Clinical data from trials in bladder and prostate cancers demonstrated apatorsen was well-tolerated and improved patient outcomes when administered in combination with standard-of-care treatments. In March 2017, Achieve announced a strategic collaboration with the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to conduct non-clinical studies in support of an overall clinical development plan for cytisine as a smoking cessation treatment. As part of the collaboration, Achieve is providing cytisine to the NIH to conduct a series of non-clinical studies required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to support the submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) application. The collaboration commenced in March 2015 and results of the studies are expected in the second-quarter of 2017. In March 2017, the Society for Research in Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) held a symposium on cytisine research at its annual conference held in Florence, Italy. The symposium was chaired by Professor Nancy Rigotti, MD, Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, with presentations from Associate Professor Natalie Walker, PhD, National Institute for Health Innovation, University of Auckland, on ""Cytisine versus Varenicline for Smoking Cessation: Two Clinical Trials from the Australasian Cytisine Trialist Group,"" and ""The Challenge to Getting Cytisine Licensed For Use Worldwide: Policy Considerations."" Dr. Walker was the principal investigator of the 1,310 patient phase 3 CASCAID trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine in December, 2014 titled ""Cytisine versus Nicotine for Smoking Cessation"". Financial Results As of March 31, 2017, the company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments were $16.5 million compared with $25.5 million as of December 31, 2016. Based on current expectations, OncoGenex believes that its cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund its currently planned operations for at least the next 12 months.  Revenue for the three months ended March 31, 2017 decreased to zero from $2.9 million for three months ended March 31, 2016. Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $3.3 million compared to $7.4 million for the same period in 2016.

ACHV,"BOTHELL, Wash. and VANCOUVER, British Columbia, May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- OncoGenex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. OGXI announced today that it will report its first quarter 2017 financial results on Monday, May 15, 2017. About OncoGenex OncoGenex is a biopharmaceutical company committed to the development and commercialization of new therapies that address treatment resistance in cancer patients. The company's product candidate, apatorsen (OGX-427), is designed to inhibit production of Hsp27, disable cancer cells' defenses and overcome treatment resistance. Hsp27 is an intracellular protein that protects cancer cells by helping them survive, leading to resistance and more aggressive cancer phenotypes. Both the potential single-agent activity and synergistic activity of apatorsen with cancer treatments may increase the overall benefit of existing therapies and augment the durability of treatment outcomes, which could lead to increased patient survival.
