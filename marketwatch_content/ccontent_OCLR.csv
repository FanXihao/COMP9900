OCLR,"The stock market finished mostly lower Monday, weighed down by the industrials sector, while the Nasdaq closed at a record, in part due to optimism over Friday’s jobs data, which showed solid economic growth without triggering wage pressure. How did the main benchmarks fare? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.37% fell 157.13 points, or 0.6%, to 25,178.61. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.76% fell 3.55 points, or 0.1%, to 2,783.02, with the industrials sector shedding more than 1.2%. The technology-laden Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -2.25% meanwhile, was up 27.51 points, or 0.4%, to 7,588.32, after hitting an intraday high of 7,609.10. The major indexes are coming off a weekly gain of more than 3%. On Friday, the Dow surged 1.8%, marking the first time the blue-chip index has finished above 25,000 since Feb. 28. The S&P 500 index rose 1.7% on Friday, tied for its biggest one-day percentage gain of 2018, and the Nasdaq climbed 1.8%. Read: In the bull market’s ninth year, ‘winning’ stocks hide lingering pain What drove the markets? With nothing major on the economic-data calendar, the market’s focus will likely remain on last week’s so-called Goldilocks jobs numbers. The nonfarm-payrolls report Friday showed 313,000 jobs were created in February — better than expected — but wage growth came in below expectations. Investors have feared that a tighter labor market could lead to higher inflation on the side of wages, and more pressure from the Fed to pick up the pace of its interest-rate hikes. More interest-rate hikes than the market expects could damp enthusiasm for stocks. Friday’s data and reaction were a marked difference from January jobs report last month, when a jump in hourly earnings growth sparked the first correction for the Dow and the S&P 500 in roughly two years. A correction is defined as a drop of 10% or more for stocks. Investors will get a second indication of inflation this week, with an update on consumer prices due Tuesday. Retail sales are also scheduled for release on Wednesday. Read: The stock market will remain glued to the inflation story Plus: Worry about rising inflation? Sure, but there’s no reason to be scared What were strategists saying? “Market volatility rose following the January employment report and has not calmed down yet. It is likely to stay elevated as investors try to figure out the implications for higher debt auctions; maybe higher interest rates and economic growth will make it all go away. We have made it back to ‘normal’ volatility, with a VIX now between 15-20, which is very different from the abnormally low levels we saw last year,” said Paul Nolte, portfolio manager at Kingsview Asset Management. Nolte also believes there are still unresolved concerns about trade wars, noting that Boeing Co. BA, -1.51% , which was down nearly 3%, accounted for half of the blue-chip index’s decline. “The underlying macroeconomic backdrop is still pretty intact, and stocks continue to be supported by good earnings,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global markets research at Boston Partners. “Rates and inflation are still the big question mark, and they’re by far our biggest risk factors for 2018. We don’t know the trigger point, where bond yields will start to wreak havoc on stocks, but last week’s average hourly earnings numbers gave us some comfort that we’re not there yet.” Despite that, he struck a note of caution on market valuations, calling them “rich across the board.” He added, “I can’t think of an asset class that’s inexpensive, so any values out there are relative.” “Some industrials are down today, and exhibiting what I call ‘little shakeouts’ during uptrends in their price charts, including Boeing Co., Emerson Electric Co. EMR, -2.18% , Eaton Corp. ETN, -2.19% , KLX Inc. KLXI, -2.65% and United Technologies Corp. UTX, -1.49% ” said Crista Huff, chief analyst at Cabot Undervalued Stocks Advisor. “I expect those stocks to continue rising by midweek, barring any unusual bad news hitting the broader stock market.” Which stocks were in focus? Shares of Oclaro Inc. OCLR, -1.31%  jumped 28% after Lumentum Holdings Inc. LITE, -3.06%  said it would acquire the optical components company in a deal valued at $1.8 billion.

GS, -1.73%  rose 1% after the company said that Harvey Schwartz, its co-chief operating officer and president, was set to retire, leaving David Solomon to serve as sole COO and president. The move appears to put the company’s succession plans in focus after The Wall Street Journal on Friday reported that Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein was set to retire as early as the end of 2018.

OCLR,"The bull market (arguably) turned a ripe nine years old in style on Friday, when a strong jobs report slapped an exclamation point on a chaotic week that saw a 3.5% surge on the S&P 500 SPX, -1.18%  . But now, stocks, after a strong start to the trading session, are stumbling a bit as they take a stab at making it to 10. While equity investors savor — and build on — their recent batch of gains, crypto enthusiasts are still trying to steady the ship. Reports of hacking and fear of regulation by the SEC have weighed heavily on virtual currencies of late. It’s a new week, however, and, on Monday, cryptocurrencies initially followed stocks into the green — a trend which is more common these days than it used to be, according to our chart of the day (see below). But that equity-crypto correlation is about to be completely blown up, if Jason Bloomberg, president of industry analyst firm Intellyx, has it right. In our call of the day, he expands on what he believes is the most dangerous threat in 2018: illicit cryptomining, or “cryptojacking” That’s when hackers sneak crypto mining software onto corporate networks, PCs and other devices. “The implications of illicit cryptomining are profoundly frightening,” Bloomberg wrote in a piece for Forbes. “Because this type of cyberattack is ‘relatively’ benign — for certain definitions of ‘relatively’ — it’s positioned to run amuck, taking over computers, networks, data centers and cloud environments around the world.” Check out: Egypt’s government secretly hijacks citizens’ computers to mine crypto And see: Hackers steal computing power to mine cryptos — and they just hit Tesla He says there are many different criminal pursuits that can leverage mining — tax evasion, money laundering and funding terrorism, for instance — but it is illicit mining is “the most nefarious of all criminal motivations.” He says we need “to slay the beast” if we want to keep “this insidious infection” from wreaking havoc because prevention and mitigation technologies will never work. The solution: Bloomberg says cryptos should be made illegal. Yes, illegal. Gone. This hot take, which drew plenty of attention, struck a chord in Reddit’s 622K-member crypto community, where it was slammed as pure “FUD.” It also led to this response on Medium: “Jason Bloomberg is totally clueless. Here’s why.” Key market gauges The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.76%  and the S&P 500 SPX, -1.18%  both had given up early gains by midday trading after opening nicely higher. Gold GCM8, +1.05% understandably, is caught in a risk-on funk, with some pullback going on. Asian markets ADOW, +0.25%  closed with solid gains, while Europe SXXP, +0.44%  is looking rather perky, as well. Bitcoin BTCUSD, +1.24% which lost 18% last week, and other prominent cryptos are joining in the fun with some gains. Read Market Snapshot for more The chart Is bitcoin the new barometer for equity investors? According to the Wall Street Journal, a number of traders seem to think so. If bitcoin falls first, equities soon follow. That’s the pattern. “We’ve begun to watch bitcoin more closely as a sign of speculative enthusiasm,” Doug Ramsey, chief investment officer of the Leuthold Group told WSJ. As you can see from this chart, the correlation between bitcoin and the S&P last month spiked to its highest levels since DataTrek Research first started tracking the relationship at the beginning of 2016: It’s not much of a stretch to think bitcoin and its fellow cryptos would be among the first to fall when things go south. The highest-returning asset tends to be the first to get smoked when risk-off takes over. The buzz Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection Marvel’s “Black Panther” just keeps crushing it at the box office for Disney DIS, -0.35%  , surpassing the $1 billion mark on its 26th day of release. The film has grossed over $562 million in the U.S. and is already the seventh-highest release of all time. It is also set to surpass “The Dark Knight,” becoming the No. 2 superhero release of all time. Oclaro OCLR, -1.41%  shares are soaring after the optical components maker struck a $1.8 billion deal to be bought by Lumentum LITE, -2.94% . Also, Clorox CLX, -1.82%  will acquire Nutranext, a privately held health and wellness company. Tesla confirmed that it suspended production of Model 3 cars for a week during February, in a planned move at the Fremont, Calif. plant. Tesla told Bloomberg it used the downtime to “improve automation” and “address bottlenecks.” This news hits as Tesla deals with pressure to increase production of its new electric sedans. Broadcom AVGO, -2.26%  notched gains, after the Singapore-based chipmaker said it expects to complete the redomicilation to the U.S. by April 3. Unfortunately for Donald Trump, it doesn’t look like the Stormy Daniels saga will be going away any time soon, despite his team’s best efforts.

OCLR,"Here are four stocks either breaking out or setting up for a strong advance according to technical analysis. Allegheny Technologies Inc. ATI, -1.84% broke out on Tuesday with a major thrust, up 31% to $22.28, on 20.7 million shares traded. The move broke the stock out of a falling wedge and through lateral resistance at the December high just above $19, a level that has been keeping the stock at bay for about a year and a half. When you get that kind of a move, it usually means the stock is going higher. The next target is $26, with the secondary target near the channel top in the low- to mid-$30s. CF Industries Holdings Inc. CF, -2.23% like many stocks in the agricultural-chemicals sector, ran on Tuesday, up 4.5% to $36.85, on 10.5 million shares. This stock has been up three days in a row, bouncing off lateral support as well as the rising channel bottom under $32 to gain 5 points in the three days. Watch for a test of its spike high at $37.72 reached in March of last year. If it gets through that, the next line of resistance is around $39 1/2. Oclaro Inc. OCLR, -1.44% appears to be setting up for a strong move, pressuring its triple top just above current levels. On Tuesday, it gained 7.3% to $9.99, on 11.2 million shares traded. The stock intraday got right near overhead resistance above $10 near where it touched in November and December. Having also recently broken out of a declining wedge and held support in the $8 range on several occasions, the stock looks like it wants to blow through this triple top area for a move to the channel top near $13. Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc. US:POT another stock in agricultural chemicals, was up 5% to $19.87, on 16.6 million shares traded Tuesday. That’s the best volume since August. The stock is up 10% since Friday, when it bounced off its channel bottom near $18 and ran. It looks like it wants to see $21, and then $22 1/2. See Harry’s video chart analysis on these stocks.

OCLR,"AFP/Getty Images Election day 2016 marked the coming of a new president. It also marked, much more quietly, the end of the third-quarter earnings season. Both events revealed some winners and losers. Winner and losers Election winners? At least for the first few weeks, Mr. Market was a winner. Most stock indices defied negative expectations embedded in a Trump victory and rose. I'll let the TV pundits divine why what was supposed to be a risk-off event suddenly turned into market melt-up. Investors exposed to small-cap stocks were surely happy, as the Russell 2000 Growth index rose more than 10% in the subsequent two weeks. Could it be that the $2.5 trillion in offshore cash held by big American companies like Apple AAPL, -1.37%  and Alphabet GOOGL, -3.07%  could find its way home and be spent on smaller acquisitions? Now that would be bigly. Election losers? How about large technology companies that might see a cut-back in H-1B visas that make it easier to attract worldwide talent. Tech companies would also be vulnerable to less-free trade or an outright trade war that cripples cross-border supply chains. And spare a thought for Amazon AMZN, -4.60%  leader Jeff Bezos, owner of Trump target The Washington Post. Will more Amazon customers need to start paying state sales taxes, cutting into the e-commerce giant's competitive advantage? We'll just have to let Jeff and The Donald hug it out. What earnings had to say Meanwhile earnings season revealed winners and losers in our benchmark portfolio. Expeditors International EXPD, -1.77%  with a market cap of $9.6 billion, is a shipping-logistics provider headquartered in Seattle. They make their money organizing, consolidating and forwarding goods via air, rail and road. Its September quarter, however, left a lot to be desired. And CEO Jeff Musser was left to provide the “money quote” in Expeditors' Nov. 8 earnings release: ""We grew our business even as rates were rapidly adjusting to a very fluid marketplace and pressuring margins beyond what we would normally expect."" EXPD executed admirably during these tough times, generating substantial cash flow and claiming to be gaining market share. But wait. While global growth has slowed and trade friction has risen in the past year, these really aren't tough times. Shipping costs (mostly energy prices) remain low and there's not much of a geopolitical risk ""tax"" on trade with the world a largely peaceful place. Yet Expeditors is shrinking — revenue was down 5% year over year — while the rest of the world is growing. If you can't thrive when times are good, what's it going to be like when times aren't? Or when, just hypothetically, a new U.S. president takes office determined to repeal or renegotiate major trade agreements on “day one”? I expect we'll be shipping our shares of EXPD the next time we rebalance the portfolio. Sad. More happy was the news from government information technology contractor Leidos LDOS, -0.72% which has a market cap of $7.5 billion. On Nov. 3, the Reston, Virginia-based company offered a clinic in public-company performance. September quarterly earnings were $1.25/share vs. Street expectations of $0.96/share. Operating profit margins were 9.5% vs. 7.2% in the year-earlier quarter. The company's own full-year earnings expectations were raised substantially on the back of an eye-popping book-to-bill ratio of 1.56. Some of the brighter outlook for Leidos is due to the recent acquisition of the Information Systems and Global Solutions division of rival Lockheed Martin LMT, -1.40% But Leidos' existing businesses, themselves spun out of Science Applications International Corp SAIC, +4.22% just three years ago grew organically as well in the quarter. Now, the newly larger Leidos, which the Street expects to report $4.6 billion in 2016 revenue, is firing on all cylinders. And just in time for an all-Republican president and Congress swept into office on pro-military rhetoric and plans for massive infrastructure spending spearheaded by private industry. Did I mention Leidos just reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.56? That's yuge. Happier still were the earnings and outlook from II-VI Inc. IIVI, -1.96% market cap $2.0 billion, on Oct. 25. Pittsburgh-based II-VI makes lasers, optoelectronic components and engineered materials. It markets its products not only to traditional industrial customers, but also to telecommunications carriers and private enterprises for carrying ever more data through fiber-optic cables. II-VI is a lesser-known player in optoelectronics compared with Oclaro OCLR, -1.20% Finisar FNSR, -5.88%  and Neophotonics NPTN, -1.46%  but has benefitted no less from the explosive demand for data transmission. And II-VI's September-quarter performance was explosive: Revenue was up 17% year-over-year, bookings up 31% and non-GAAP operating margins increased to 14.1% from 12.5% year over year. What about the future? II-VI reported a book-to-bill ratio of 1.1 at the end of September, which is really good. You might even say it's tremendous.

OCLR,"Editor’s Note: This is a free edition of The Technical Indicator, a daily MarketWatch subscriber newsletter. To get this column each market day, click here. Technically speaking, the U.S. markets’ bigger-picture backdrop continues to support a firmly-bullish view. Consider that each major stock benchmark has reached less-charted territory, amid broadening sector participation, while selling pressure remains conspicuously absent. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s SPX, -2.59%  hourly chart highlights the past two weeks. As illustrated, the S&P has twice topped at 2,175, a level defining its all-time high. The pullbacks remain flat. From current levels, an inflection point holds around 2,169, and is followed by near-term support at 2,155. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has pulled in modestly from record highs. To reiterate, first support holds around 18,470, an area it’s thus far maintained on a closing basis. On further weakness, a deeper floor holds around 18,415, and is followed by firmer support at the 18,350 mark. And the Nasdaq Composite’s near-term backdrop is slightly stronger. Consider that it’s rallied to the 5,100 mark — topping within three points, across four straight sessions — and is holding tightly to the range top. From current levels, first support rests at 5,063, and is followed by a deeper floor at 5,045, matching a former weekly high. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq has knifed to the 5,100 mark, and selling pressure remains muted. Additional overhead matches the late-December peak of 5,117, while the Nasdaq’s next significant resistance rests at 5,164, a level closely matching the June and November 2015 peaks. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has sustained the July breakout. Consider that it’s rallied as much as 1,559 points, or 9.1%, from the June low. To reiterate, the Dow’s first notable support rests at 18,350, and is followed by the April peak of 18,167, and a firmer floor slightly above the 18,000 mark. And the S&P 500 has rallied as much as 183 points, or 9.2%, from the June low. Though still near-term extended, the S&P’s directionally sharp breakout, and flat initial pullback, support a bullish longer-term view. The bigger picture Technically speaking, the major U.S. benchmarks have reached less-charted territory, and are refusing to pull in — bullish price action. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF’s IWM, -2.30%  backdrop is increasingly familiar. It’s established a bullish flag, compressing between the June peak and the 120 area. (Resistance technically spans from 120.40 to 120.65, matching last week’s close and high respectively.) This is a continuation pattern, and a breakout attempt is in play barring a violation of support around 118.60. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 MDY, -2.41%  tagged a fractional all-time high last week. But practically speaking, it’s range-bound, capped by resistance spanning from 282.50 to 282.75. Conversely, support closely matches the June peak of 278.33. Combined, the small- and mid-cap benchmarks have asserted a bullish posture. Trading ranges are more frequently exited in the direction in which they were entered, in this case improving the chances of an eventual break higher. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 Index is acting well technically. Recall that the July breakout was preceded by — and is still underpinned by — three 9-to-1 up days. (An “up day” means that advancing volume surpassed declining volume by the given margin.) It’s subsequently extended the break to record territory amid shallow and short-lived pullbacks. (By breaking to record territory, each S&P 500 investor has a gain. Nobody is waiting to reach a break-even point — defined by resistance — and sell. Thus, prices need to rise to draw sellers, and they are rising, though selling pressure remains muted.) Meanwhile, the sub-sector backdrop supports a bullish view amid broadening participation. This includes a very recent rotation toward former laggards, the homebuilders and biotech sector — profiled last week — and even the retail sector, detailed in the next section. So collectively, the S&P 500’s straightline July breakout is longer-term bullish, though it remains near-term extended, and attractive on pullbacks. The S&P’s first significant floor matches the 2015 close of 2,131, and is followed by the former 2016 range top, spanning from 2,117 to 2,120. (Also see: Charting the S&P 500’s break to ‘clear skies’ territory.) Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Profiled last week, as technically vulnerable, the United States Oil Fund USO, -2.90%  has reached three-month lows. The fund tracks the price of West Texas Intermediate (WTI) light, sweet crude oil. Technically, the USO has asserted a downtrend, and is traversing less-charted territory. Next support spans from the mid-April low of 9.80 to 10.00. Conversely, notable resistance holds around 10.50 — matching the 2015 low of 10.52 — and an eventual close higher would place the brakes on bearish momentum. More broadly, the U.S. equity markets’ formerly strong correlation with crude oil prices has cracked post-Brexit. The S&P 500 has knifed to all-time highs amid the July oil downturn. Against this backdrop, the SPDR S&P Retail ETF XRT, -2.63%  has come to life. In concept, lower crude oil prices translate to increased consumer discretionary spending, offering a tailwind to the retailers. Technically, the group has resolved a double bottom — the W formation, defined by the May and June lows — clearing the 200-day moving average and trendline resistance. Both events signal a trend shift, and the group’s technical bias points higher barring a violation of the breakout point, circa 43.20. Moving to specific names, American Eagle Outfitters, Inc. AEO, -1.88%  is a well positioned mid-cap retailer. Earlier this month, the shares reached 11-month highs, edging atop the March peak. Underlying the upturn, its relative strength index (not illustrated) has reached 52-week highs, improving the chances of a more decisive breakout. First support closely matches the 17 mark, and its technical bias points higher barring a violation. Nordstrom, Inc. JWN, -2.40%  is a large-cap retailer coming to life. As illustrated, the shares have recently reached two-month highs, resolving a bullish double bottom, and clearing resistance matching the bottom of the May gap. It’s subsequently established a bullish flag — underpinned by the breakout point — positioning the shares to extend the nascent uptrend. Consider that this week’s upturn has been fueled by increased volume. Activision Blizzard, Inc. ATVI, -3.65%  is a well positioned large-cap video game maker. Earlier this month, the shares rallied to all-time highs, clearing resistance matching the 2015 peak. The ensuing pullback has been comparably flat, signaling that bullish momentum is intact. Activision is also well positioned on the weekly chart, and its path of least resistance points higher barring a violation of the 40 breakout point. Oclaro, Inc. OCLR, -1.26%  is a small-cap manufacturer of lasers and optical communications subsystems and components. Technically, the shares have knifed to five-year highs, rising after a favorable analyst note detailing the fiber-optic networking sector. Though near-term extended, the shares are also well positioned on the monthly chart. A pullback toward the 5.50 breakout point would offer an attractive entry.

OCLR,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — The technology sector slipped into the red Tuesday as gains in shares of semiconductor and optical-components companies were overshadowed by slumping shares of Hewlett-Packard Co. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -2.44%  gave up earlier gains to close at 3,120, down 2 points, or about 0.1%. H-P HPQ, -2.96%  lost 1.1% to close at $23.62, one of the top decliners on the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.08%  which lost 44 points. The Morgan Stanley High Tech 35 Index MSH, +0.00%  and the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index SOX, -3.10%  were each down by a fraction. Networking shares highlighted the tech sector’s early gains, with Juniper Networks and JDS Uniphase Corp. JDSU  each rising more than 3%. Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, -3.89%   rose 0.3% to close at $20.91. What is Apple CEO Tim Cook Doing in China? JDS Uniphase’s gains were sparked by news of a merger between two optical component vendors, Oclaro Inc. OCLR, -0.89%  and Opnext Inc. OPXT which one analyst noted would mean consolidation in that market. Shares of Oclaro plunged 6.4% to close at $4.36, while Opnext was up 53%, closing at $1.73. “The optical-components industry received a gift yesterday,” Credit Suisse analyst William Stein said in a note. “Two meaningful but we believe sub-scale vendors ... announced a merger that will remove capacity from, and we believe improve profitability of, the optical-components industry.” Stein said the consolidation will likely be positive for other optical-components companies including JDS Uniphase and Finisar Corp.

Jefferies analyst Sundeep Bajikar initiated coverage of Micron with a buy rating, citing the growth prospects in the memory-chip market, especially the rapid adoption of solid state drive technology. Meanwhile, Citigroup analyst Glen Yeung reiterated an upbeat view of the semiconductor sector, suggesting in a note that investors may be taking an overly cautious stance. “A look at volumes in the chip sector reveals a degree of hesitancy amongst chip investors, ostensibly fearing uncertain macro outcomes and high relative valuations,” Yeung wrote. “While we see potential for short pullbacks across the sector, we are increasingly confident in our bullish stance on the sector.” On the downside, shares of Zynga Inc. ZNGA, -2.60% Advanced Micro Devices AMD, -3.98%  and Microsoft Corp. MSFT, -2.57%  were in the red.

OCLR,"Oclaro Inc. OCLR, -0.84% Monday agreed to merge with fellow optical-components maker Opnext Inc. OPXT in an all-stock deal valued at about $42.9 million as of Monday's close. Opnext shares leapt 56% to $1.76 in after-hours trading following an earlier halt on the stock. Oclaro shares were up as much as 3% at $4.80 after hours. The deal, expected to close within three to six months, gives Opnext stockholders 0.42 Oclaro share for each common share of Opnext, giving them a roughly 42% stake in the new company. Oclaro, which makes optical parts used in products ranging from the telecommunications industry to the scientific applications, said the deal will build a company better suited to serve companies' growing appetite for bandwidth, driven by the proliferation of data-intensive videos and cloud computing. Opnext also makes data components for a wide variety of electronics. The combined company will also serve a growing market for laser diodes, electronic components that are used in a wide range of industrial and consumer applications. ""Our respective customers want to work with fewer, more strategic suppliers who can deliver the breadth of technologies they need,"" said Oclaro Chairman and Chief Executive Alain Couder, who will lead the combined company. Opnext Chairman Harry Bosco will join the combined company's board of directors. The combined company is expected to post an adjusted profit in its first full quarter while saving between $35 million and $45 million through cost synergies within 18 months of the deal's close. The company expects to take on $20 million to $30 million in restructuring and integration costs. Oclaro was among the technocentric companies hampered by last year's Thai floods, which washed out roads and waterlogged manufacturing plants.

CINCINNATI (MarketWatch) — The major U.S. benchmarks have kicked off September with yet another sharp downdraft. And technically speaking, the weak start follows a failed test of major resistance. Before detailing the U.S. markets’ wider view, the S&P 500’s hourly chart highlights the past three weeks. As illustrated, the S&P topped last week at 1,230, matching longer-term resistance detailed last week. (See the Aug. 23 and Aug. 30 reviews.) From current levels, initial support holds at 1,155 and is followed by a major floor at this year’s closing low of 1,120. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials near-term backdrop is similar. Namely, the index is traversing the middle of its three-week range. From current levels, initial support holds at 11,085 and is followed by a firmer floor around 10,800. And not surprisingly, the Nasdaq Composite’s three-week view remains volatile. Initial support now holds around 2,437, and is followed by a deeper floor around 2,408, matching the Aug. 26 open. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. Very simply, the Nasdaq has failed a test of its breakdown point. (See the Aug. 12 and Aug. 15 reviews.) Consider that the index topped last week at 2,611 — matching resistance at 2,600 — and has since sold off sharply. Bearish price action. Moving to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, its six-month backdrop remains bearish. Consider that the index plunged 2,147 points from the late-July peak to the August low. This marked a 16.8% downdraft across just 13 sessions. By comparison, the ensuing rally attempt has been flat, meaning that the Dow’s longer-term path of least resistance technically points lower. And the S&P 500’s six-month view rounds out the benchmarks. Here again, the S&P staged a nearly straightline plunge from the late-July peak. To the extent that an immediate V-shaped reversal was possible — which, it wasn’t —- enough time has passed that the “easy out” is likely off the table. The bigger picture The major U.S. benchmarks have kicked off September with a sharp downdraft. And technically speaking, the weak start follows a failed test of major resistance. Starting with the Nasdaq, it’s failed the first test of its breakdown point. Specifically, the index topped last week at 2,611 — matching the 2,600 resistance — and has since gapped sharply lower. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 has also failed a major technical test. In its case, the S&P failed to reach its breakdown point — the 1,250 area — and has sold off sharply from the late-August peak. And widening to the S&P 500’s five-year backdrop adds color. Consider that the S&P topped last week at 1,230, matching longer-term resistance at 1,227, detailed last week. (See the Aug. 23 and Aug. 30 reviews.) Moreover, the downturn was driven by sharply negative market breadth. Specifically, down volume surpassed up volume by 19 to 1 on the NYSE, and by 14 to 1 on the Nasdaq. More plainly, bearish market momentum is firmly intact. Summing up the backdrop The major U.S. benchmarks signaled a primary downtrend on Aug. 3. (See the Aug. 3 review, and the Aug. 1 review.) Fast forward to today, and the downturn was confirmed last week. Namely, the Nasdaq Composite has plunged from resistance at 2,600, while the S&P 500 has also drawn sellers around major resistance. So looking ahead, an eventual retest of the August lows is now more likely. A defensive approach remains advisable, and the market bias technically points lower pending further technical repairs. The S&P’s response to support at 1,120, and resistance around 1,230, should be a useful bull/bear gauge. Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names -- sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Traditional market leaders fail technical test Drilling down further, consider that key sectors have also failed a technical test: The Technology Select Sector SPDR XLK, -2.34% the Financial Select Sector SPDR XLF, -2.61%  and the iShares Dow Transports IYT, -2.02% As illustrated, each group has drawn sellers at the August range top. Moreover, the downdraft from resistance has been directionally sharp, likely positioning each for an eventual retest of the August lows. These are traditional market leaders, and their relative weakness remains a broad-market headwind. Company Symbol Fri Close Support Resistance McDonald’s Corp. MCD $89.09 $87.80 $91.20 Initially profiled June 7, McDonald’s Corp. MCD, +0.08%  has returned 9.8% and remains well positioned. (Yield = 2.7%.) Late last month, the shares broke to all-time highs, clearing resistance at the July peak. Since then, it has sustained its gains, and a pullback toward the breakout point would offer an attractive entry. Company Symbol Fri Close Support Resistance Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGN $64.78 $60.70 $67.00 Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. REGN, -4.25%  is a well positioned large-cap name. Late last week, the shares knifed to four-month highs, rising on reports of poor performance from a rival’s product. Though near-term extended, its strong-volume spike is longer-term bullish, and a pullback toward the breakout point would mark a high risk/reward entry. Company Symbol Fri Close Support Resistance Universal Display Corp. PANL $49.85 $46.90 $54.00 Universal Display Corp. PANL, -1.13%  is a mid-cap developer of technologies used in flat-panel displays. As illustrated, the shares have staged a strong-volume breakout, rising on the announcement of new contracts with LG Electronics and Samsung. By comparison, the ensuing pullback has been flat, and its light-volume pullback positions the shares to build on the mid-August spike. Company Symbol Fri Close Support Resistance Finisar Corp. FNSR $20.21 $19.20 $20.60 Finisar Corp. FNSR, -4.68%  is a mid-cap optical networker coming to life. As illustrated, the shares have knifed atop a four-month downtrend that closely tracks the 50-day moving average. Its upturn signals a trend shift, though a pullback from recent highs would offer a higher risk/reward entry. Company Symbol Fri Close Support Resistance Oclaro, Inc. OCLR $4.55 $4.20 $4.95 Oclaro, Inc. OCLR, -1.05%  is a small-cap maker of optical components used in telecom networks. Technically speaking, the shares have edged atop a four-month downtrend that closely tracks the 20-day moving average. (Last week’s volume spike was driven by Finisar’s quarterly results.) Both events signal a trend shift, and its path of least resistance points higher barring a violation of trendline support.

OCLR,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Ciena Corp. shares rose more than 20% Thursday, but the optical networker proved to be a rare gainer on a day highlighted by broad losses across the tech sector. Ciena CIEN, -1.66%  rose $2.47 a share, or more than 20%, to $14.71 after the company reported a fiscal third-quarter loss of $31.5 million, or 33 cents a share, on revenue of $435 million. During the same period a year ago, Ciena lost $110 million, or $1.18 a share, on $390 million in sales. AT&T Can Still Pull Off the T-Mobile Deal Excluding one-time items, Ciena would have earned 8 cents a share, while analysts surveyed by FactSet had forecast the company to lose 7 cents a share on $444 million in revenue.

Suva said he made the move because he believes the odds of AT&T Inc. T, -1.56%  acquiring T-Mobile USA have declined dramatically because the Justice Department is suing to block the proposed $39 billion deal, and holding onto T-Mobile’s business should benefit Brightpoint while the suit progresses.

OCLR,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Optical-networking companies, which are typically among the most-volatile in all of the tech sector, found themselves facing the ire of investors Thursday following a disappointing earnings report and quarterly outlook from Finisar Corp. Finisar FNSR, -4.78%  shares fell $3.48, or almost 20%, to $14.33 after the company said late Wednesday that it earned $16.4 million, or 17 cents a share, on revenue of $236.9 million. Excluding one-time items, Finisar would have earned 33 cents a share, to meet the estimates of analysts surveyed by FactSet Research. TimeFinisar Corp.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:FNSR $15 $20 $25 However, analysts had also forecast Finisar to post sales of $242.8 million. And for its current, fiscal first quarter, Finisar said it expects to earn between 16 cents and 20 cents a share, on revenue of $221 million to $236 million, far below analysts’ estimates of earnings of 36 cents a share on $250.6 million. That outlook drove Finisar’s shares to their lowest points of the year, and the stock has fallen by almost 50%, since the year began. Along with Finisar, other optical-networking stocks suffered, with Oclaro Corp. OCLR, -1.15%  down by 34 cents a share, or almost 5%, to $6.64; Ciena Corp. CIEN, -1.78%  off by 62 cents a share, or 3.4%, to trade at $17.49 and JDS Uniphase Corp. JDSU  shedding 50 cents a share, or 3.3%, to fall to $15.99. digits: The First Tablet Thinner Than iPad 2 William Stein, an analyst with Credit Suisse, cut his rating on Finisar to neutral from outperform and slashed his price target on the stock nearly in half, to $16 a share from $29. Stein said investor sentiment toward Finisare may erode even further. “We believe that the weak July quarter guidance is unlikely to mark the bottom in fundamentals, “ Stein said, in a research note. “Neither management, nor our industry checks suggest Finisar’s revenue will rebound in October.” Citigroup analyst Kevin Dennean left his hold rating on Finisar’s stock unchanged, but cut his price target on the stock to $16.50 a share from $25.50. Dennean said Finisar is likely to see more problems resulting from inventory issues of its major Chinese network customers. “Finisar highlights further optical [industry] weakness,” added Brian White, of Ticonderoga Securities. In a research note, White noted that earlier this year, Finisar mentioned “a meaningful inventory correction that included a slowdown in demand from China.” White also said a decline in demand for optical components could affect Finisar and other optical networkers over the next several quarters.

OCLR,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Optical networking is one of the most volatile markets in technology, and on Thursday, for the second time in about a week, companies in the sector saw what can happen when even a small player says business might be difficult in the upcoming months. This time it was Oclaro Inc. OCLR, -1.41% which makes components used to separate light signals in telecom networks. Its products include things such as tunable laser transmitters and pump laser chips. It’s all pretty technical, and before the market opened Thursday, Oclaro said its customers don’t seem to be needing as many technicalities as hoped for heading into the end of the year. Oclaro shares plunged $5.08, or more than 78%, to close at $8.60 after the company reported a fiscal first-quarter profit of $356,000, or a penny a share, on revenue of $121.3 million. During the same period a year ago, Oclaro earned $10.6 million or 22 cents a share. Revenue rose to $121.3 million from $112.7 million. Rex on Techs: Ellison's Firing at Will However, excluding one-time items, Oclaro would have earned 6 cents a share, while analysts were expecting a profit of 22 cents a share on $123.3 million in sales. For its second quarter, Oclaro said it expects sales to be between $116 million and $124 million, far below analysts expectations of $128.5 million in revenue. Executives at Oclaro said the weakness began with a slowdown in sales in late September that will extend through the end of the year. In a statement, Chief Executive Alain Coulder added that the company was still confident about its opportunities in 2011, but acknowledged that “our guidance for the December quarter is cautious.” It was the second time in nine days that a quarterly warning by an optical networker led to a case of guilt by association in among the sector’s stocks. On Oct. 19, Infinera Corp. INFN, -1.84%  said its current quarter earnings and sales would fall below Wall Street estimates; the company’s stock tumbled by more than 35%, leading to a selloff among optical networkers that was repeated Thursday following Oclaro’s warning. JDS Uniphase Inc. JDSU  fell by $1.32, or 11.4%, to close at $10.24, making it the biggest decliner on the S&P 500 Index SPX, -2.94% Adding insult to injury, RBC Capital Markets analyst Mark Sue cut his rating on JDS stock to sector perform, or neutral, from outperform and also lowered his target price on the shares to $13 from $16. TimeOclaro Inc.15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:OCLR $6 $8 $10 In a research note, he wrote that the optical-components firms are facing a slowdown in the rate of order bookings to actual billings, or payments on orders. “The rate of growth may be slowing as most equipment customers may have built enough inventories to catch up with the acceleration in demand we saw earlier this year,” Sue said. Along with Oclaro and JDS, other optical networkers in the red included Finisar Corp. FNSR, -5.95% down $1.17 a share, or 6.5%, to close at $16.86; Ciena Corp. CIEN, -2.24% down 43 cents, or 3%, to end the day at $13.32; and Infinera, which shed 15 cents a share to close at $8.25.

OCLR,"Editor’s Note: This is a free edition of The Technical Indicator, a daily MarketWatch subscriber newsletter. To get this column, including 100 technical stock picks every month, click here. CINCINNATI (MarketWatch) -- Following a steep September spike, the U.S. markets have extended slightly higher to start the fourth quarter. Against this backdrop, the recent price action remains relatively technical, keeping market bulls on the offensive as detailed below. The S&P 500’s hourly chart details the past three weeks. As illustrated, the S&P bottomed late last week at 1,151 -- matching major support -- before reversing to a “higher high” on Monday. Constructive price action. From current levels, initial support holds at 1,162, and is followed by a more significant floor at the January peak of 1,150. Meanwhile, the Dow industrials’ near-term backdrop is similar. In its case, the blue-chip benchmark bottomed late last week at 10,892, matching the former range top, before rallying just above the 11,000 mark. Looking ahead, modest support holds at 10,975, and is followed by a deeper floor around 10,890. And not surprisingly, the Nasdaq Composite remains within a near-term uptrend. Note that the index has established support around 2,366, an area matching the top of last week’s gap. From current levels, the 2,400 mark remains a near-term inflection point, and is followed by deeper floors around 2,386 (not illustrated) and the 2,366 gap support. Widening the view to six months adds color. As illustrated, the Nasdaq has sustained a break from its summer trading range, extending to four-month highs. The steep slope of its September rally is longer-term bullish, and on further strength, an intermediate-term target holds at the mid-May peak of 2,434. Moving to the Dow, its six-month view is similar. On a near-term basis, the blue-chip benchmark is flirting with the 11,000 mark, closing Monday at 11,010. From current levels, longer-term resistance holds at 11,205, an area matching the April closing peak. (The year’s best close.) And the S&P 500’s wider view rounds out the major benchmarks. Again, the index bottomed at 1,151 late last week -- matching the January peak -- and its successful retest keeps its uptrend in play. The bigger picture Following a steep September spike, the U.S. markets have extended slightly higher to start the fourth quarter. And against this backdrop, the recent price action remains relatively technical. Starting with support, each benchmark closely observed a notable floor late last week. Specifically: The S&P 500 bottomed at 1,151, matching the 1,150 January peak. The Dow bottomed at 10,892, matching the former range top in the 10,886-to-10,890 area. The Nasdaq bottomed at 2,368, matching gap support at 2,366. The areas above are illustrated on the hourly charts, and upon holding support, each benchmark reversed to a “higher high.” Bullish price action. Conversely, each benchmark’s next significant resistance falls out as follows: S&P resistance at 1,173, matching the post-flash-crash high. (The S&P topped Monday just under resistance, at 1,168.) Dow resistance at 11,205, matching the April closing high. Nasdaq resistance at 2,434, matching its post-flash-crash high. When considering the ceilings above, note that the S&P and the Nasdaq remain capped by their post-flash-crash highs, while the Dow has already cleared its corresponding level of 10,920. And the Dow’s positive divergence is constructive. Large-caps have led the current leg higher -- they tend to pay dividends, and are less dependant on the U.S. dollar -- and the Dow’s positive divergence improves the chances of eventual follow through for the broader markets. Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names -- sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Solar sector comes to life Drilling down to sectors, the charts above illustrate the recent solar resurgence: Yingli Green Energy Holding YGE, +0.59%  , SunPower Corp. SPWRA  and Canadian Solar CSIQ, -0.68% Technically speaking, the group staged a strong-volume late-September spike, culminating at multi-month highs. By comparison, the ensuing pullback has been shallow -- suggesting sellers are absent -- positioning the group to build on last month’s breakout. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Oclaro, Inc. OCLR $16.34 $15.40 $16.80 Initially profiled Oct. 4, Oclaro, Inc. OCLR, -1.31%  remains well positioned. Late last month, the shares knifed to nearly three-year highs, clearing resistance at the May peak. Since then, it’s sustained the breakout, and its tight October trading range positions the shares to extend recent gains. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance J. Crew Group JCG $34.69 $33.10 $35.90 J. Crew Group JCG  is a beaten-down retailer coming to life. As illustrated, the shares have recently cleared a five-month downtrend, also edging atop the 50-day moving average. Both events signal a potential trend shift, and its backdrop would further strengthen on a break atop the September peak. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Lufkin Industries LUFK $46.45 $44.80 New High Lufkin Industries LUFK  is a mid-cap provider of oil field equipment and services. With this week’s upturn, the shares have knifed to two-year highs, clearing a well-defined range top. Though near-term extended, its sharp breakout is longer-term bullish, and a pullback toward first support would mark an attractive entry. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Massey Energy MEE $35.68 $34.50 $38.00 Massey Energy MEE, -1.40%  is a mid-cap coal producer positioned to rise. Technically speaking, the shares have edged to four-month highs, clearing resistance at the August peak. The slight breakout leaves Massey with limited immediate resistance, and a new uptrend is in play barring a break back into its former range. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance SM Energy Company SM $40.04 $38.00 $40.20 SM Energy Company SM, -9.98%  is a mid-cap oil and gas name coming to life. As illustrated, the shares have recently knifed atop a three-month downtrend, also clearing the major moving averages. Moreover, Monday’s rally came on increased volume -- improving the chances of further follow through -- and a new uptrend is in play barring a violation of the 50-day moving average.

OCLR,N/A,N/A,N/A,Craig-Hallum: Lumentum's Oclaro Purchase Could Trigger Further M&A In Optical Sector,http://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/18/03/11352652/craig-hallum-lumentums-oclaro-purchase-could-trigger-fu?utm_campaign=partner_feed&utm_source=marketwatch.com&utm_medium=web_click&utm_content=ticker_page
OCLR,"It comes as no surprise to many on Wall Street that Oclaro Inc. (NASDAQ: OCLR) was bought in a cash and stock for $1 billion by Lumentum Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: LITE). For the past few years, many analysts predicted mergers and acquisition activity in this space and others, as the bigger companies looked to address growth and new capabilities by purchasing smaller companies. While nobody knows for sure the next sector target, we found four companies in the cybersecurity world that are all rated Buy at Merrill Lynch and would be very logical targets. Mostly they are small in size, have specific niche products others don't provide, and probably would be open to a buyout proposal. Even if they don’t end up in the hands of a bigger player, they are solid plays for aggressive growth accounts looking for more exposure to this fast-growing sector. This stock was on fire a couple of years ago but was absolutely eviscerated after numerous earnings misses. FireEye Inc. (NASDAQ: FEYE) has been mentioned over the years as a takeover target, and trading 85% below highs that were printed this time three years ago, it may indeed be on the radar. The company provides network security solutions addressing advanced persistent threats, which traditional IT security tools like anti-virus, intrusion prevention systems, email/web gateways and firewalls, have largely failed to protect from. These solutions typically compare incoming traffic to a list of known threat signatures, failing to identify and protect against unknown targeted attacks, versus FireEye's solution that focuses on the behavior of traffic rather than a signature. The company posted solid fourth-quarter results and released a 2018 outlook that's pretty much in line with Wall Street expectations. New products and new endpoint security features are positives as well. The Merrill Lynch price target is $20, and the Wall Street consensus target is $17.93. Shares closed Monday at $17.81. This company has less than a $2 billion market cap, which makes it a prime takeover target. CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ: CYBR) claims to be the only security company focused on eliminating the most advanced cyber threats, those that use insider privileges to attack the heart of the enterprise. The company proactively secures against cyber threats before attacks can escalate and do irreparable damage. It is estimated that at least 35% of the Fortune 100 and 17 of the world’s top 20 banks use the software to protect high-value information assets, infrastructure and applications. CyberArk pioneered a new layer of IT security solutions that protect organizations from cyberattackers that have evaded the network perimeter. CyberArk solutions secure an organization's critical assets, dubbed privileged accounts, which are the keys to databases, industrial control systems, servers and applications, all which house sensitive data. CyberArk software is focused on protecting these accounts, which are highly targeted in cyberattacks to disrupt networks or steal sensitive info. Merrill Lynch has a $60 price objective, and the consensus target price is $55.11. Shares closed Monday at $51.31. This is another small cap company, at $1.36 billion, that could be an easy bolt-on buy for a bigger player. ForeScout Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ: FSCT) is a pure-play leader in the high-growth security sub-segment of network access control. These products help safeguard networks by providing endpoint detection, visibility and policy control across laptops, mobile devices and the Internet of Things (IoT). ForeScout CounterACT platform is differentiated by its agent-less and vendor-agnostic approach, and it offers Extended Modules to tightly integrate and orchestrate actions across third-party security partners. The analysts said this when the company reported earnings: The $36 Merrill Lynch price objective compares with the consensus estimate of $32.67. The stock ended trading on Monday at $35.93. Many on Wall Street have stayed positive on this network security company, but it would be a larger play with almost a $10 billion market cap. Fortinet Inc. (NASDAQ: FTNT) is a pioneer in the unified threat management segment of network security solutions. Its security appliances offer the ability to run multiple security functions simultaneously, without a significant drop in throughput, enabled by Fortinet's unique custom-ASIC architecture. The company reported solid third-quarter results, but guidance for fourth-quarter revenue and billings came in lower than expected. In fact, the company’s management sees risk related to macro weakness in North Asia/Caribbean, soft Service Provider spending and complex sales cycles. Baird analysts had this say: The Merrill Lynch price target is $57. The consensus target is $50.96, and shares closed Monday at $54.68. Cybersecurity has become one of the most sensitive issues in business and government over the past few years. Needless to say, the Russian meddling during the elections and the plethora of massive hack attacks on company databases has driven the continued urgency and need for the products provided.

OCLR,"Oclaro Inc. (NASDAQ: OCLR) saw its shares surge early on Monday after it was announced that the company would be acquired by Lumentum Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: LITE). This acquisition comes in the midst of acquisition rumors swirling in the semiconductor space concerning the likes of Intel and Broadcom. As for Oclaro, Lumentum is paying a total of roughly $1.8 billion in cash and stock. The transaction breaks down for each Oclaro shareholder to receive $5.60 in cash and 0.0636 of a share of Lumentum common stock. Overall this transaction is valued at $9.99 per share. At the close of this transaction, Oclaro stockholders are expected to own approximately 16% of the combined company. The transaction is expected to generate more than $60 million of annual run-rate synergies within 12 to 24 months of the closing and be immediately accretive to non-GAAP earnings per share, although the firm did not give a number. Note that the board of directors for each company unanimously approved this deal, and it is expected to close in the second half of 2018. One thing to pay attention to, and the question investors always need ask in these acquisition situations, is whether the shareholders are getting enough in this deal. Looking at the charts, this deal offers premiums of 45% and 24%, compared to the 50-day and 200-day moving averages of $6.87 and $8.06, respectively. If we look a little further back, we’d see that this was a $9 or so stock for most of 2017. However, prior to 2016 this was really just a $2 stock. This would be an incredible return for investors who were in this company for the long haul. Alan Lowe, Lumentum's president and chief executive, commented: Shares of Oclaro were last seen up more than 25% at $9.85, with a consensus analyst price target of $7.93 and a 52-week trading range of $5.61 to $10.93. Lumentum shares were up more than 4% at $71.89, with a consensus price target of $75.56 and a 52-week range of $40.35 to $72.95.
