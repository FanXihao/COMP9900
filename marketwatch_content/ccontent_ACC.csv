ACC,"Getty Images In honor of our nation’s 238th birthday, we have put together a big list of publicly traded companies whose names include the words “America” or “United States,” or any abbreviation or combination of the two. Whimsical? A bit. Silly? Certainly not. Any arbitrary method of producing a decent-sized list of publicly traded companies is sure to highlight some quality stocks for further inspection. We began with the components of the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% the S&P MidCap 400 MID, +1.35%   and the S&P SmallCap 600 SML, +0.99%  and added a list of U.S. energy stocks supplied by FactSet. We then pared the list to companies with any version of the nation’s name, with market values of at least $100 million. That left us with 47 stocks. The 20 listed above had an average total return of 20% during the first half of the year, which was nearly triple the total return of the benchmark S&P 500 Index. The financial sector is best represented on the list, with real estate investment trusts, big banks and insurance companies. There are also plenty of oil and gas stocks, and a few utilities. What follows is a brief discussion for each of the 20 best “American” stock performers during the first half of 2014. You can click on each company’s name to see current stock quotes and lists of articles mentioning the company. U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA, +0.51%  of Frederick, Md., was the top-performing “American” stock, with a total return of 63.5% through Monday’s close. The company provides silicate products for use in oil and gas production, and manufacturing. It has grown its annual sales per share for four straight years. The stock rose 9% on April 29 after the company reported a 45% increase in sales of sand used in hydraulic fracturing. “We are currently sold out of all grades of frac sand and believe that industry demand growth will continue to outpace planned supply additions,” CEO Bryan Shinn said in the company’s earnings release. U.S. Silica expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2014 to increase to a range of $180 million to $200 million from $160.8 million in 2013. The stock closed at $55.44 on Monday, and trades for 19.1 times the consensus 2015 earnings estimate of $2.91 a share, among analysts polled by FactSet, up from an estimated $1.97 this year. Skechers USA Inc. SKX, +1.38%  of Manhattan Beach, Calif., ranks a distant second with a total return of 38%. The footwear maker reported a 21% increase in first-quarter sales to $546.5 million, as earnings more than quadrupled to $31 million, or 61 cents a share. The stock closed at $45.70 Monday and trades for 17.3 times the consensus 2015 EPS estimate of $2.64. The 2014 EPS estimate is $2.16. Shares of PharMerica Corp. US:PMC  of Louisville, Ky., returned 33% to close at $28.59. The company provides generic drugs to hospitals and health-care facilities. First-quarter revenue grew 3% to $452.2 million, and the gross profit margin slipped to 18% from 19% a year earlier. CEO Greg Weishar, in the earnings release May 1, reiterated the company’s plan to deploy operating cash flow “to enhance gross margins.” Reynolds American Inc. US:RAI  of Winston-Salem, N.C., is the second-largest cigarette maker in the U.S., and its stock has returned 24% this year to $60.35, assuming dividends were reinvested. Tobacco stock are cash plays, and Reynolds American boasts a dividend yield of 4.44%. First-quarter sales grew 2.8% to $1.94 billion, while rising costs for marketing its Vuse digital-vapor cigarettes lowered adjusted operating income (excluding litigation and other extraordinary expenses) by 1.4% to $555 million. The adjusted operating margin narrowed to 34.4% from 36.6%. The good news included increased market share for all four of the company’s key brands, including Camel, Pall Mall, Grizzly and Natural American Spirit. American Electric Power Co. AEP, -0.10%  of Columbus, Ohio, generates electricity and operates a regulated utility servicing 3.5 million customers in 11 states. The stock returned 22% to $55.77, and has a dividend yield of 3.59%. Please see 10 laggard stocks that could get a huge M&A premium for coverage of the remarkable runup of electric utility stocks this year. American Campus Communities Inc. ACC, +0.13%  of Austin, Texas, is a real estate investment trust that mainly owns and manages student housing. The stock returned 21% to close at $38.24. The REIT pays a quarterly dividend of 38 cents for a yield of 3.97%. Because of their focus on cash flow, equity REITs report funds from operations (FFO) in addition to GAAP earnings. Revenue for the first quarter rose 12% from a year earlier to $183.2 million, while FFO increased to $73.8 million, or 69 cents a share, from $68.5 million, or 64 cents. Plains All American Pipeline L.P. PAA, +1.94%  of Houston operates crude oil, natural gas and refined product pipelines in the U.S. and Canada. The stock returned 19% to $60.05. There are several energy limited partnerships listed here, and for convenience we’re referring to limited partnership units as “shares.” For more on the tax advantages and reporting requirements for LP investments, as well as the potential for high income, please see five dividend stocks with yields up to 10%. Plains All American shares have a yield of 4.20%. American Water Works Co. AWK, +1.16%  of Voorhees, N.J., provides water and wastewater services through a regulated segment that serves customers in 16 states, and through a market operations segment that builds and maintains facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and corporate customers. The stock returned 19% to $49.45, and has a dividend yield of 2.51%. First-quarter earnings were $68.1 million, or 38 cents a share, increasing from $57.6 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier. But if expenses from a chemical spill in West Virginia were excluded, net income would have been $71.7 million, or 40 cents. Murphy USA Inc. MUSA, +1.11%  of El Dorado, Ark., is a refiner that also runs over 1,200 gas stations in the country. The company was spun off from Murphy Oil Corp. MUR, +1.85%  last year. Murphy USA’s stock returned 18% at $48.89. The company reported a 4% year-over-year decline in first-quarter revenue to $4.16 billion, reflecting “a challenging wholesale environment.” But Murphy USA’s convenience stores showed much better results, as non-tobacco sales grew 5.3%, and the margin on these products increased by 10%. Net income was $9.6 million, or 21 cents a share, down from $22 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier. American States Water Co. AWR, +1.03%  of San Dimas, Calif., provides water and wastewater utility services in 10 California counties and has a smaller electricity utility business and a contract business that operates water systems at military installations. The stock returned 17% in the first half, closing at $33.23. The company last month announced an increase in its quarterly dividend, and the shares now yield 2.56%. First-quarter operating revenue was down 8% to $101.9 million, mainly because of a 32% drop in contracted services revenue, which had been expected as projects at two bases were completed. The company expects contract revenue to increase over the rest of the year. Net income was $11 million, or 28 cents a share, down from $13.5 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier. Cash America International Inc. US:CSH  of Forth Worth, Texas, operates over 800 pawn shops in the nation, most of which offer consumer-lending services as well. The company has nearly 50 foreign locations. The stock returned 16%, closing at $44.43 on Monday. Cash America’s first-quarter earnings grew to $45.7 million, or $1.55 a share, from $43.9 million, or $1.40, a year earlier. U.S. Energy Corp. USEG, +0.64%  of Riverton, Wyo., has various oil and gas production properties in the U.S. The stock returned 15% to $4.33. First-quarter revenue totaled $8.3 million, up 5% from a year earlier, as oil and gas sales increased. Net income was $250,000, or a penny a share, improving from a net loss of $5.9 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier. Packaging Corp. of America PKG, +1.37%  of Lake Forest, Ill., provides paper and corrugated packaging used in various industries. The company also sells newsprint to publishers. The stock returned 14% to $71.49, and has a dividend yield of 2.24%. First-quarter net sales were up 90% to $1.43 billion, which included the acquisition of Boise Inc. Earnings came in at $90 million, or 92 cents a share, increasing from $62 million, or 64 cents, during the first quarter of 2013. A lawsuit settlement and integration costs lowered profits by $16 million. American Tower Corp. AMT, +0.72%  of Boston is a real estate investment trust focusing on acquiring and leasing land used for wireless and broadcast operations. The stock returned 14% to $89.98, and has a dividend yield of 1.51%. The REIT reported a 23% year-over-year increase in first-quarter revenue to $984.1 million, while adjusted funds from operations (FFO) were up 21% to $493.3 million. Alon USA Partners LP US:ALDW  of Dallas is a subsidiary of Alon USA Energy Inc. US:ALJ that completed its initial public offering in November 2012. The main business of the partnership is to operate a crude oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas. The shares returned 14% to close at $17.93. The partnership makes a variable quarterly distribution, so it can be volatile. Total distributions based on 2013 operations came to $2.37 a share. Net income was $42.2 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $93.5 million, or $1.50, a year earlier. The results show the vagaries of the market for refined fuel. The first-quarter operating margin was $14.77 per barrel, about half that of a year earlier. Aqua America Inc. WTR, +1.40%  of Bryn Mawr, Pa., is the third water utility on this list, with operations in eight states. The shares returned 12.5% to $26.22, and have a dividend yield of 2.32%. The company reported a 2% increase in first-quarter operating revenue to $182.7 million amid “one of the toughest winters in decades.” Net income was $42.9 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $46.6 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Primerica Inc. PRI, -0.31%  of Duluth, Ga., is a life-insurance company that distributes financial products in the U.S. and Canada. The stock returned 12% to $47.85. That followed a 45% return during 2013, which was a very strong recovery year for the life-insurance sector, as investors anticipated an eventual rise in interest rates. First-quarter operating revenue rose 9% to $324 million, while net income increased to $45.1 million, or 81 cents a share, from $38.8 million, or 65 cents, a year earlier. Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings LH, +0.14%  of Burlington, N.C. — better known as LabCorp — operates clinical laboratories and provides services at 1,700 patient centers worldwide. The stock returned 12% to $102.40. LabCorp reported first-quarter earnings of $113.5 million, or $1.31 a share, down from $147.2 million, or $1.56, a year earlier, hurt by severe winter weather. Sales were down 1% to $1.431 billion. Despite the difficult first quarter, LabCorp raised its guidance for 2014. American Assets Trust Inc. AAT, -1.99%  of San Diego is a REIT that acquires and develops commercial and multifamily property mainly in California and Hawaii. The stock returned 11% to close at $34.55, and the dividend yield is 2.55%.

ACC,"Our research on insider trading patterns has concluded that stocks bought by insiders tend to outperform the market following these purchases, particularly if multiple insiders are buying (read our analysis of studies on consensus insider purchases). We're also big believers that small cap stocks are more likely to be mispriced than larger companies which receive constant attention from the financial media and from large institutional investors such as mutual funds. As a result, we like to treat multiple insider purchases similarly to a stock screen- as a signal that a company may be worth taking at least a brief look at to decide whether or not it might be undervalued and therefore worthy of further analysis. Here are five stocks with market capitalizations between $1 billion and $5 billion which multiple insiders have bought recently: Multiple insiders were buying shares of real estate developer Howard Hughes HHC, +2.05% signaling that they believe that real estate markets will continue to recover. Last quarter Howard Hughes delivered over a 60% increase in revenue compared with the second quarter of 2012, roughly matching the rate at which the stock price has risen in the last year; operating income has surged as well. Wall Street analysts expect $3.37 in earnings per share in 2014, making for a forward earnings multiple of 31. In addition to insider trading activity, we also track quarterly 13F filings from hedge funds and other notable investors. We've found that, on average, the most popular small cap stocks among hedge funds achieve an average excess return of 18 percentage points per year; putting this theory into practice, last summer we launched a small cap portfolio following this strategy which has since outperformed the S&P 500 by 29 percentage points. Learn more about our small cap strategy. We can also use our database to track hedge fund interest in individual stocks. For example, billionaire Bill Ackman's Pershing Square owned 3.6 million shares of Howard Hughes last quarter. James Litinsky, John Paulson, and Julian Robertson are among HHC shareholders as well. Oil and gas exploration and production company Halcon Resources HK, +0.62% focused on shale fields in the onshore U.S., is down 41% in the last year and still has 17% of its float held short. A number of insiders have reacted to this bearishness by buying the stock. Production has been up in percentage terms, but Halcon is still depending on further increases in order to hit sell-side targets for next year. If the company does meet analyst forecasts, then the forward P/E would be only 15 and so we'd be interested in following further results from the company. American Campus Communities ACC, +0.13% a real-estate investment trust which invests in student housing properties, also meets our criteria of multiple insiders buying the stock within the last month. Because real-estate investment trusts must distribute a large share of taxable income to shareholders in order to preserve their favorable tax treatment, they often pay high yields; American Campus Communities is no exception with an annual yield of 4.3%. We'd note that the stock has dropped nearly 30% year to date. Highbridge Capital Management, founded by billionaire Glenn Dubin, was buying the stock last quarter. Another real-estate investment trust which insiders are excited about is Healthcare Trust of America HTA, +0.57% which as might be implied from the name invests in health care related real estate such as medical office buildings. With quarterly dividend payments of 14.4 cents per share, the yield is 5.6% at current prices. In statistical terms, Healthcare Trust of America has a fairly low beta- of 0.4- and it does make some sense that health care related real estate would be less sensitive to changes in the overall economy than residential or general commercial. Jacob Gottlieb has a large position in the stock. Finishing off our list of small caps with multiple insiders buying recently is $2.7 billion market cap aerospace equipment manufacturer Woodward WWD, +0.96% In its most recent quarter, Woodward's sales grew by 5% compared with the same period in the previous fiscal year but this was offset by higher costs; as a result, pretax income was down slightly. Woodward carries trailing and forward earnings multiples of 20 and 16, respectively, and so markets seem to have priced in expectations that business will grow moderately over the next few years.

ACC,"Suzan Kaplan/MarketWatch Houses such as these in Alameda, Calif. are getting interest from bargain-minded buyers, but investors may do better with shares of publicly traded apartment managers. CHICAGO (MarketWatch) — Now may be a great time to buy a house, given that years of falling home prices and low mortgage rates have made buying a place to live more affordable than it has been in decades. And that’s not just a pitch from the National Association of Realtors. A recent report from J.P. Morgan Asset Management, titled “Housing: A time to buy,” written by David Kelly and David Lebovitz, made the case for why a home may be a wise purchase. Read more: Mortgage rates plunge beyond expectations. Where to Invest in Real Estate “Although the U.S. housing market remains extremely depressed, we believe that given current valuations and demographic dynamics, now may be the time to consider an investment in housing,” the report said. Investors may be tempted to play off that theme, positioning themselves for the moment when home buyers come back in droves. But that’s a trickier proposition than it sounds. This housing market has been anything but predictable. And the pain inflicted during the housing recession has left deep scars, making it difficult for many people to pin their money to the belief that housing could soon be on the mend. Plus, any recovery may be slow. That’s because while prices are down and financing is attractive, it’s harder for people to qualify for mortgages. The high unemployment rate has dealt a blow to household formation, and other would-be buyers simply can’t muster the confidence to buy a home. Moreover, many homeowners are underwater on their mortgage and won’t be able to sell their home, let alone buy a new one, anytime soon. Read more: Why you can't get the lowest mortgage rates. INVESTING COMMENTARY IN TRADING DECK Back to 1987 for stocks? Our Trading Deck has been home to a spirited debate over whether we're in for a crash. • L.A. Little: Don't worry | Michael Gayed: Worry • The warning signs of a 1987-style crash • Hulbert: Stocks as overvalued as at 2007 high “My own read of the tea leaves is [a housing recovery is] going to take awhile, and there isn’t an obvious place to invest to play that theme,” said Craig Leupold, president of Green Street Advisors, a real-estate and real-estate investment trust research firm. Home, sweet home Any brave souls willing to make a bet on the return of the residential real-estate market right now might first look at home builders and the home-improvement stores as places to invest. Builders have slashed volume in recent years, and are on track to sell 313,000 new homes this year — far fewer than in 2005, when 1.28 million new homes were sold. In fact, builders have pulled so far back on creating inventory during the downturn, it’s possible the market could run out of existing inventory faster than expected once housing gets back on track, said Eric Landry, director of industrial sector research for investment research firm Morningstar Inc. Read more: New U.S. home sales rise as prices tumble. “When the confidence does arise, there’s not going to be enough supply to satiate it,” he said. After all, he noted, the population keeps growing and our housing stock isn’t growing with it. Plus, he said, new buyers will want houses that are near job centers and are built for modern lifestyles, and some currently available houses won’t fit that bill. Read more: Why would you buy a new home? Some of these home builder stocks come cheap: Compare the current stock price of publicly traded builders PulteGroup Inc. PHM, +1.41%  and KB Home KBH, +2.60%  with their prices five years ago. Each stock trades at about 85% below its five-year high, with Pulte’s shares down 29% annualized over that period and KB Home shares off 27% a year, according to Morningstar. A weak remodeling market is predicted to last through the first half of 2012, according to the Remodeling Futures Program at the Joint Center for Housing Studies of Harvard University. But once buying ticks up, expect home-improvement sales to follow — and that’s good news for companies such as Home Depot HD, +1.99%  and Lowe’s LOW, +2.18%  , since homeowners tend to make improvements either just before they sell or right after they buy. Other investment vehicles worth considering in a housing turnaround: publicly traded real-estate investment trusts, along with real estate-sector mutual funds and index-tracking exchange-traded funds. The average real-estate mutual fund is up about 5% so far this year through Nov. 2, versus a flat performance for the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index SPX, +1.38%  , according to Morningstar. The researcher’s analysts single out two real-estate mutual funds: JPMorgan US Real Estate SUSIX, +1.48% up 6%, and T. Rowe Price Real Estate, TRREX, -0.15% which has gained 7.5%. Since a housing rebound would likely accompany a broad economic improvement — and increased consumer confidence — retail REITs also may be worth a look, said Green Street Advisors’ Leupold. Read more: 5 real-estate funds to house in your portfolio. Retail, particularly large shopping centers, is a key investment theme for Marty Cohen, co-CEO of real-estate mutual fund manager Cohen & Steers Inc. CNS, -0.15%   “Despite a very slow growth economy, retail sales have been pretty strong, and the numbers coming out of the regional mall companies have been exceptional,” Cohen said. He pointed to “very few bankruptcies of their tenants; same-store sales in the mid-single-digit growth, and their earnings are coming in very nicely.”Watch: Where to invest in real estate. Higher-end malls are especially attractive because affluent consumers haven’t cut back as much on spending, added George Hunt, who heads equity REIT research at Wells Fargo Wealth Management. In contrast, he said, strip malls aren’t quite as appealing since the small businesses that surround the anchor tenants have been hit so hard by the recession. At KeyBanc Capital Markets, REIT analyst Todd Thomas recommends three shopping center operators: Acadia Realty Trust AKR, -0.77% ; Glimcher Realty Trust GRT, -3.95%  and Ramco-Gershenson Properties Trust RPT, -0.96%   Rooms with a view If you think that housing sales will remain low, your best bet might be to snap up rentals at low prices. Those with wherewithal and patience might invest in a low-priced property and turn it into a rental, which can be a lucrative move at a time when rents are on the rise because fewer people have the means — or the desire — to buy a home.Read more: Why investing in rentals could be a good move. Some firms help the novice investor buy an income-producing single-family home and offer property-management support. These companies buy single-family home foreclosures, update them to new construction standards, find quality tenants, and sell the income-producing properties to investors. “It’s geared toward your business owners and professionals who want to diversify their portfolio of investments and want to get benefits that come along with owning real estate,” said Eric Workman, vice president of sales for MACK Companies, which is based in the Chicago area. “Owning real estate without having someone else manage it for you becomes a full-time job,” he said. Another, more liquid, option is to invest in apartment REITs. They’ll suffer if there’s a strong return to homeownership, but the sector should be solid for at least another 18 months, said Wells Fargo’s Hunt. One big reason to look at apartments: Supply is at a 30-year low, and for every percentage point that the homeownership rate drops, another 1.1 million renters enter the market, Hunt said. Plus, many 18- to 32-year-olds may still be wary of homeownership, since for the past several years all they’ve seen is home prices going down, Hunt added. And this is a generation that isn’t as secure as they’d like to be in their jobs, he said, so not being tied down to a mortgage will likely be important to them.

ACC,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Among the stocks that could see active trade in Thursday’s session are Research In Motion Ltd., Rockwell Collins Inc. and Transcept Pharmaceuticals Inc. Along with BlackBerry maker RIM RIMM a handful of companies are scheduled to report earnings, including Pier 1 Imports Inc. PIR, +2.88% Marcus Corp. MCS, +0.50% AAR Corp. AIR, +1.36%  and Diamond Foods Inc. DMND among others. Late Wednesday, Standard & Poor’s said American Campus Communities Inc. ACC, +0.13%  will be added to the S&P MidCap 400 index after the close of trading on Sept. 16, taking the place of Lubrizol Corp. LZ  as Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, +1.43% BRK.A, +1.04%  closes on its acquisition. Transcept Pharmaceuticals TSPT  said it plans to resubmit to the Food and Drug Administration a new drug application for its candidate known as Intermezzo. The company’s seeking approval of Intermezzo for use as needed to treat of insomnia, when a middle-of-the-night awakening is followed by difficulty returning to sleep. FDA officials, Transcept said, agreed with the company’s proposal to reduce the recommended dose to 1.75 milligrams from 3.5 mg for women, and to keep the dose for men at 3.5 mg. The resubmitted application should be made by the end of September, the Point Richmond, Calif.-based company said. Rio Tinto RIO, +2.65%  said it’s priced $2 billion of fixed-rate debt securities: $500 million of notes due September 2016 and paying a coupon of 2.2%; $1.15 billion of notes due 2012 paying a coupon of 3.75%; and $350 million of 5.2% notes due November 2040. The bonds issued by Rio Tinto Finance (USA) Ltd. will be fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Rio Tinto PLC (RIO) and Rio Tinto Ltd. (RIO), the mining and resources company said. The board of Rockwell Collins COL, -0.33%  increased the company’s share-repurchase authorization by $700 million, as a way to speed up growth in earnings. The company made the buyback announcement late Wednesday as it laid out financial targets for fiscal 2012: earnings in a range of $4.40 to $4.60 a share with revenue of between $4.9 billion and $5 billion. Rockwell Collins also affirmed that it expects earnings from continuing operations of $4 to $4.10 a share and revenue of $4.8 billion to $4.85 billion for the fiscal year ending in September, a forecast that excludes the company gain on sale of Rollmet as well as any impact from potential restructuring actions. Pall Corp. PLL, -6.21%  said it expects to generate adjusted earnings in a range of $3.07 to $3.32 a share for fiscal 2012. This compares to adjusted earnings of $2.77 a share for the fiscal year ended July 31 and $2.12 a share for fiscal 2010. Currency translations accounted for 13 cents a share of earnings for fiscal 2011; the company pegged currency as adding an estimated 2 cents a share to its profit for fiscal 2012. Along with reporting financial results for the third quarter ended Aug. 27, Clarcor Inc. CLC, +6.25%  affirmed its projected full-year earnings target of $2.25 to $2.40 a share. “We expect to be in the upper end of this range assuming there are no major economic disruptions in the fourth quarter,” said CEO Norm Johnson. However, “we enter the fourth quarter with some caution,” he said, noting the economic question marks hanging over the U.S., Europe and China. Ascena Retail Group Inc. ASNA, -3.83% along with reporting results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended July 30, forecast earnings in a range of $2.55 to $2.65 a share for fiscal 2012.

ACC,"CHICAGO (MarketWatch) — The housing market is still in the tank and doesn’t seem likely to emerge anytime soon, but there are investment opportunities in one segment: student housing. It’s not a risk-free proposition and it’s far more management intensive than conventional multifamily property. But student housing has a long history of growth and stability and as college enrollment stays on its upward trajectory, promises to repeat the pattern. “Demand and supply conditions for housing are bad,” said David Stiff, chief economist with Fiserv, which publishes the Case-Shiller Home Price Index. “But in college towns demand conditions are slightly better. There’s a stable source of new demand every year.”   Luxury golf communities' home values are falling, done in by rampant overdevelopment, the economic downturn and waning interest in the sport.

ACC, +0.13% and Education Realty Trust Inc. EDR, -0.24% An initial public offering is on deck for a third, Campus Crest Communities Inc., which expects to list on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “CCG.” Head of the class REITs focused on student housing in recent years have become investment magnets for large pension funds. Some bigger syndicates have partnerships with larger funds. Campus Advantage Inc., among the nation’s largest private student-housing companies, for example, is managing and helping to develop properties for Calpers, the California Public Employees Retirement System. “Comparable to other similar product-type investment opportunities, student housing is a really good investment,” said Michael Orsak, vice president at Campus Advantage, which manages and owns 50 properties across the U.S., mostly in the Southeast, Midwest and Texas. The industry measures its size based on beds. For Campus Advantage, that translates into 30,000 beds. “These investments return pretty stable cash-on-cash yields going in and should continue to hold up in the long term vs. other similar product types that might have larger peaks and troughs in occupancy and rental-rate growth,” he added. Orsak said most institutions can expect a cash-on-cash yield in year one at 8% to 9%. “I don’t know where a pension fund can find that today in the stock market or bonds,” he said. Though markets differ by campus — large public universities have steady enrollment; smaller so-called tier three schools are growing exponentially — the national statistics on enrollment are strong. In 2010, a record 19.1 million students were enrolled in two-year and four-year colleges and universities, a 25% jump since 2000, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. That underscores a consistent uptick in enrollment that is expected to continue — albeit at a slower pace — until at least 2018 as the last of the Baby Boomer’s children reach college age. Coupled with the recession, which has prompted many to go back to school for second and advanced degrees, enrollment in post-secondary schools has rarely been so robust. Moreover, today’s students aren’t living in the kind of housing their parents once inhabited. Many are leaving a home where they had their own bedroom and bathroom, a separate family or media room and amenities either at home or nearby. They expect the same when they leave campus — and parents appear willing to pay for it. Campus Crest, which owns and manages 27 properties, or 13,580 beds, boasts of its amenities in its initial public offering prospectus. All of its properties — which, like Campus Advantage and ACC, are considered Class A — offer what Campus Crest calls “bed-bath parity” or private bathrooms for each student.

ACC,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Saxon REIT priced near the top of its range for its stock market debut Tuesday as a busy week for initial public offerings gets under way. Saxon REIT SAXND opened at $23.55, above its $22.75 price. The stock fell to $23.15 in afternoon action. The company offered 17 million shares at $22.75 to raise $387 million. To stoke interest in the deal, Saxon cut the size of the offering by one million shares. The move apparently worked, as Saxon priced near the top of its $21 to $23 estimated range with underwriter Friedman Billings Ramsey. The company will assume the ticker symbol of Saxon Capital ""SAXN"" but is first trading under ""SAXND"" before it converts to a real-estate investment trust. Saxon is the latest in a series of REIT IPOs that have debuted this year. Already operating as a subprime-mortgage originator, Saxon will become a REIT while holding onto its core business. The money raised in the deal will help finance a mortgage investment pool to pay dividends under the REIT structure. Saxon's wholesale mortgage business purchases loans through a network of about 4,000 independent brokers throughout the country. Its retail channel, America's MoneyLine Inc., originates mortgage loans directly to borrowers through a retail branch network with 25 locations with required state licenses. The company expects to be treated as a REIT by the end of the year. ""We expect our new structure to afford us the flexibility to continue to originate, purchase, sell and service loans and conduct other mortgage banking activities through our taxable REIT subsidiaries, as well,"" the company said. Doug Naidus, chief executive of MortgageIT MHL, -5.90% which has a similar structure, said that setting up a taxable REIT subsidiary will allow Saxon to retain much more of its after-tax income. Wall Street likes such deals because they offer tax advantages and faster growth potential than a traditional REIT, added Naidus, who brought his company public during the summer. The outlook for real-estate investment trusts remains positive--at least in the short-term, according to Naidus--even if the Federal Reserve Bank raises interest rates by a quarter-percentage point this week and another quarter point by the end of the year, as expected. Several REITs have gone public this year, amid low interest rates and healthy refinancing activity, including HomeBanc HMB, -0.35% Kite Realty Trust KRG, -1.04% Extra Space Storage EXR, +0.00% BioMed Realty Trust BMR, -7.32% and American Campus ACC, +0.13% Elsewhere in the IPO market, Renaissance Capital tapped Beacon Roofing as its offering of the week, as several deals step up to the plate.

ACC,"BOSTON, Feb 08, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Northeastern University administration, American Campus Communities ACC, +0.13% City of Boston officials, members of the Roxbury, Mission Hill and Fenway neighborhoods, the project development team and Boston workers joined together yesterday in a topping out and beam signing ceremony to celebrate the structural completion milestone on the 825-bed, on-campus, modern student apartment community. This project represents the first successful project to begin construction in the city of Boston under the Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s initiative Housing A Changing City: 2030 that includes the improvement of student housing throughout the city. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180208006314/en/ In 2014, the City of Boston outlined an initiative that includes improving the quality and quantity of student housing for Boston college and university students that will in turn open up existing housing currently occupied by students for the Boston workforce. The goal is to create 16,000 new undergraduate student dorm beds, reducing the number of students living off-campus in Boston by 50 percent. The public-private partnership between Northeastern University and American Campus Communities is an important step in the realization of this goal. “I want to thank Northeastern and American Campus Communities for living up to our challenge to create more housing for students in Boston,” said Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “When complete, this new dorm will provide students with quality living spaces, while returning important housing stock to the private market for Boston residents. Working with our partners in academia we are confident that we will be able to keep the dialogue open and build more dorms for undergraduate and graduate students alike.” Upon its delivery in Fall 2019, the $153.4 million community will be located on the Northeastern University campus. The community will feature nearly 12,000 square feet of interior amenity and common area space, including social and recreational lounges, a state-of-the-art fitness center, Academic Success Center, and 2,200 square feet of vibrant retail. The design and development process included student focus groups and robust community involvement to ensure all stakeholders had input to facilitate project success. “This is a project that is opening our community and our university to innovation, to education, and to jobs. And that is why we are very happy and why we are excited,” said Northeastern President Joseph E. Aoun. “The building is not the destination, the people are the destination, and the people in our community are going to benefit tremendously from this.” Northeastern is a global research university that pushes learning and discovery far beyond the boundaries of classroom and campus. The university is the recognized leader in experiential learning, powered by the world’s most far-reaching and innovative cooperative education program, offering students opportunities for professional work, research, service, and global learning with more than 3,000 employers in 136 countries. “As the first developer-led student housing project in the city of Boston, we’re excited to work with Northeastern University, one of the nation’s most prestigious universities, in support of Boston’s leadership to address the need for live-learn, purpose-built residential environments for students,” said Bill Bayless, American Campus Communities CEO. “This student community marks the beginning of what we hope will be a highly successful partnership, and a true win for Northeastern University, its students and the City of Boston.” The transaction was structured under the American Campus Equity (ACE) [®] program, which gives universities the opportunity to expand and modernize their student housing portfolio without the use of university financial resources. Under the ACE program, ACC delivers high-quality student housing at lower development costs and operating expenses as well as affordable rents to residents, without the use of taxpayer or university funds, which allows universities to dedicate their capital to educational and research facilities.

ACC,"Jan 31, 2018 (ACCESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- LONDON, UK / ACCESSWIRE / January 31, 2018 / Active-Investors has a free review on American Campus Communities, Inc. ACC, +0.13% following the Company's announcement that it will begin trading ex-dividend on February 01, 2018. In order to capture the dividend payout, investors must purchase the stock a day prior to the ex-dividend date that is by latest at the end of the trading session on January 31, 2018.

All you need to do is sign up for your free membership at: www.active-investors.com/registration-sg Dividend Declared On January 23, 2018, American Campus Communities, announced that its Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.44 per share of common stock, payable on February 16, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business on February 02, 2018. American Campus Communities' indicated dividend represents a yield of 4.48%, which is substantially higher than the average dividend yield of 4.25% for the financial sector. The Company has raised dividend for five years in a row. Dividend Insights American Campus Communities has a dividend payout ratio of 76.2%, which denotes that the Company distributes approximately $0.76 for every $1.00 earned. The dividend payout ratio reflects how much amount a company is returning to shareholders versus how much money it is keeping on hand to reinvest in growth, to pay off debt, and/or to add to its cash reserves. According to analysts' estimates, American Campus Communities is forecasted to report earnings of $0.72 per share for the next year compared to the Company's annualized dividend of $1.76 per share. One of the primary reasons for the difference between earnings and annualized dividend is that American Campus Communities is a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) which is structured by law to distribute at least 90% of earnings. Moreover, since REITs generate income from owning portfolios of investment real estate, they are likely to have higher depreciation charges. Since depreciation is a non-cash charge, it does not directly impact the ability of dividend the companies can distribute. For this reason, Fund from Operations (FFO) is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization to earnings and subtracting any gains on sales which then provides a better picture of any company's profitability and capacity to pay and to sustain dividends. For instance, for the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, American Campus Communities reported net loss attributable to the Company of $1.3 million, or $0.01 per fully diluted share, versus net income of $9.6 million, or $0.07 per fully diluted share, in Q3 2016. On the other hand, American Campus Communities reported quarterly FFO-Modified (FFOM) per share of $0.44 per fully diluted share, or $61.2 million, for Q3 2017 versus $0.45 per fully diluted share, or $60.4 million, for Q3 2016. The FFO number indicates that the Company should be able to comfortably cover its dividend payout. Recent Development for American Campus Communities On January 12, 2018, American Campus Communities announced that the Company's project, The Summit at University City, received the National Association of Home Builders' (NAHB) 2017 Multifamily Pillars of the Industry Award for Best Student Housing Rental Apartment Community. The Company's projects were also recognized as finalists for Best Example of Green Building Concepts, Best Student Housing Rental Apartment Community, and Best Mixed-Use Community. American Campus Communities has been recognized at NAHB's Pillars of the Industry Awards on 28 occasions since 2005, 14 of which are first place awards, including the Multifamily Development Firm of the Year in 2013.

The development was designed by Chicago-based SCB architects. “This new facility will revitalize campus housing and provide much-needed amenities to our students,” said UIC Chancellor Michael Amiridis. “By creating innovative public-private partnerships we are able to address our capital infrastructure needs in the current fiscal environment.” By the time the building is finished in July of 2019, it will hold 83,000 square feet of residence space, housing 550 beds in a mix of traditional dorm rooms and suite-style units. Currently, there are nine dorms on the UIC campus, the last built in 2007. In addition, the building will house 16,000 square feet of shared spaces including lounges for studying and student interaction, offices, laundry rooms, a fitness center, a 10th-floor sky lounge, as well as 1,600 square feet of retail space expected to house a coffee shop. The plans also call for 51,000 square feet of academic space in the structure, including three large lecture halls, four classrooms, several small group study rooms, a tutoring center, computer stations and collaboration spaces. “The new Academic and Residential Complex will give our students a place where they can engage and interact with their peers in an inviting, welcoming environment in the heart of Chicago and the West Loop neighborhood,” said Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs J. Rex Tolliver. “Enhancing the student experience is one of our top priorities and it’s what makes UIC a first-rate option for students and their families.” “UIC is a forward-thinking educational institution, fiercely pursuing its mission set forth by Chancellor Amiridis to provide an innovative residential experience for its students,” said Jamie Wilhelm, American Campus Communities executive vice president of public-private partnerships. “We’re thrilled to partner with UIC to bring one of the leading mixed-use student developments in the country to fruition.” The project is part of a new decade-long master plan to bolster the physical development of UIC. The plan is in the final stage of development and addresses the university’s capital infrastructure needs as total enrollment – including graduate and professional students – continues to grow, exceeding 30,500 students this fall for the first time in UIC’s history. Undergraduate students also showed an 8.3 percent increase from 2016 figures, including a 23 percent increase in new freshmen. To meet the needs of the increasing number of students enrolled in engineering and computer science programs, UIC also broke ground in November for a 50,000-square-foot Engineering Innovation Building that will house instructional space, research labs and staff offices. It will also include the university’s first high-bay structural research lab where researchers can perform tests on large-scale structures. The building, near Taylor and Morgan streets, will concentrate the College of Engineering in one area on the east side of campus by the fall of 2019. It will provide room for the chemical, mechanical and industrial engineering, as well as the civil and materials engineering departments. Additional infrastructure projects are in the planning phase and will be presented as part of the overall master plan later this spring.

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20171130006271/en/ Now in its 31st year, the Entrepreneur Of The Year Award recognizes leaders and visionaries who demonstrate excellence and extraordinary success in innovation, financial performance and personal commitment to building world-class businesses and supporting their communities. The Entrepreneur Of The Year [®]  winners are chosen from an independent panel of judges including entrepreneurs and prominent leaders from business, finance, and local community leaders. As the first and only truly global awards program of its kind, Entrepreneur Of The Year celebrates those who are building and leading successful, growing and dynamic businesses, recognizing them through regional, national and global awards programs in more than 145 cities in more than 60 countries. Bayless forged his vision of what would someday become American Campus Communities while he was still a student at WVU working as a dishwasher, grill cook, night desk attendant, and as a resident assistant at Summit Hall. In 1993, the 29-year-old Bayless co-founded American Campus Communities with an ambitious mission to improve housing and the quality of life for students. In 2004, he led the student housing industry to a new plateau when ACC successfully consummated its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange, becoming the first publicly-traded student housing company in the nation and introducing the sector to Wall Street and institutional investors. Today, ACC has a team of 3,200 nationwide with 350 located at the home office in Austin, Texas. American Campus Communities provides modern, academically oriented student communities to nearly 130,000 students at more than 90 colleges and universities across the country. His vision, passion, and tenacious determination have not only fueled the success and prominence of American Campus Communities but have also served as a catalyst for the entire student housing industry becoming a well-respected asset class within the commercial real estate sector. “Once again, the hard work and success of the American Campus Communities team have resulted in personal accolades,” Bayless said. “I am humbled and honored by this recognition and am thrilled that the entrepreneurial spirit of hard work, innovation and pursuing your passion thrives at our company. The timing of this honor is truly special as we are about to embark on our 25 [th]  anniversary. The ACC team’s commitment and dedication to put students first continues to inspire me to further build on the mission we set upon in 1993.” Other Texas-based companies were recognized for innovation in their own Entrepreneur Of The Year categories, including: About American Campus Communities American Campus Communities, Inc. is the largest owner, manager and developer of high-quality student housing communities in the United States.

The grand opening event was held at Skyview and featured a ribbon cutting ceremony and reception.

The Company's revenue beat analysts' expectations of $180.43 million. During Q3 2017, ACC's operating income came in at $17.6 million versus $29.3 million in Q3 2016. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to a $9.1 million increase in depreciation and amortization, $2.9 million in property acquisition costs related to the Core Spaces Portfolio acquisition, and $1.9 million in expenses associated with Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. ACC's net loss totaled $1.3 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for Q3 2017 compared to net income of $9.6 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for Q3 2016. The Company's FFO was $59.0 million, or $0.43 per fully diluted share, for the reported quarter compared to $61.1 million, or $0.46 per fully diluted share, for the year-ago same period. For Q3 2017, ACC's FFOM was $61.2 million, or $0.44 per fully diluted share, compared to $60.4 million, or $0.45 per fully diluted share, for Q3 2016. The Company's reported number fell short of Wall Street's estimates of $0.46 per diluted share. Operating Results During Q3 2017, ACC's net operating income (NOI) for same store wholly-owned properties was $74.9 million, reflecting a decrease of 0.8% from $75.5 million in Q3 2016. The Company's same store wholly-owned property revenues increased by 1.3% on a y-o-y basis due primarily to an increase in average rental rates for the 2017-2018 academic year. For Q3 2017, ACC's same store wholly-owned property operating expenses increased by 3.3% on a y-o-y basis. NOI for the total wholly-owned portfolio decreased 1.2% to $84.9 million in the reported quarter from $85.9 million in the year-earlier same quarter, primarily due to the sale of 20 non-core properties since Q2 2016. Portfolio Update Developments - During Q3 2017, ACC completed construction and delivered $609.2 million of owned development assets into service. As of September 30, 2017, these properties were 83.2% occupied. The Company also progressed with the construction of its $603.3 million development and $282.6 million presale development pipeline with expected delivery in Fall 2018 and Fall 2019. American Campus Equity (ACE) - During the reported quarter, the Company made further advancements in its ACE development program, executing a pre-development agreement for a second phase project on the University of Southern California Health Sciences campus in Los Angeles. The proposed $42.0 million second-phase project includes approximately 300 beds, expanding on the highly successful initial ACE development which was 99.6% occupied as of September 30, 2017, and is currently over 100% applied for the academic year 2018-2019. Acquisitions - During Q3 2017, ACC entered into an agreement to recapitalize and ultimately acquire seven select student housing properties totaling 3,776 beds for $590.6 million from affiliates of Core Spaces and DRW Real Estate Investments. The transaction included the acquisition of two existing communities, two communities opened in Fall 2017 and three presale development projects scheduled for completion in Fall 2018. Third-Party Services - During Q3 2017, ACC completed construction and commenced management of Momentum Village Phase II and Esperanza Hall, 560-bed and 382-bed third-party development projects located on the campuses of Texas A&M University. Also during the reported quarter, the Company closed on financing and commenced construction on a third-party on-campus development project with the University of California, Irvine. The 1,441-bed student housing development project represents the fourth phase of the Company's partnership with the university, including more than 6,500 modern student beds in purpose-built, academically oriented student communities totaling more than $550 million of total project cost. Capital Markets - In September 2017, ACC entered into a $300 million senior unsecured term loan, which matures in September 2018. The loan contains two one-year extension options and an accordion feature that allows the Company to expand the facility by up to an additional $100 million. Proceeds were used to pay down the outstanding balance on the company's revolving credit facility. At-The-Market (ATM) Share Offering Program - In July 2017, ACC sold 24,000 shares of common stock at a weighted average price of $48.09 per share for net proceeds of approximately $1.1 million.
