Our results of operations and cash flows should be read in conjunction with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report and the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Forward-Looking Statements This Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q contains forward-looking statements which are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Statements contained in this report, other than statements of historical fact, constitute ""forward-looking statements."" The words ""expects,"" ""believes,"" ""hopes,"" ""anticipates,"" ""estimates,"" ""may,"" ""could,"" ""intends,"" ""exploring,"" ""evaluating,"" ""progressing,"" ""proceeding"" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements do not constitute guarantees of future performance. Investors are cautioned that statements which are not strictly historical statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding current or future financial payments, costs, returns, royalties, performance and position, plans and objectives for future operations, plans and objectives for product development, plans and objectives for present and future clinical trials and results of such trials, plans and objectives for regulatory approval, litigation, intellectual property, product development, manufacturing plans and performance, management's initiatives and strategies, and the development of Opexa's product candidates, including Tcelna (imilecleucel-T) and OPX-212, constitute forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, those risks discussed in ""Risk Factors,"" as well as, without limitation, risks associated with: ? the strategies, prospects, plans, expectations and objectives of management of Opexa or Acer Therapeutics, Inc. (""Acer"") for future operations of the combined company, including the execution of integration and restructuring plans and the anticipated timing of filings; These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date made. We assume no obligation or undertaking to update any forward-looking statements to reflect any changes in expectations with regard thereto or any change in events, conditions or circumstances on which any such statement is based. You should, however, review additional disclosures we make in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and Current Reports on Form 8-K filed with the SEC. Overview Unless otherwise indicated, we use ""Opexa,"" ""the Company,"" ""we,"" ""our"" and ""us"" to refer to the businesses of Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. Opexa is a biopharmaceutical company that has historically focused on developing personalized immunotherapies with the potential to treat major illnesses, including multiple sclerosis, or MS, as well as other autoimmune diseases such as neuromyelitis optica, or NMO. These therapies are based on Opexa's proprietary T-cell technology. Information related to Opexa's product candidates, Tcelna(R) and OPX-212, is preliminary and investigative. Tcelna and OPX-212 have not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, or other global regulatory agencies for marketing. On October 28, 2016, Opexa announced that its Phase IIb clinical trial, or Abili-T, of its lead product candidate, Tcelna, in patients with secondary progressive MS, or SPMS, did not meet its primary endpoint of reduction in brain volume change, or atrophy, nor did it meet the secondary endpoint of reduction of the rate of sustained disease progression. Abili-T was a 183-patient, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase IIb study that was conducted at 35 clinical trial sites in the U.S. and Canada and designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Tcelna (imilecleucel-T) in patients with SPMS. Patients in the Tcelna arm of the study received two annual courses of Tcelna treatment consisting of five subcutaneous injections per year. Opexa completed enrollment of the Abili-T study in May 2014 and un-blinded the results from the study in late October 2016. Tcelna was considered safe and well tolerated. After further analysis of the data from the Abili-T trial, Opexa has determined that it will not move forward with further studies of Tcelna in SPMS at this time. Resulting from the disappointing clinical trial results, Opexa implemented cost-cutting measures including several reductions in workforce, an assignment of its facility lease and the sale of certain assets. Opexa's current development activities are limited to undertaking a review of its preclinical program for OPX-212 for the treatment of NMO and the related T-cell platform, in addition to completing the strategic process discussed below. Opexa has incurred net losses in each year since its inception. As of June 30, 2017, Opexa had an accumulated deficit of approximately $162.9 million. Substantially all of Opexa's net losses have resulted from costs incurred in connection with Opexa's research and development programs and from general and administrative costs associated with its operations. As a consequence of the disappointing results from the Abili-T trial, Opexa's board of directors began evaluating its strategic options to maximize shareholder value, including the possibility of seeking a merger, a sale of the company or all or some of its assets and/or distributing some or all of Opexa's remaining cash through either a dividend or a liquidation of Opexa. Opexa management conducted a process of identifying and evaluating potential strategic combinations, or other transactions, with biotechnology companies. On June 30, 2017, Opexa, Opexa Merger Sub, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Opexa, and Acer Therapeutics, Inc. (""Acer"") entered into the Agreement and Plan of Merger and Reorganization (the ""Merger Agreement""), pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub will merge with and into Acer, with Acer becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Opexa and the surviving corporation in the Merger. If the Merger is completed, the business of Opexa will become the business of Acer. If the Merger is not completed, Opexa will reconsider its strategic alternatives and could pursue one of the following courses of action, which Opexa currently believes to be the most likely alternatives if the Merger with Acer is not completed: ? Pursue another strategic transaction. Opexa may resume its process of evaluating a potential merger, reorganization or other business combination transaction. Until the proposed Merger with Acer is completed, Opexa cannot predict whether or to what extent it might resume drug development activities, or what its future cash needs would be for any such activities. Opexa was incorporated in Texas in March 1991. Our principal executive offices are located at 2635 Technology Forest Blvd., The Woodlands, Texas 77381, and our telephone number is (281) 775-0600. License Agreement with Baylor College of Medicine In 2001, Opexa entered into an agreement with Baylor College of Medicine for the exclusive worldwide license to a patient-specific, autologous T-cell immunotherapy for the treatment of MS, which is the initial T-cell technology on which Tcelna is based, including rights to certain patents held by Baylor. In consideration for the right and license to commercially exploit such technology, Opexa agreed to pay the following (per scenario 1 of the license agreement): (i) a 2% royalty on net sales of licensed patented products sold by Opexa or its affiliates where annual gross sales of such products is less than or equal to $500 million; (ii) a 1% royalty on net sales of licensed patented products sold by Opexa or its affiliates where annual gross sales of such products exceed $500 million; (iii) a 1% royalty on net sales of licensed patent pending products sold by Opexa or its affiliates; and (iv) a 1% royalty on net sales of licensed patented products or licensed patent pending products sold by any sublicensees of Opexa. Unless earlier terminated, the Baylor license agreement expires in 2025 upon expiration of the last of the licensed patent rights. Critical Accounting Policies General. Opexa's discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on its consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. The preparation of these financial statements requires Opexa to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and expenses. Opexa bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Opexa believes the following critical accounting policies affect its most significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition. Opexa adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, 605, ""Revenue Recognition."" ASC 605 requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized: (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (2) delivery has occurred or services rendered; (3) consideration is fixed or determinable; and (4) collectability is reasonably assured. On February 4, 2013, Opexa entered into an Option and License Agreement, the Merck Serono Agreement, with Ares Trading SA, or Merck Serono. Pursuant to the terms, Merck Serono had an option to acquire an exclusive, worldwide (excluding Japan) license of Opexa's Tcelna program for the treatment of MS, or the Option. The Option was exercisable by Merck Serono prior to or upon Opexa's completion of the Abili T Phase IIb clinical trial for Tcelna in patients with secondary progressive MS. Opexa received an upfront payment of $5 million for granting the Option and recognized revenues from the nonrefundable, up-front Option fee on a straight-line basis over the estimated Option exercise period which coincided with the expected completion term of the Abili-T trial. The expected completion term for revenue recognition was December 2016. On March 9, 2015, Opexa entered into a First Amendment of Option and License Agreement with Merck Serono to amend the Merck Serono Agreement, or the Merck Serono Amendment. Opexa received $3 million in consideration for certain activities to be conducted in connection with preparation for operational readiness for further clinical studies of Tcelna and for providing Merck Serono with updates and analysis with respect to Opexa's immune monitoring program that was conducted in conjunction with the Abili-T clinical trial. Opexa evaluated the Merck Serono Amendment and determined that the $3 million payment from Merck Serono had stand-alone value due to Opexa's performance obligations thereunder. The $3 million payment was determined to be a single unit of accounting and was recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the period equivalent to the expected completion of the performance obligations in December 2016. On October 28, 2016, Opexa announced that the Abili-T clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tcelna in patients with SPMS did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints. On November 23, 2016, Opexa received notice from Merck Serono that Merck Serono would not be exercising the Option, and as a result of such notice, the Merck Serono Agreement automatically expired. Stock-Based Compensation. We adopted the provisions of FASB ASC 718 which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee service. We utilize the Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock-based compensation at the date of grant, which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions, including expected volatility and expected life. Changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share-based compensation. These assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. When estimating fair value, some of the assumptions will be based on, or determined from, external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with stock-based payment arrangements. The appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment, based on relevant facts and circumstances. We estimated volatility by considering historical stock volatility. We have opted to use the simplified method for estimating expected term of options as equal to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term. Research and Development. The costs of materials and equipment or facilities that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternative future uses are capitalized as tangible assets when acquired or constructed. The cost of such materials consumed in research and development activities and the depreciation of such equipment or facilities used in those activities are research and development costs. However, the costs of materials, equipment, or facilities acquired or constructed for research and development activities that have no alternative future uses are considered research and development costs and are expensed at the time the costs are incurred. Results of Operations and Financial Condition Comparison of the Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 with the Three Months Ended June 30, 2016. Revenue. Revenues of $0 and $726,291 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, included $0 and $307,686, respectively, related to the $5 million payment from Merck Serono in connection with the Merck Serono Agreement. Revenues for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 also include $0 and $418,605, respectively, related to the $3 million payment from Merck Serono in connection with the Merck Serono Amendment (see Revenue Recognition). No revenue was recognized in 2017 as all revenue from Merck Serono payments was recognized in full by December 2016. Research and Development Expenses.Research and development expenses were a credit of $796 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $1,814,940 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The $796 credit balance was due to receipt of a credit memo for $8,397 which more than offset the total expenses of $7,601 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in expenses is primarily due to cost reductions in connection with the winding down of the clinical trial of Tcelna in SPMS, including our site expenses as well as additional expense reduction due to a pause in NMO study development cost. Additionally, expenses were further reduced due to the workforce reductions over the past year. General and Administrative Expenses.General and administrative expenses were $678,660 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $953,582 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in expenses is primarily due to the workforce reduction over the past year as well as a reduction in rent and property taxes. These reductions were slightly offset by an increase in professional services and no reallocation of general and administrative expenses to research and development. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses.Depreciation and amortization expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $0, compared with $65,653 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in depreciation is due to the sale of certain furniture, fixtures, and equipment (including laboratory and manufacturing equipment) in connection with the assignment of our facilities lease in February 2017 to a third party. Interest Income (Expense), Net. Net interest expense was $302 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $414 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. Other Income and Expense, Net. Other Income and Expense, net was net expense of $26 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $2,749 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease is due to a reduction in the number of Canadian clinical sites still treating patients and the related realized gain in currency fluctuation between the US dollar and the Canadian dollar for payments made to clinical sites located in Canada. Net Loss. We had a net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2017 of $678,192, or $0.09 loss per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of approximately $2.1 million or $0.30 loss per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net loss from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017 is due to the cost reduction efforts taken over the last year. The reduction in both general and administrative expenses as well as research and development expenses, was offset by the completed term for revenue recognition of the Option and License Agreement with Merck Serono in December 2016. Comparison of the Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 with the Six Months Ended June 30, 2016. Revenue. Revenues of $0 and $1,452,582 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, included $0 and $615,372, respectively, related to the $5 million upfront payment from Merck Serono in connection with the Merck Serono Agreement. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 also include $0 and $837,210 respectively, related to the $3 million payment from Merck Serono in connection with Merck Serono Amendment (see Revenue Recognition). No revenue was recognized in 2017 as all revenue from Merck Serono payments was recognized in full by December 2016. Research and Development Expenses.Research and development expenses were $205,228 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $3,644,002 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in expenses are primarily due to the workforce reduction over the past years, partially offset by an increase in contract labor and our employee retention plan. Another major decrease in expense is due to cost reductions in connection with the winding down of the clinical trial of Tcelna in SPMS, including site expenses as well as additional expense reduction due to a pause in NMO study development cost. Additional, expenses were decrease in our site expenses as well as patient and contract research organization travel, safety and laboratory services. General and Administrative Expenses.General and administrative expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $1,398,529 compared with $1,940,830 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in expenses is primarily due to a work force reduction as well as reduction in rent and property taxes. These general and administrative reductions were slightly offset by a decrease in the reallocation of general and administrative expenses to research and development. Depreciation and Amortization Expenses.Depreciation and amortization expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $0 compared with $138,242 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in depreciation is due to the sale of certain furniture, fixtures and equipment (including laboratory and manufacturing equipment) in connection with the assignment of our facilities lease in February 2017 to a third party. Interest Income, Net. Net interest expense was $1,148 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $522 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Other Income and Expense, Net. Other Income and Expense, net was a net income of $441 for the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $4,855 in the six months ending June 30, 2016. The decrease in 2017 is due to a reduction in the number of Canadian clinical sites still treating patients and the related realized gain in currency fluctuation between the US and Canadian dollar for services billed in Canadian dollars, yet paid in US dollars. Offsetting this gain was a reduction in the spot conversion due to decreasing Canadian site liabilities and the corresponding conversion from Canadian to US dollars. Net Loss. We had a net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2017 of approximately $1.6 million, or $0.21 loss per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of approximately $4.3 million or $0.61 loss per share (basic and diluted) for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net loss is primarily due to a reduction in research and development cost as well as a decrease in employee compensation due to the workforce reduction and the winding down of the clinical trial of Tcelna in SPMS, especially a decrease in clinical site and patient related expenses. A decrease in the procurement and use of supplies for product manufacturing and development of Tcelna in SPMS, as well as a net decrease in procurement of supplies and blood samples related to the NMO study development also contributed to the reduction of research and development expenses. These decreases were offset by an execution payment and increased monthly payments to PRA relating to the amendment entered into for the change order relating to our clinical trials management services agreement for the ongoing Abili-T study, as well as stability testing for our custom reagents. Secondly, general and administrative expenses were less due to a reduction in our legal, accounting and securities expenditures. Additionally, due to the workforce reduction, net employee compensation is down. Liquidity and Capital Resources Historically, Opexa has financed its operations primarily through the sale of debt and equity securities. The report of Opexa's independent auditors in respect of the 2016 fiscal year expressed substantial doubt about Opexa's ability to continue as a going concern. Specifically, it noted Opexa's recurring losses, negative operating cash flows and accumulated deficit. The accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements for the six months ended June 30, 2017 have been prepared assuming that Opexa will continue as a going concern, meaning Opexa will continue in operation for the foreseeable future and will be able to realize assets and discharge liabilities in the ordinary course of operations. As of June 30, 2017, Opexa had cash and cash equivalents of $1.8 million as well as accounts payable, short-term notes payable and accrued expenses aggregating $361,547. While Opexa has historically recognized revenue related to certain upfront payments received from Merck Serono in connection with the Option and License Agreement and an amendment thereto, Opexa has never generated any commercial revenues, nor does it expect to generate any commercial revenues for the foreseeable future or other revenues in the near term that will result in cash receipts. Opexa believes that it has sufficient liquidity to support its current activities in winding down the Abili-T trial and for general operations to sustain the Company and support such activities into September 2017. However, if Opexa's projections prove to be inaccurate, or if Opexa encounters additional costs to wind down the trial or to sustain its operations, or if it incurs other costs such as those associated with pursuing further research and development, and if the proposed Merger with Acer is not completed, Opexa would need to raise additional capital to continue its operations. Following the disappointing results from the Phase IIb Abili-T trial announced on October 28, 2016, Opexa's board of directors began evaluating its strategic options to maximize shareholder value, including the possibility of a merger, a sale of the company or all or some of its assets and/or distributing some or all of Opexa's remaining cash through either a dividend or liquidation of Opexa. On June 30, 2017, Opexa entered into the Merger Agreement with Acer pursuant to which, among other things, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, a wholly owned subsidiary of Opexa will merge with and into Acer, with Acer becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Opexa and the surviving corporation in the Merger. If the Merger is completed, the business of Opexa will become the business of Acer. Until the proposed Merger with Acer is completed, Opexa cannot predict whether or to what extent it might resume drug development activities, or what its future cash needs would be for any such activities. Opexa's future capital requirements, both near and long-term, will depend on many factors, including, but not limited to the timing and completion of the proposed Merger with Acer and the extent to which Opexa elects to pursue drug development activities in the future. If the proposed merger is not completed, Opexa will need to determine whether it may be possible to continue the development of its own development programs. If this direction were to be pursued, Opexa would need to raise additional capital in order to conduct further development and would expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing losses for at least the next several years. Given the disappointing results of Opexa's Abili-T trial announced in the fourth quarter of 2016, Opexa believes its ability to issue equity securities or obtain debt financing in the future on favorable terms, or at all, has been substantially impaired. On March 25, 2016, Opexa entered into a new Sales Agreement with IFS Securities, Inc. (doing business as Brinson Patrick, a division of IFS Securities, Inc.) as sales agent, pursuant to which Opexa can offer and sell shares of its common stock from time to time depending upon market demand, in transactions deemed to be an ""at the market"" offering. Opexa registered up to 1,000,000 shares of common stock for potential sale under the new ATM facility. During January 2017, Opexa sold an aggregate of 516,278 shares of common stock for gross proceeds of $490,098, with the average share price ranging from $0.90 to $0.97. Proceeds net of fees and deferred offering cost were $413,662. Opexa will need to keep . . . Aug 14, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

ACER,"NEWTON, Mass., Mar 07, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Acer Therapeutics Inc. ACER, +8.75% a pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and ultra-rare diseases with critical unmet medical need, today reported financial results for the quarter and full-year ended December 31, 2017 and provided an update on the Company's recent corporate developments. ""We accomplished a lot in 2017 that sets the stage nicely for us to deliver on multiple significant milestones anticipated in 2018. We believe that by going public, hiring several key executives and raising enough capital to fund our current operating requirements through the end of this year, we are now in a position to finalize the critical activities over the next few months required to submit a New Drug Application (NDA) for EDSIVO(TM) in vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (vEDS),"" said Chris Schelling, CEO and Founder of Acer. ""We are also working very closely with the vEDS community to better understand their needs and to learn how we can best partner with them going forward. Collectively, we are exploring how Acer can begin supporting initiatives that help strengthen patient advocacy and establish centers of excellence, accelerate diagnosis and optimize patient care, and sponsor additional research collaborations with leading experts in vEDS."" Mr. Schelling continued, ""Beyond vEDS, we look to advance and expand our pipeline with the goal of bringing multiple products to patients with serious ultra-orphan diseases over the next several years."" 2017 and Recent Highlights Announced positive results from the pivotal clinical trial of EDSIVO(TM) (celiprolol) for the treatment of vEDS. Our retrospective source-verified analysis of the trial data, including the primary and secondary endpoints, confirmed the data from a previously published randomized controlled clinical study of celiprolol [(1)] . We plan to discuss these key data during a pre-NDA meeting with the FDA in the second quarter of 2018. Closed merger with Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. and common stock commenced trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market in the third quarter of 2017 Raised $28.3 million in 2017 through an underwritten public offering and the private placement of securities Expanded management team and independent board directors Ended 2017 with $15.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt, which we believe is sufficient to fund our current operating and capital requirements through the end of 2018 Upcoming Milestones Potential publication of celiprolol vEDS Patient Registry data. The manuscript is currently under peer review, and if accepted, may be published by the end of the first quarter of 2018. Targeting a pre-NDA meeting, which may consist of one or more consults, with the FDA in the second quarter of 2018 Anticipate submitting an NDA to the FDA for EDSIVO(TM) for the treatment of vEDS at the end of the first half of 2018 Continuing pre-commercial activities for EDSIVO(TM) Making additional senior-level commercial and medical affairs hires this year, as well as continuing to build out the commercial team and add other core personnel later this year Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Cash position. Cash and cash equivalents were $15.6 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $1.8 million as of December 31, 2016. Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Research and development expenses were $8.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Our research and development expenses continue to be primarily focused on spending for clinical development, regulatory, and manufacturing services related to EDSIVO(TM). General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $2.4 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $0.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses were $5.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared with $1.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in expenses is primarily due to an increase in pre-commercial activities related to EDSIVO(TM) and professional services costs. Net Loss. Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $4.2 million, or $0.63 loss per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $2.1 million, or $0.87 loss per share (basic and diluted), for the three months ended December 31, 2016. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $14.2 million, or $3.84 loss per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of $6.7 million, or $2.73 loss per share (basic and diluted) for the year ended December 31, 2016.

We became a public Nasdaq-listed company, closed a concurrent financing and announced positive results from our pivotal clinical trial of EDSIVO(TM), each a critical step in bringing us closer to our goal of becoming a leading pharmaceutical company that acquires, develops and commercializes therapies for the treatment of patients with serious rare and ultra-rare diseases with critical unmet medical need,"" said Chris Schelling, CEO and Founder of Acer. ""We continue to successfully advance our lead product candidate, EDSIVO(TM), a potential life-saving therapy for patients with vEDS. We believe that our current cash position will allow us to advance EDSIVO(TM) through NDA submission with the FDA in the first half of 2018. As a public company, we look forward to advancing and expanding our pipeline with the goal of bringing multiple products to patients over the next several years."" Corporate Activities Closed merger with Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. and $15.7 million concurrent financing, and common stock commenced trading on Nasdaq Capital Market. Announced positive results from the pivotal clinical trial of EDSIVO(TM) (celiprolol) for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS). Acer's retrospective source-verified analysis of the trial data, including the primary and secondary endpoints, confirmed the data from a previously published randomized controlled clinical study of celiprolol(1). Acer plans to use such pivotal clinical data to support a New Drug Application (NDA) regulatory filing with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first half of 2018.

Research and Development Expenses. Research and development expenses were $2.1 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared with $1.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in expenses is primarily due to an increase in spending for clinical development and manufacturing services related to EDSIVO(TM). General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses were $1.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared with $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.

ACER,"Sep 25, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- - Company intends to file NDA for EDSIVO(TM) in first half of 2018 - CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 25, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Acer Therapeutics Inc., ACER, +8.75% a pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and ultra-rare diseases with critical unmet medical need, today announced positive results from the pivotal clinical trial of EDSIVO(TM) (celiprolol) for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (vEDS). Acer's retrospective source verified analysis of the trial data, including the primary and secondary endpoints, confirmed the data from a previously published randomized controlled clinical study of celiprolol(1). Acer will use this pivotal clinical data to support a New Drug Application (NDA) regulatory filing in the U.S. in the first half of 2018. Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue. vEDS is the most severe subtype where patients suffer from life threatening arterial dissections and ruptures, as well as intestinal and uterine ruptures. There are currently no FDA approved therapies for vEDS(2). ""We have studied celiprolol for nearly two decades in vEDS patients and this is the only drug to ever demonstrate a clinical benefit in this difficult to treat patient population in a randomized, controlled clinical study,"" said Pierre Boutouyrie M.D., Ph.D., co-director of the clinical pharmacology service at the Georges-Pompidou European Hospital, Greater Paris University Hospitals (AP-HP) and Principal Investigator for the published celiprolol study. ""Having established celiprolol as the standard of care in France for vEDS patients, we are excited to collaborate with Acer to help bring celiprolol to U.S. patients who are suffering from this devastating, life-threatening disease."" The previously completed European study, published on October 30, 2010, in The Lancet, was stopped early having achieved statistical significance in its primary endpoints, with arterial dissection or rupture affecting 5 (20%) celiprolol patients and 14 (50%) subjects in the non-treated control group (hazard ratio [HR] 0.36; p-value 0.04). The combined primary and secondary endpoints of intestinal or uterine rupture affected 6 (24%) celiprolol patients and 17 (61%) subjects in the non-treated control group (HR 0.31; p-value 0.01). The study was conducted in 53 patients, who were randomly assigned either a twice daily treatment of celiprolol or no treatment. Mean duration of follow-up was 47 months prior to trial halt. ""We are committed to bringing EDSIVO(TM) to vEDS patients who currently do not have access to this treatment,"" said Robert D. Steiner, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Acer. ""Our confirmation of the published celiprolol clinical data with an Acer-sponsored retrospective source verified analysis of the trial data represents a critical element of the clinical module in our NDA, which we are diligently building, along with current manufacturing, non-clinical and other components of the regulatory package."" ""We continue to successfully rapidly advance our lead product candidate, EDSIVO(TM), a potential life-saving therapy for patients with vEDS, towards an NDA filing, which we expect to accomplish in the first half of 2018,"" said Chris Schelling, CEO and Founder of Acer. ""In addition to source verifying a definitive Event-Free Survival endpoint from a previously completed robust clinical study, modernizing manufacturing and assembling other components of the regulatory package, we are executing on a number of key medical affairs focused initiatives for vEDS patients. Specifically, we are setting up Centers of Excellence to optimize patient care, and intend to develop a prospective vEDS Patient Registry and provide integrated care support programs."" About EDSIVO(TM) and vEDS Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (EDS) is a group of hereditary disorders of connective tissue. vEDS is the most severe subtype where patients suffer from life threatening arterial dissections and ruptures, as well as intestinal and uterine ruptures. The average mortality is 51 years of age. An Acer commissioned patient-finder study identified 2,200 vEDS patients in the U.S. from an analysis of commercially available patient claims data. However, experts estimate as many as 5,000 patients may be affected. There are currently no FDA-approved therapies for vEDS(2). Acer is advancing EDSIVO(TM) (celiprolol), a new chemical entity (NCE), for the treatment of vEDS and plans to file a NDA based on a randomized controlled clinical study of celiprolol.(1) In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted EDSIVO(TM) orphan drug designation for the potential treatment of vEDS.

ACER,"Aug 14, 2017 (ACCESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- THE WOODLANDS, TX / ACCESSWIRE / August 14, 2017 / Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. OPXA, -9.36% a biopharmaceutical company developing personalized immunotherapies for autoimmune disorders, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 201 and provided an update on the Company's recent corporate developments. ''On July 3rd, we were pleased to announce the planned merger with Acer Therapeutics,'' said Neil K. Warma, President and Chief Executive Officer of Opexa. ''After a comprehensive evaluation of strategic alternatives, Acer was selected based on their technology and stage of development of their lead drug candidate. Acer's lead asset, EDSIVO™, a potential life-saving therapy for patients with vEDS could be on the market within the next two years, subject to FDA approval. Opexa shareholders are expected to own approximately 11.2% of the outstanding common shares in the combined company. The proposed merger is expected to close during the third quarter of 2017, subject to the approval of the stockholders of Acer and the shareholders of Opexa.'' Corporate Activities On July 3, 2017, Opexa Therapeutics, Inc. and Acer Therapeutics Inc., a privately-held pharmaceutical company, announced that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which the stockholders of Acer (including investors in a financing that will close concurrently with the merger) are currently estimated to become holders of approximately 88.8% of Opexa's outstanding common stock on a pro forma basis, with current Opexa shareholders expected to own the remaining 11.2%. The proposed merger remains subject to certain conditions, including approval by Opexa's shareholders and Acer's stockholders. In conjunction with the proposed merger, an investor syndicate led by TVM Capital Life Sciences and comprised of existing Acer investors and new investors has committed to invest approximately $15.7 million in Acer (including through a conversion of approximately $5.7 million in outstanding convertible notes) immediately prior to closing of the proposed merger. Financial Results for the Quarter Ended June 30, 2017 Cash position: Cash and cash equivalents were $1,824,355 as of June 30, 2017, compared to $3,444,952 as of December 31, 2016. Research and Development Expenses: Research and development expenses were a credit of $796 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $1,814,940 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The $796 credit balance was due to receipt of a credit memo for $8,397 which more than offset the total expenses of $7,601 for the three months ended June 30, 2017. The decrease in expenses is primarily due to cost reductions in connection with the winding down of the clinical trial of Tcelna in SPMS, including our site expenses as well as additional expense reduction due to a pause in NMO study development cost. Additionally, expenses were further reduced due to the workforce reductions over the past year. General and Administrative Expenses: General and administrative expenses were $678,660 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared with $953,582 for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in expenses is primarily due to the workforce reduction over the past year as well as a reduction in rent and property taxes. These reductions were slightly offset by an increase in professional services and no reallocation of general and administrative expenses to research and development. Net Loss: We had a net loss for the three months ended June 30, 2017 of $678,192, or $0.09 loss per share (basic and diluted), compared with a net loss of approximately $2.1 million or $0.30 loss per share (basic and diluted) for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net loss from June 30, 2016 to June 30, 2017 is due to the cost reduction efforts taken over the last year. The reduction in both general and administrative expenses as well as research and development expenses, was offset by the completed term for revenue recognition of the Option and License Agreement with Merck Serono in December 2016.

ACER,"LONDON, July 18, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- INTRODUCTION The concept of immunotherapies dates back to the 18th century; however, since inception, the field has evolved tremendously and is currently cited as one of the most rapidly growing segments of the pharmaceutical industry. Harnessing immune system components for developing therapeutic solutions has demonstrated significant clinical benefit for various diseases areas, specifically against a number of oncological indications. Immunotherapeutics have gradually gained a strong foothold in the pharmaceutical industry. Post the early success of immune checkpoint inhibitors, T-cell immunotherapy has emerged as another innovative and potent arm of this market.  Download the full report: https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/4675071/  Adoptive immunotherapy is an emerging concept that involves the passive transfer of immune cells, which may or may not be modified / genetically altered to express a desired set of traits and / or features. Characterized by key features such as target specificity, adaptability and the capability to retain immunologic memory, T-cells have been effectively used as therapeutic tools to mediate an artificial immune response. More specifically, T-cell immunotherapies are classified into three major segments, namely chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell, T-cell receptor (TCR) and tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) based therapies. Academicians across the globe have significantly contributed to this field by convening the initial research on potential product candidates; this has served as the intellectual framework for establishment of several start-ups and evolution of the product portfolios of established players in the industry.  The overall market is expected to witness a significant growth in opportunities for a variety of stakeholders in the coming decade. It is important to highlight that various technology providers, aiming to develop and / or support the development of T-cell immunotherapy products with improved efficacy and safety, have designed and introduced advanced platforms for engineering of T-cells. Innovation in this domain, backed by lucrative rounds of venture capital (VC) funding, has led to the discovery of several novel molecular targets and strengthened the research pipelines of companies focused in this space. The capability to target diverse therapeutic areas is amongst the most prominent growth drivers of this market.  SCOPE OF THE REPORT The ""T-Cell Immunotherapy Market, 2017-2030 (2nd edition)"" report features an extensive study of the current market landscape and the future potential of T-cell immunotherapies. Immuno-oncology has been gradually nurtured by researchers over the last several years and is now considered as the fourth major pillar of cancer therapy, after surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As indicated earlier, the T-cell therapy market has evolved significantly over the last few years, offering promising opportunities for a variety of stakeholders. The domain is characterized by a robust and opportunistic pipeline of product candidates focused on targeting hematological cancers and solid tumors. However, with no marketed products, this emerging field is still in its infancy. The report provides a comprehensive overview of the market, focusing particularly on CAR-T therapies, TCR therapies and TIL therapies.  The role of academic players / research institutes has been critical in this domain.
