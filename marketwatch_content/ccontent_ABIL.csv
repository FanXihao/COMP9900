ABIL,"TEL AVIV, Israel, Mar 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Ability Inc. ABIL, -0.91% ABIWF (tase:ABIL) (the ""Company""), a provider of innovative tactical communications intelligence solutions, today announced a 1-for-10 consolidation of its ordinary shares. Beginning on the open of trading on Friday, March 23, 2018, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on a post-consolidated basis on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the Company's existing trading symbol, ""ABIL."" Beginning on the open of trading on Sunday, March 25, 2018, the Company's ordinary shares will trade on a post-consolidated basis on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) under the Company's existing trading symbol, ""ABIL."" The new CUSIP number for the Company's ordinary shares following the consolidation will be G8789K124. In addition, pursuant to their terms, a proportionate adjustment will be made to the per share exercise price and number of shares issuable under the Company's warrants that are currently quoted on the OTC Pink. At market open on March 23, 2018, these warrants will trade on a post-consolidation basis under the trading symbol ""ABIWFD"" for 20 business days, after which time the ""D"" will be removed and the warrants will resume trading under the ticker symbol ""ABIWF"". The new CUSIP number for these warrants following the consolidation will be G8789K132. As previously reported, the Company currently has until April 9, 2018 to regain compliance with the Nasdaq Stock Market's minimum bid price requirement, and, to regain compliance, the Company's ordinary shares must have a minimum bid price per share of at least $1.00 for 10 consecutive business days. The principal reason for the consolidation is to increase the per share trading price of the Company's ordinary share in order to help ensure a share price high enough to satisfy the $1.00 per share minimum bid price requirement. However, there can be no assurance that the consolidation will have the desired effect of sufficiently raising the bid price of the Company's ordinary shares for the required period. The consolidation was previously approved by the Company's shareholders at the Company's annual general meeting held on December 27, 2017. At the effective time of the consolidation on the OTC Pink, Nasdaq and the TASE, every ten ordinary shares of the Company will be combined into one ordinary share of the Company. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the consolidation and instead, all fractional shares will be rounded to the next whole number of shares. When the consolidation takes effect, shareholders holding ordinary shares in book-entry form or through a brokerage account will have their shares automatically adjusted to reflect the consolidation on the effective date. For those shareholders holding physical share certificates, the Company's transfer agent, Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company Inc., will send a letter of transmittal providing instructions for the exchange of shares. Additional information about the consolidation can be found in the Company's proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 7, 2017, a copy of which is available at www.sec.gov.

ABIL, -0.91% Inpixon INPX, -0.46% The report also point out that service will be the fastest growing segment in the market during the forecast period, ""the integration of new services and solutions into the company's contemporary functioning system or the infrastructure necessitates the company to be acquainted with comprehensive detailed insights about the services. Additionally, the organizations also need to have an in-depth knowledge about the benefits that the new service can offer to their customers and employees. This knowledge is provided through a specific set of channelized services offered by the IoT service providers, and sometimes the solution providers themselves."" GTX Corp. GTXO, +3.45% an Internet of Things (IoT) solutions provider in the personal location, wearable and wandering assistive technology business, recently announced, ""that it will be presenting its new Biometric Insoles and previewing some of its other new products scheduled for launch in 2018, including the children's GPS SmartSole®, GPS InvisaBelt designed for toddlers and the Armatrak GPS Rifle Tracker, at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las VegasJanuary 9-12. Executives from GTX and the Company's strategic partner, Veristride, will be scheduling one-on-one appointments throughout the week. For those interested in learning more about this ground breaking and cost savings technology can stop by Thursday, January 11 from 2:00 to 5:00 PM PST in hospitality suite 310 at the Las Vegas Westgate Tower. To schedule a meeting please send an email with CES Meeting in the subject line to info@gtxcorp.com . GTX Corp and Veristride began collaboration in August of 2017 to develop an easy to use, nonvisible, inductive charging, wearable gait solution to analyze movement and activity, using custom sensors at the foot and biomechanical analytics and algorithms to provide gait analysis and movement which is considered a key metric in fall risk detection and prevention for people 65 and older. Gait analysis can also help detect if there is a sudden adverse reaction to new or existing medication, an undetected stroke or even early onset of dementia - all of which for seniors is vital to their wellness, longevity and quality of life, while prevention and early detection can save millions of dollars in healthcare costs. Each year, 2.8 million older people are treated in emergency departments for fall injuries. Over 800,000 patients a year are hospitalized because of a fall injury, most often because of a head injury or hip fracture. Adjusted for inflation, the direct medical costs fall injuries are $31 billion annually.10 Hospital costs account for two-thirds of the total. Patrick Bertagna, GTX Corp CEO, commented, ""Despite preventive efforts, falling continues to be a major problem for seniors both at home and in community or assisted living facilities, not to mention the tremendous cost to the healthcare industry. By simply wearing a pair of biometric insoles, we will be able to monitor a person's activity and any change in balance which in many cases can tell us a lot about that person's overall well-being. Seniors need to stay as active as possible, but many times due to aging, fear, loss of motor skills or loss of memory, they become sedate, which leads to a decline in overall health. Our goal is to provide seniors with wearable technologies that empower them to stay active while not compromising their safety. Being able to prevent, delay or accurately predict falls, undetected strokes, affect from medicines and even early onset of dementia by wearing a smart non-intrusive footwear device can offer significant improvements in senior care and wellness along with substantial cost savings."" …Stacy Bamberg, Veristride CEO, added, ""We are excited to present and demonstrate our gait analytics technology at CES. The biometric insoles will address many important needs for the senior community and help remedy the physical, emotional and financial stresses due to falling. By providing constant symmetry information anytime and anywhere, without having to go to a doctor's office or see a physical therapist, will help drastically improve how people live their lives and the healthcare industry manages costs.""

ABIL,"TEL AVIV, Israel, Oct. 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ability Inc. ABIL, -0.91% (the ""Company""), a leading provider of innovative tactical communications intelligence solutions, today announced that on October 11, 2017 it received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the ""Staff"") that the Company is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company's ordinary shares for the 30 consecutive business days ended October 10, 2017, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement. The deficiency notification does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company's ordinary shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has an initial grace period of 180 calendar days, or until April 9, 2018 (the ""Compliance Period""), to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If, at any time during the Compliance Period, the bid price for the Company's ordinary shares closes at $1.00 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Staff will provide notification to the Company that it complies with the minimum bid price requirement, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this 10-day period requirement pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(F). If the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during the Compliance Period, the Company may be afforded an additional 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, except for the minimum bid price requirement. In addition, the Company would be required to notify Nasdaq of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency. If the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during the Compliance Period and is not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, the Staff will provide notification to the Company that its ordinary shares may be delisted. The Company would then be entitled to appeal the Staff's determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel and request a hearing. There can be no assurance that, if the Company does appeal the delisting determination by the Staff to the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, such appeal would be successful. At present, the Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its ordinary shares and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, which could include effecting a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. About Ability Inc.

ABIL,"TEL AVIV, Israel, June 8, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ability Inc. ABIL, -0.91% (the ""Company""), a leading provider of innovative tactical communications intelligence solutions, today announced that on June 6, 2017 it received notification from the Listing Qualifications Department of The Nasdaq Stock Market (the ""Staff"") that the Company is not in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement set forth in Nasdaq's Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) requires listed securities to maintain a minimum bid price of $1.00 per share and Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A) provides that a failure to meet the minimum bid price requirement exists if the deficiency continues for a period of 30 consecutive business days. Based on the closing bid price of the Company's ordinary shares for the 30 consecutive business days ended June 5, 2017, the Company no longer meets the minimum bid price requirement. The deficiency notification does not result in the immediate delisting of the Company's ordinary shares from the Nasdaq Capital Market. In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has an initial grace period of 180 calendar days, or until December 4, 2017 (the ""Compliance Period""), to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If, at any time during the Compliance Period, the bid price for the Company's ordinary shares closes at $1.00 or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, the Staff will provide notification to the Company that it complies with the minimum bid price requirement, unless the Staff exercises its discretion to extend this 10 day period requirement pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(F). If the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during the Compliance Period, the Company may be afforded an additional 180 calendar day period to regain compliance. To qualify, the Company would be required to meet the continued listing requirement for market value of publicly held shares and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, except for the minimum bid price requirement. In addition, the Company would be required to notify Nasdaq of its intent to cure the minimum bid price deficiency. If the Company does not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement during the Compliance Period and is not eligible for an additional compliance period at that time, the Staff will provide notification to the Company that its ordinary shares may be delisted. The Company would then be entitled to appeal the Staff's determination to a Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel and request a hearing. There can be no assurance that, if the Company does appeal the delisting determination by the Staff to the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications Panel, such appeal would be successful. At present, the Company intends to monitor the closing bid price of its ordinary shares and may, if appropriate, consider available options to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement, which could include effecting a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. About Ability Inc.

ABIL,"TEL AVIV, Israel, May 16, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ability Inc. ABIL, -0.91% (the ""Company""), a leading provider of innovative tactical communications intelligence solutions, today announced its financial results for the three and 12 months ended December 31, 2016. The Company also filed today with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC"") its Annual Report on Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the ""Annual Report'). This press release should be read in conjunction with the Annual Report. The Annual Report can be accessed on the SEC's website at http://www.sec.gov as well as on the Investor Relations page of the Company's web site at http://ir.interceptors.com/sec-filings. Shareholders may receive a hard copy of the Annual Report, free of charge, upon request. Anatoly Hurgin, Ability's Chief Executive Officer commented: ""Although the market penetration of the ULIN technology has been more challenging than we had expected, we continue to be encouraged by the great interest in ULIN around the world and we are hopeful that this interest will translate into revenues over the next quarters. I believe our new directors, Levi Ilsar, Brigadier General (Ret.) Eli Polak and Nimrod Schwartz, all of whom have meaningful experience, will create significant value to our company."" 2016 Fourth Quarter Financial Summary Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2016 were $2.5 million compared with $2.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2015. Revenues include the contribution from the first ULIN sale, which amounted to approximately $1.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Gross margin for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased to 54.1% compared to 13.3% in the same period the previous year. The increase was primarily due to the absence of cost of revenues in the fourth quarter of 2016 in connection with the first sale of ULIN due to the waiver of the ULIN supplier of its right to the excess of the 50% of the net revenues generated from such sale over the minimum commitment amount such supplier is entitled to. Net loss for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $(3.8) million, or $(0.16) per basic and diluted share, compared with $(380,000), or $(0.02) per basic and diluted share, for the fourth quarter of 2015. Negative EBITDA for the three months ended December 31, 2016 was $(3.3) million compared to $(381,000) in the fourth quarter of 2015. Please refer to the financial tables below for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP results. The results for the fourth quarter of 2016 reflect approximately $1.7 million in non-operational costs in connection with the internal investigation that the Company conducted that was overseen by the Company's Audit Committee regarding the previously announced restatement. No similar expenses were incurred in the year-ago period. In addition, the Company expensed approximately $300,000 of legal fees in connection with the previously announced $1.8 million legal settlement regarding a claim brought against Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, and the Company's controlling shareholders, Messrs. Anatoly Hurgin and Alexander Aurovsky. The amount was reduced in the fourth quarter of 2016 by approximately $100,000 primarily due to the final allocation of the settlement amount between Ability Computer & Software Industries Ltd. and the Company's controlling shareholders. The aggregate settlement amount for the claim was settled at $2.12 million plus VAT, of which the Company was required to pay 70% and the aggregate VAT, and Messrs. Hurgin and Aurovsky were each required to pay half of the remaining balance. 2016 Full-Year Financial Summary Due to the significant decline in revenues and an increase in legal and professional services fees, the Company has suffered losses from operations, and has a net capital deficiency that, along with other matters, raises a substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.    Revenues for the full-year 2016 were $16.5 million compared with $52.2 million for 2015. The decrease was primarily due to customer adoption of ULIN, which has been much slower than the Company had anticipated, the project-oriented nature of Company's business and the completion of a number of large projects in 2015, as well as the ongoing transition to a revenue stream more focused on ULIN. Gross margin for 2016 was 47.8% compared with 43.1% for 2015. The increase was primarily due to the absence of cost of revenues in 2016 in connection with the first sale of ULIN due to the waiver of the ULIN supplier of its right to the excess of the 50% of the net revenues generated from such sale over the minimum commitment amount such supplier is entitled to. Net loss for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $(8.1) million, or $(0.33) per basic and diluted share, compared with net income of $14.8 million, or $0.60 per basic and diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Negative EBITDA for the full year 2016 was $(6.4) million compared to a positive $18.0 million in 2015. Please refer to the financial tables below for a reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP results. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the Company incurred $4.6 million in non-operating expenses, including $2.6 million in legal and professional services fees in connection with the internal investigation the Company conducted that was overseen by Company's Audit Committee and $2.0 million in connection with a legal settlement and related legal fees, as mentioned above.               Balance Sheet Highlights Cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2016 totaled $11.8 million compared to $25.8 million as of December 31, 2015. Cash used in operating activities was $10.6 million for the full year 2016 compared with cash provided by operating activities of $10.2 million for the full year 2015. Shareholders' equity totaled $9.7 million as of December 31, 2016 compared with $17.8 million as of December 31, 2015. About Ability Inc.

ABIL,"TEL AVIV, Israel, May 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Ability Inc. ABIL, -0.91% (the ""Company""), a leading provider of innovative tactical communications intelligence solutions, today announced that it has filed a Form 12b-25, Notification of Late Filing, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Company was unable to file, without unreasonable effort and expenses, its annual report on Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016 (the ""Annual Report"") on or before the prescribed due date of May 1, 2017. As previously disclosed, Company's independent board members resigned in early April and Company's management has had to devote substantial time and effort to identify replacements and address various regulatory issues that have arisen in connection with the resignations. The Company has therefore been unable to conclude internal and external discussions with its advisors on the disclosures for the Annual Report and its financial statements. The Company anticipates that it will file the Annual Report within the prescribed extension period. The Company expects to report for the year ended December 31, 2016, revenues of $16.5 million, a decrease of $35.7 million, or 68%, compared to total revenues of $52.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2015. This change in results of operations is primarily attributable to the ongoing transition to a revenue stream more focused on ULIN, the customer adoption of which has been much slower than the Company had anticipated.
