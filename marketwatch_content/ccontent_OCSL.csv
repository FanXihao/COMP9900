OCSL,"Bloomberg NEW YORK (MarketWatch) – Fifth Street Asset Management said Wednesday it is postponing its initial public offering, citing continued volatility and difficult conditions in the equity markets. The credit-focused asset manager with nearly $6 billion under management did not offer any possible timing for another attempt at a listing. “While we received demand from potential investors, market conditions are not optimal for an IPO at this time,” Chief Executive Leonard M. Tannenbaum said in a statement. The recent wild swings in the market, fueled by global growth concerns, tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East and Ebola fears, has many companies thinking twice about going public. Seven other companies have pulled their IPOs this month, according to data from Dealogic. Fifth Street Asset Management was planning to offer 8 million shares of common stock at a price range of $24 to $26 a share. The Greenwich, Connecticut-based company was supposed to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol FSAM. Two other asset managers that completed IPOs this year are currently trading below their issue price. Shares of Ares Management LP ARES, +0.00%  , which went public in May, were last trading at $16.80, 11.6% below their issue price of $19 a share. Shares of Medley Management Inc. MDLY, -0.88%  , which went public in September, were trading at $16.72, 7.2% below their issue price of $18. Tannenbaum, a former equity analyst at Merrill Lynch, founded the Fifth Street entities in 1998. Fifth Street Asset Management has two publicly-traded business development companies, Fifth Street Finance Corp. US:FSC   and Fifth Street Floating Rate Corp. US:FSFR  . BDCs invest in the debt of smaller companies and are sometimes compared to venture capital fund. as they serve growth-stage businesses that may otherwise find it difficult to access capital. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, RBC Capital Markets and Credit Suisse were the mandated underwriters on the IPO.

OCSL,"Tracking hedge fund and insider transactions is crucial to our investment strategy. Our research has shown that the 15 most popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds historically have outperformed the market by 18 percentage points ( see the details ). In addition, recent studies on insider trading have shown that investors can outperform the market by 7 percentage points per year by following certain insider purchases. Insiders have strong incentives to diversify their wealth away from the company they work for—and therefore reduce their risk. Ignoring the benefits of diversification and buying the company´s stock anyway can be interpreted as a signal of high confidence in the company. This is why, in addition to using hedge fund filings to develop investing strategies, we also maintain a database of insider purchases and take a brief look at significant insider buys to help investors decide if the company is worth further research. In this article we will look into five companies that are both present in David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital's equity portfolio, and have witnessed insider purchases over the past three months. First on our list is General Motors Company GM, -1.75% the $58.5 billion market cap auto manufacturer. Although Greenlight Capital last declared that its position in the company had remained unchanged over the fourth quarter of 2013, its bets are still quite high. As the third most valuable holding in the fund's equity portfolio, Greenlight owns more than 17 million shares -valued at more than $622 million- which account for more than 10% of the total value of its equity portfolio. Einhorn is not the only one who is bullish about General Motors. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has more than $1.5 billion invested in the auto-maker. And their bet is quite easy to understand. As the auto market recovers in the U.S. and Europe, the company should deliver strong earnings growth. In fact, analysts expect the company to deliver average annual EPS growth rates around 17%-18% over the next five years, outperforming its peers by more than 40%. This must be why most analysts recommend buying this stock, despite its above average valuation of 16x P/E, versus an industry average of 11.7x. Finally, if hedge fund and analyst bullishness is not enough for you, here´s a little bonus. Over 2013´s last quarter, Matthew Tsien, Executive Vice President, increased his stake in the company by about 14%. He currently holds 1,600 shares of common stock. During the fourth quarter Greenlight Capital initiated a brand new position in Penn National Gaming PENN, -3.01% a diversified, multi-jurisdictional owner and manager of gaming and pari-mutuel properties, with a market capitalization of almost $1 billion. Offering decent margins, returns and EPS growth prospects (18%-19% per year for the next five) at a decent valuation of 10.8x P/E, this stock certainly looks attractive. Although this is one of Einhonrn´s smallest holdings, comprising less than 0.2% of his portfolio, the acquisition reflects some bullishness. Besides Einhorn, insiders at Penn National Gaming are also betting on its future. Saul Reibstein, Sr. Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, acquired the company's stock twice over the past few months. On November 27th he acquired 500 shares for $14.47 each. Then, on Feb. 18th, he augmented his stake again, by 451 shares, for a total of 2,800 shares. Paul Reeder, Paul Orlin, and Paul Marshall are among hedge fund managers with bullish PENN positions. Yet another small holding of Einhorn's that is worth mentioning is Fifth Street Finance Corp. US:FSC a $1.3 billion market cap specialty finance company. Although Greenlight´s holdings in this company saw no activity over 2013´s fourth quarter, its $24 million stake (almost 2 million shares) should not be discounted. Neither should we ignore the four insider purchases that the company witnessed last December. Between Dec. 2nd and Dec. 13th, Bernard Berman (President & Secretary), Richard Dutkiewicz (Director), Ivelin Dimitrov (Chief Investment Officer), and Leonard Tannenbaum (CEO) all bought stock from the company. Let's take a look at the details: — Tannenbaum acquired 20,000 shares at $8.98 and now owns more than 2 million shares — Dimitrov bought 1,000 shares at $9.38, 500 shares at $13.50 and 467 shares at $13.40 — Dutkiewicz purchased 250 shares at $9.35. He now holds more than 10,500 shares. — Berman bought 1,000 shares at $9.39. His holdings add up to almost 22,000 shares. There were two companies that Einhorn reduced his stakes in but that still witnessed insider purchases: DST Systems [:DST] and Einstein Noah Restaurant Group [:BAGL]. Moreover, his sales should not be necessarily interpreted as a bearish signal, since his remaining holdings in these companies are worth roughly $200 million. Given his portfolio is worth roughly $7.3 billion, the importance of these positions should not be underestimated. DST Systems, an information processing and computer software services and products provider with a market cap of $4.0 billion, saw Einhorn´s position decrease by 30% over Q4. However, his 1.2 million shares, worth approximately $105 million, still signal plenty of bullishness. Furthermore, other funds like Joel Greenblatt's Gotham Asset Management, Glenn Russell Dubin´s Highbridge Capital Management, and Jerrold Fine's Charter Oak also seem quite fond of DST. In addition, Lowell Bryan, Director, Chairman of the Corporate Governance/Nominating Committees, and a member of the Audit / Compensation / Finance Committees at DST Systems made six separate stock purchases over the past six months. Starting in September, 2013, he added more than 1,400 shares to his holdings, at prices ranging from $75.55 to $91.49 per share. He now owns 11,027 shares of the company. Finally, Einstein Noah, which also witnessed a 27% decrease in Einhorn´s position, still remains an important part of the fund´s holdings. Holding 6.7 million shares, worth almost $100 million, Greenlight is still bullish about the company. The sEdna Morris, Board Director, who acquired 1,000 shares of the company last December, increasing her holdings to 2,990 shares. Hedge fund managers Ira Unschuld and Chao Ku are also betting on the stock.

OCSL,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) — With 10-year Treasurys paying less than 2% and the average one-year CD yielding next to nothing, few would blame you for hunting for higher yields. But many experts will criticize you for venturing into the upper-right-hand quadrant and investing in master limited partnerships and business development companies — investments about which you likely know nothing, investments that Wall Street is eagerly hawking to yield-hungry Americans. Don’t be among those pigs headed for slaughter. J.P. Morgan's Big Loss: Lessons From a Fiasco “Investors who are looking at higher yielding alternatives such as master limited partnerships and business development corporations must recognize that such investments encompass a great deal more risk than typical individual investors may be willing and able to assume,” said Bob Johnson, an independent financial consultant in Charlottesville, Va. “It sounds trite to say, but there are no free lunches when it comes to the risk/reward trade-off,” Johnson said. Business development companies or BDCs are akin to private-equity firms and invest in a variety of investments including equity, mezzanine debt and senior secured loans of typically smaller and less-well-capitalized companies, Johnson said. Examples include Apollo Investment Corp. AINV, -0.57% Fifth Street Finance Corp. FSC BlackRock Kelso Capital Corp. BKCC, -1.49% Solar Capital Ltd. SLRC, -0.54% Triangle Capital Corp. TCAP, -1.62%  , Ares Capital Corp. ARCC, +0.01% Main Street Capital Corp. MAIN, -0.35% and Golub Capital BDC GBDC, -0.45% Master limited partnerships are publicly traded on exchanges and are typically concentrated investments in assets characterized as alternatives — oil, timber, gold and real estate, for example. For their part, Kathy  O'Connor and Jeff Sanders, both of KJ Capital Management, explained in a brief written for this column that MLPs consist of two types of owners, limited partners and one general partner. The general partner is paid, out of the partnership, to manage the day-to-day business of the partnership. In the case of energy infrastructure MLPs, the general partner is typically an energy company.  Examples of MLPs include Enterprise Products Partners EPD, +0.12% Kinder Morgan Energy Partners KMP, +0.63% Williams Partners WPZ, -1.05% Energy Transfer Partners ETP, -1.14%  and Plains All American Pipeline PAA, -0.91% Investors are attracted to these vehicles because they typically offer higher yields than U.S. Treasurys and your local bank. Ares Capital, for instance, has a dividend yield of almost 9.5% and Energy Transfer Partners has a yield of 7.7%. Complex structures, tax rules But average investors should think twice before chasing yields with MLPs and BDCs. “My advice to individual investors is quite simple,” Johnson said. “Reaching for yield in a low-interest-rate environment is fraught with peril. Investors who are unable to accurately analyze and ascertain the risks inherent in such funds should steer clear from them.” The yields may look attractive, he said, “but the vehicles often have layers of fees that erode the ultimate return realized by investors.” Investors must also realize that yield is only one part of the return equation. “Return includes both yield and capital appreciation,” said Johnson. “Some vehicles may be returning principal to investors and, in effect, disguising that as yield.” What’s more, Johnson said these MLPs and BDCs also generate tax-reporting requirements. “Many unsophisticated investors are surprised with the more complicated tax issues that investing in these structures typically entails,” he said. Indeed, because MLPs are partnerships, investors receive K-1s, which “require special reporting on your taxes and require that you, or your accountant, track the investment and distributions over time,” O’Connor and Sanders wrote. Others are in the same camp. “MLP tax filings have become so cumbersome that most hedge funds just avoid them,” said Rob Topping, manager of the Vintox fund and the Vintox Emerging Managers fund. “I guess that would create the inefficiency for a retail investor to want to look at them, but they must be prepared for cumbersome paperwork that is sometimes tardy, such as tax reports, and then look at the dividend coverage” and how fast the underlying asset might get depleted, with MLP’s that are related to commodities or depreciating assets like tankers, Topping said. “Sometimes I feel like there is so much focus on the tax structure that it is not an investment for business reasons,” he said. “People get sucked into the high yield when the underlying cash flows are declining. An example might be natural-gas MLP’s right now — with natural-gas prices where they are is the dividend at risk,” Topping said. “If they are required to pay out a percentage by law, people may know and expect that, but they might think the average life of reserves is greater than stated.” Topping raised another issue with BDCs: They trade at big discounts to NAV. The smaller the market-cap, the worse the discount.  “Unless management is very proactive in realizing value — that is, transferring and growing dividends — they are subject to large liquidity swings,” said Topping. Also, Johnson said, “Investors ought to look at these types of investments not by the structure of the investment but by the fundamental asset class that the structure invests in such as equity, debt, or alternative assets.” That is, if an investor wants exposure, for instance, to real estate, then perhaps an investment in a REIT or REIT fund is appropriate. Likewise, if you want exposure to commodities, perhaps a commodity fund is in order.  “MLPs and BDCs are not other asset classes; they merely represent different ownership structures,” said Johnson. Bottom line: “BDCs and MLPs are more appropriate vehicles for more sophisticated investors,” said Johnson. The case for MLPs Investors who fall into the sophisticated camp — who can analyze and ascertain the risks inherent in such funds — might then consider these words of wisdom. “In choosing among the energy infrastructure MLPs, investors want to be aware of the risks,” wrote O’Connor and Sanders. “From a risk perspective, investors should consider the leverage and incentive distribution rights of the general partner.” At KJ Capital Management, the preference is for MLPs with relatively less leverage because when interest rates rise, the cost of leverage will increase and that will lower the net cash available for distribution. “We also prefer relatively lower level of incentive distribution rights because more of the growth in distributions will accrue to the limited partners,” wrote O’Connor and Sanders. “Several MLPs have acquired their general partners, so that all distributions flow to the limited partners.” Other issues to consider would be a severe economic contraction, which reduces demand, and regulatory, technological or environmental risks. Of course, those are the risks associated with investing in just about any asset class. Where to find yields If it turns out that BDCs and MLPs are not for you, where might you turn for higher yields? Some investors might consider investing in mutual funds that invest in MLPs, such as the Legg Mason ClearBridge Tactical Dividend Income fund CFLGX, +0.90%  or the Legg Mason ClearBridge Equity Income Builder fund SOPAX, +1.34%  . Another possibility: high-quality, high-dividend-yielding stocks.  For instance, Johnson said a popular investing strategy over time has been the so-called “Dogs of the Dow Theory,” which advocates buying the 10 highest yielding stocks in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.  Currently, Johnson said, some of the highest yielding stocks in the Dow are AT&T Inc. T, -1.91% which has a dividend yield of 5.25%; Merck & Co. Inc. MRK, -1.89% with a yield of 4.42%; Verizon Communications Inc. VZ, -1.91%  4.86%; and Pfizer Inc. PFE, -0.96% 3.89%. A word of caution: The Dogs of the Dow Theory typically underperforms during bullish market periods and outperforms during down markets. “However,” Johnson said, “in a market downturn, I would feel much more comfortable holding the stocks of these high-quality, large-capitalization firms rather than the underlying assets contained in the structures of MLPs and BDCs that may be less liquid and of lower quality.” Robert Powell is editor of Retirement Weekly, published by MarketWatch.

Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth in ""Item 1A.

We have based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to us on the date of this quarterly report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. we were externally managed and advised by Fifth Street Management LLC, or FSM or the Former Adviser, and we were named Fifth Street Finance Corp. New Investment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree Upon the closing of the transactions, or the Transaction, contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, by and among Oaktree, our Former Adviser and, for certain limited purposes, Fifth Street Asset Management Inc., or FSAM, the indirect, partial owner of our Former Adviser, and Fifth Street Holdings L.P., the direct, partial owner of our Former Adviser, on October 17, 2017, Oaktree became the investment adviser to each of Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation, or OCSI, and us, and Oaktree paid gross cash consideration of $320 million to our Former Adviser. The closing of the Transaction resulted in an assignment for purposes of the 1940 Act of our investment advisory agreement with FSM, or the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, and, as a result, its immediate termination. The material terms of the services to be provided under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, other than the fee structure, are substantially the same as the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, except that services are provided by Oaktree. See ""Note 11. Related Party Transactions-New Investment Advisory Agreement"" and ""-Administrative Services"" in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. In order to ensure that the Transaction complied with Section 15(f) of the 1940 Act, Oaktree and our Former Adviser agreed to certain conditions. First, for a period of three years after the closing of the Transaction, at least 75% of the members of our Board of Directors must not be interested persons of Oaktree or our Former Adviser. Second, an ""unfair burden"" must not be imposed on us as a result of the closing of the Transaction or any express or implied terms, conditions or understandings applicable thereto during the two-year period after the closing of the Transaction. Basis of Presentation Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. If inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, an investment's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. This includes investment securities that are valued using ""bid"" and ""ask"" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments may be classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions. If the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources, we perform additional procedures to corroborate such information, which may include the market yield technique discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company. Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with management of our Investment Adviser; The Investment Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee; The Audit Committee reviews the preliminary valuations with our Investment Adviser, and our Investment Adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee; The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to our full Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio; and Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio. The fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Board of Directors may reasonably rely on that assistance. As of December 31, 2017, 69.2% of our portfolio at fair value was valued either based on market quotations, the transactions precedent approach or by independent valuation firms. However, our Board of Directors is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. As of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017, approximately 94.7% and 95.4%, respectively, of our total assets represented investments at fair value.

OCSL,"LOS ANGELES, CA, Feb 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation OCSL, +0.71% (""Oaktree Specialty Lending"" or the ""Company""), a specialty finance company, today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017. First Fiscal Quarter 2018 Highlights Total investment income of $33.9 million, or $0.24 per share; Net investment income of $13.3 million, or $0.09 per share; Net asset value per share as of December 31, 2017 of $5.81; Originated $183.0 million of new investment commitments and received $196.4 million in connection with nine full repayments and exits of investments; and Entered into a new secured revolving credit facility, increasing its total capacity to $600 million from $525 million and extending the reinvestment period and maturity date to November 29, 2020 and November 29, 2021, respectively. Management Commentary ""Since we began managing Oaktree Specialty Lending in mid-October, we have been focused on repositioning the portfolio and optimizing our capital structure,"" said Edgar Lee, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Oaktree Specialty Lending. ""We have made considerable progress, including identifying core investments that we intend to hold and developing a monetization strategy for investments that are non-core and we intend to exit. We also closed a new credit facility which expands our borrowing capacity and has attractive pricing and terms. While it is still early in the process, we believe we are on track to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns to our stockholders over time."" Portfolio and Investment Activity As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $1.4 billion and was comprised of investments in 122 companies. These included loans to 75 companies, eight public bond issuances, the investment in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC (""SLF JV I"") and equity investments in 66 companies, including in SLF JV I and 18 private equity funds. 28 of these equity investments were in companies in which Oaktree Specialty Lending also had a debt investment. At fair value, 91.9% of the Company's portfolio as of December 31, 2017 consisted of debt investments, including 56.8% of first lien loans, 19.1% of second lien loans and 16.0% of unsecured debt investments, including the debt investments in SLF JV I. As of December 31, 2017, SLF JV I had $284.5 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 34 portfolio companies. The joint venture generated income of $2.8 million for Oaktree Specialty Lending during the first quarter. The weighted average yield on the Company's debt investments as of December 31, 2017, including the return on our mezzanine note investments in SLF JV I, was 9.0%. As of December 31, 2017, $1.1 billion of the Company's debt investments, or 82.4% of the total debt portfolio, at fair value, had floating interest rates. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company originated $183.0 million of investment commitments, including investments in 13 new and one existing portfolio company, and funded $200.2 million of investments across new and existing portfolio companies. During the quarter, the Company received $196.4 million from the full repayments and exits of nine investments, and $88.4 million from other paydowns and sales of investments. Results of Operations Total investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $33.9 million, including $29.9 million of cash interest income from portfolio investments. Payment-in-kind (""PIK"") interest income, net of PIK collected in cash, represented 2.3% of total investment income for the quarter. Net expenses for the quarter were $20.6 million, a decrease of $3.7 million from the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The decrease in net expenses was due primarily to a $3.2 million decline in interest expense as a result of the repayment of the SBA debentures during the three months ended September 30, 2017. Excluding interest expense, net expenses were $11.0 million, a decrease of $0.5 million, due primarily to a decrease in management fees, board of director fees and administrator, general and administrative expenses, partially offset by an increase in professional fees. Net unrealized depreciation on the investment portfolio for the quarter was $43.5 million, which was primarily due to write-downs on three portfolio companies. Net realized loss for the quarter was $0.3 million. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $45.8 million of cash and cash equivalents, total principal value of debt outstanding of $629.7 million, and $395.0 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facility, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 4.79% as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's total leverage ratio was 0.77x debt-to-equity. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company entered into a new secured syndicated revolving credit facility to, among other things, increase its total capacity under the facility to $600 million from $525 million and extend the reinvestment period and maturity date to November 29, 2020 and November 29, 2021, respectively, as compared to its prior credit facility. In addition, during the quarter, the Company repaid all outstanding borrowings ($29.5 million) under the credit facility with Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. Dividend Declaration The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.085 per share, payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2018. Dividends are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of dividend distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company's stockholders. Portfolio Asset Quality As of December 31, 2017, there were eight investments on which the Company had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or original issue discount (""OID"") income that, in the aggregate, represented 14.5% of the debt portfolio at cost and 3.2% at fair value.

OCSL,"LOS ANGELES, CA, Nov 29, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation (formerly known as Fifth Street Finance Corp. through October 17, 2017) OCSL, +0.71% (""Oaktree Specialty Lending"" or the ""Company""), a specialty finance company, today announced its financial results for the fourth fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017. Fourth Fiscal Quarter 2017 Highlights Net investment income of $11.5 million, or $0.08 per share;  Net asset value per share as of September 30, 2017 of $6.16;  Originated $155.8 million of new investment commitments and received $243.3 million in connection with 17 full repayments and exits of investments;  Amended the secured revolving credit facility with ING Capital LLC and the lenders party thereto, reducing its total capacity to $525 million, from $710 million, and paid off the entire balance of the SBA debentures in the amount of $148 million; and  On August 7, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on December 29, 2017 to stockholders of record on December 15, 2017. Recent Developments On October 17, 2017, Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. was appointed as the investment adviser of the Company and Edgar Lee was appointed Chief Executive Officer. Other members of the executive leadership team include Matt Pendo, Chief Operating Officer, Mel Carlisle, Chief Financial Officer, and Kim Larin, Chief Compliance Officer;  On November 17, 2017, the Company further amended its secured revolving credit facility with ING Capital LLC and the lenders party thereto to (a) decrease the minimum amount of shareholders' equity the Company is required to have under the documents governing the facility as of the last day of any fiscal quarter, starting with the quarter ending September 30, 2017, to $700 million and (b) decrease the minimum amount of net worth that the Company is required to maintain at any time, starting with the quarter ending September 30, 2017, to $650 million. Management Commentary ""We assumed management of Oaktree Specialty Lending on October 17, 2017, and began our portfolio repositioning efforts immediately with a focus on protecting principal and minimizing credit losses,"" said Edgar Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Oaktree Specialty Lending. ""Our long term focus involves managing the portfolio down to a core set of more evenly sized, high-conviction investments, restructuring certain loans, exiting positions when we can obtain fair value and, as loans mature or are refinanced, rotating into loans that are better aligned with Oaktree's approach to credit investing. Based on our demonstrated investment process, disciplined approach to underwriting and substantial expertise in restructuring challenged credits, we look forward to building a portfolio that delivers attractive returns to our stockholders over time."" Portfolio and Investment Activity As of September 30, 2017, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $1.5 billion and total assets were $1.6 billion. The investment portfolio was comprised of investments in 125 companies, consisting of debt investments in 88 of our portfolio companies, six of which were public bond issuances and one of which was in Senior Loan Fund JV I, LLC (""SLF JV I""), and equity investments consisting of common stock, preferred stock or other equity interests in 67 of our portfolio companies, one of which was in SLF JV I, 18 of which were in private equity funds and several of which are in portfolio companies in which we also held a debt investment as of September 30, 2017. At fair value, 92.4% of the Company's portfolio as of September 30, 2017 consisted of debt investments, including 53.9% of first lien loans, 24.1% of second lien loans, and 14.4% of unsecured debt investments, including our debt investments in SLF JV I. As of September 30, 2017, SLF JV I had $276.8 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 32 portfolio companies. The joint venture generated income of $2.8 million for Oaktree Specialty Lending during the fourth quarter. The weighted average yield on the Company's debt investments as of September 30, 2017, including the return on our mezzanine notes investments in SLF JV I, was 9.6%. At September 30, 2017, $1.2 billion of the Company's debt investments, or 83.6% of the total portfolio, at fair value, had floating interest rates. During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company originated $155.8 million of investment commitments in nine new and five existing portfolio companies and funded $168.0 million across new and existing portfolio companies. During the quarter, the Company received $243.3 million in connection with the full repayments and exits of 17 of its investments, and an additional $40.0 million in connection with other paydowns and sales of investments. Results of Operations Total investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 was $35.7 million, including $31.4 million of cash interest income from portfolio investments. Payment-in-kind (""PIK"") interest income, net of PIK collected in cash, represented 5.1% of total investment income for the quarter. Net expenses for the quarter were $24.3 million. Net expenses decreased for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 as compared to the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, due primarily to a decrease in Part I incentive fees, which was attributable to lower pre-incentive fee net investment income and, to a lesser extent, a decrease in base management fees, which was attributable to a reduction in the size of the Company's investment portfolio. Net realized and unrealized losses on the investment portfolio for the quarter were $136.9 million. Net unrealized depreciation on the investment portfolio for the quarter was $116.4 million, which was primarily due to write-downs on six portfolio companies and our equity interest in SLF JV I. Net realized loss for the quarter was $20.5 million, which was primarily the result of the Company's disposition of ERS Acquisition Corp., offset by gains realized on other dispositions. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2017, the Company had $59.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, total principal value of debt outstanding of $680.7 million, and $298.5 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facilities, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 4.25% as of September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, the Company's total leverage ratio was 0.78x debt-to-equity. During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company amended its secured syndicated revolving credit facility led by ING Capital LLC to, among other things, reduce its total capacity under the facility to $525 million, from $710 million, and extend the reinvestment period to January 31, 2018. In addition, during the quarter, the Company paid off the entire balance of its SBA debentures in the amount of $148 million. Dividend Declaration On August 7, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.125 per share, payable on December 29, 2017 to stockholders of record on December 15, 2017. Dividends are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of dividend distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company's stockholders. Portfolio Asset Quality As of September 30, 2017, there were eight investments on which the Company had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or original issue discount (""OID"") income that, in the aggregate, represented 16.4% of the debt portfolio at cost and 4.7% at fair value.

OCSL,"BOSTON, Aug 02, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Acquisition - Completed previously announced acquisition of Fifth Street CLO Management LLC on July 20, 2017, adding approximately $726 million of AUM.  Investment Activity - New funded, middle-market credit investments totaled $460 million in the second quarter, up from $330 million last quarter and compared to $476 million in the same quarter last year.  Managed Assets - Managed loans and credit investments at the end of the quarter decreased slightly from the prior quarter to $6.5 billion due to the amortization and redemption of older managed CLOs issued in 2006 and 2007, which was partly offset by growth in loans held-for-sale and investments in debt securities issued by managed funds to comply with risk retention requirements.  Net Interest Margin - The margin increased to 1.56% for the second quarter from 1.45% in the prior quarter due to a combination of rising index rates, higher deferred loan fee amortization and an increase in loans as a percentage of earning assets.  Revenue - Total revenue [1] in the second quarter was consistent with the prior quarter at $20.2 million as higher net interest income, asset management fees and a gain on the sale of equity interests offset a decrease in fee income from capital markets activities and higher negative mark-to-market adjustments on loans held at fair value.  Credit - Credit costs decreased $3.5 million from the prior period to $2.7 million due primarily to lower specific provision expense, while net charge-offs increased by $2.0 million from the prior period to $7.5 million in the second quarter.  Expenses - Operating expenses decreased by $1.3 million, or 11.5%, from the prior period to $10.3 million as the company achieved planned cost saving targets.  Capital Management - Returned approximately $7.3 million to stockholders in the second quarter through share repurchases and dividends. Book value per share increased to $15.40 as of June 30, 2017, up $0.19 from the end of the prior quarter.  Quarterly Dividend - Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock payable on September 15, 2017 to shareholders of record on August 29, 2017.  NewStar Financial, Inc. NEWS, +0.00% (""NewStar"" or the ""Company""), an internally-managed, middle market direct lender and credit-oriented asset manager, today announced financial results for its second quarter of 2017, reporting net income of $4.2 million, or $0.10 per diluted share. These results compare to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.03 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2017 and $5.2 million, or $0.11 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2016. Operating income before income taxes was $7.2 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $2.4 million for the first quarter of 2017 and $8.8 million in the second quarter of 2016. Tim Conway, NewStar's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the Company's performance: ""Despite continued pricing pressure in the second quarter, our core earnings were solid on a cash basis, excluding negative marks totaling $3.2 million on our liquid credit portfolio. Credit costs remained in check and we continued to reduce expenses, while also taking steps to accelerate growth in managed assets and execute our capital management programs. We returned approximately $7.3 million to stockholders through accretive share repurchases and dividends. We also acquired Fifth Street's CLO business after the close of the quarter, adding $726 million to assets under management. We now have nearly $7.3 billion of managed assets split evenly between the balance sheet and funds. The acquisition is consistent with our strategy to expand our asset management activities in ways that benefit our lending franchise and add to our value proposition by leveraging our core strengths in direct lending, securitization and credit management. It also provides an attractive way to diversify our business mix, adding to fee revenue and accelerating improvement in equity returns."" [1] Total revenue is defined as the sum of net interest income and non-interest income Acquisition Completed the previously announced acquisition of Fifth Street CLO Management LLC (""FSCM"") from Fifth Street Holdings L.P., an affiliate of Fifth Street Asset Management, Inc. (""Fifth Street"") FSAM, -2.29% a publicly-traded credit-focused asset management firm. Formed in 2015 by Fifth Street to manage its middle market CLO business, FSCM manages two CLOs backed by middle-market loans and holds certain interests in its sponsored CLOs primarily to comply with regulatory risk retention requirements.  The purchase price was approximately $16 million in cash, net of $13 million of assumed indebtedness.  The acquisition adds approximately $726 million to NewStar's assets under management, increasing total AUM to approximately $7.25 billion. The transaction closed July 20, 2017.  Dividend Declaration On July 31, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share of common stock to be paid on September 15, 2017, to shareholders of record at the close of business on August 29, 2017.  The declaration and payment of future dividends will be subject to the board's approval. Managed and Owned Investment Portfolios Total new funded, middle-market credit investments were $460 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $330 million in the prior quarter and $476 million in the same quarter last year. The change from the prior quarter reflected an increase in demand for acquisition financing derived from middle market leverage buyout activity amid an increase in M&A activity. The impact of higher loan demand was tempered somewhat by an increase in market liquidity.  Total new liquid credit investments (rated, broadly syndicated loans) held by the Arch Street CLO and held for sale to other managed funds were $157 million in the second quarter compared to $189 million in the prior quarter.  Balance sheet runoff from scheduled amortization, prepayments and loan sales totaled approximately $461 million in the second quarter, or 12.7% of loan and investment balances at the beginning of the period, up from $366 million in the prior quarter. Runoff in the second quarter included $242 million of prepayments, $170 million of loan sales and $48 million of contractual amortization compared to prepayments of $296 million, loan sales of $34 million and amortization of $37 million in the prior quarter.  Average yields on new middle-market loans and other directly originated credit investments in the second quarter were 6.8%, up from 6.6% in the prior quarter, but down from 7.0% in the comparable quarter last year.  Loans and other investments outstanding, excluding assets managed for third parties, were consistent with the prior quarter at $3.6 billion. Compared to the second quarter of 2016, loans and investments decreased by $153 million, or 4.1%, due to the sale of $165 million of equipment finance assets and a $30.8 million decrease in commercial real estate loans, which was partly offset by growth in Leveraged Finance loans.  The Leveraged Finance loan portfolio totaled approximately $3.6 billion at the end of the second quarter, which was consistent with the prior quarter and up $43 million from the prior year. Commercial real estate loans were less than $11 million at the end of the second quarter consistent with the prior quarter and compared to $42 at the same time last year.  Assets held in managed funds decreased by $79 million in the second quarter to approximately $3.3 billion and were up $327 million from the same time last year. The decrease from the prior quarter was due to expected amortization and redemption of CLOs backed by broadly syndicated loans that were past their re-investment periods.  The owned loan portfolio remained defensively positioned - balanced across industry sectors and highly diversified by issuer. As of June 30, 2017, no outstanding borrowings by a single obligor represented more than 1.2% of total loans outstanding, and the ten largest obligors comprised approximately 8.4% of the loan portfolio.  Net Interest Income / Margin Net interest income increased by $1.0 million to $15.0 million in the second quarter compared to $14.0 million in the prior quarter. Compared to the second quarter of last year, net interest income decreased by $5.9 million, or 28.2%. The decrease was due primarily to a decrease in average loan balances and higher cost of funds driven partly by rising LIBOR index rates.  The portfolio yield was 6.43% in the second quarter up from 6.29% in the prior quarter and 6.28% in the comparable period in the prior year.  Funding costs were 5.08% in the second quarter, up from 4.99% in the first quarter and 4.65% in the comparable period in the prior year due to increasing LIBOR index rates, changes in the mix of debt and higher average cost of funds for new CLO issuance.  As a result, the net interest margin widened to 1.56% for the second quarter of 2017 compared to 1.45% for the prior quarter and 2.10% in the second quarter of 2016.  Non-Interest Income Non-interest income decreased by $1.0 million to $5.2 million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $6.2 million in the prior quarter and $4.4 million in the same period last year. The change reflected a $1.0 million decrease in capital markets-related fee income and negative mark to market adjustments totaling $3.2 million compared to negative adjustments of $2.8 million in the prior quarter offset by differences in other miscellaneous income.  Other non-interest income items in the second quarter of 2017 were centered in asset management fees of $3.8 million and $1.8 million of other income.  Credit Performance Provision expense was $2.7 million in the second quarter, down from $6.1 million in the prior quarter, and down from $3.6 million in the same quarter last year.  Total net specific provision expense decreased by approximately $3.0 million in the second quarter to $3.3 million compared to $6.3 million in the prior quarter and $2.4 million in the same quarter last year. Provisioning activity in the second quarter included a $2.0 million specific charge in connection with the expected sale of a borrower in connection with the resolution of a long-term work-out.  Net charge-offs in the second quarter of 2017 were $7.5 million compared to $5.5 million in the prior quarter.  The allowance for credit losses was $47.3 million, or 1.75% of consolidated loans and approximately 49.7% of non-performing loans (NPLs), at June 30, 2017, compared to $52.1 million, or 1.85% of consolidated loans and approximately 50.7% of NPLs, at March 31, 2017.  Non-performing loans decreased by $7.7 million to $95.1 million, or 3.06% of loans held for investment at June 30, 2017, compared to $102.8 million or 3.18% of loans held for investment at the end of the prior quarter due primarily to charge-off activity. Expenses Total operating expenses for the second quarter decreased by $1.3 million to $10.3 million compared to $11.6 million in the prior quarter, reflecting targeted cost savings from actions taken over the last twelve months to streamline operations.  As a result, expenses as a percentage of average assets under management decreased to 0.64% in the second quarter compared to 0.68% in the prior quarter.  Adjusted operating expenses, which excludes non-cash equity compensation and severance costs, were $9.4 million in the second quarter down from $10.8 million during the first quarter.  The Company had 66 full-time employees at June 30, 2017 compared to 69 full-time employees at March 31, 2017 and 90 employees at June 30, 2016. The reduction in staffing levels during 2016 reflects the sale of the asset-based lending and equipment finance businesses, as well as other related strategic initiatives to streamline operations.  Income Taxes Deferred income taxes decreased $3.7 million to $36.9 million as of June 30, 2017. The decrease was driven primarily by charge-off activity in the allowance for credit losses and timing differences related to compensation expense recognition.  Approximately $23.7 million and $6.7 million of the net deferred tax asset as of June 30, 2017 were related to our allowance for credit losses and incentive compensation, respectively.  Funding and Capital Total cash and equivalents as of June 30, 2017, were $273.0 million, of which $49.7 million was unrestricted.  Unrestricted cash increased to $49.7 million at June 30, 2017, from $15.4 million at the end of the prior quarter due primarily to cash management activities. Total available liquidity was $67.3 million at June 30, 2017, including unrestricted cash and $17.6 million of collateralized availability under credit facilities.  Restricted cash decreased by $86.1 million to $223.3 million at June 30, 2017 due primarily to cash collections on assets held in CLOs and other special purpose vehicles (SPVs) ahead of settlement dates, when restricted cash is disbursed to various stakeholders, including the Company.  Advances under credit facilities increased by $22.0 million to $396.1 million during the second quarter due primarily to lending activity and discretionary cash management activities.  Term debt securitization balances decreased from the prior quarter by $44.5 million to $2.1 billion at June 30, 2017.  As a result, total debt increased slightly to $3.2 billion at June 30, 2017 and leverage stayed the same at 5.0x for the end of the second quarter.  Equity Book value per share increased by $0.19 to $15.40 at the end of the second quarter compared to $15.21 at the end of the prior quarter due primarily to accretive share repurchases and retained earnings.  Average diluted shares outstanding totaled 41.3 million for the quarter, down from 41.8 million for the prior quarter, and total outstanding shares at June 30, 2017 were 41.8 million compared to 42.3 million at March 31, 2017.  The Company repurchased 629,997 shares at an average cost of $10.29, or approximately $6.5 million, and paid dividends totaling $0.8 million in the second quarter.  Pre-tax returns on average equity increased to 4.5% in the second quarter from 1.5% in the prior quarter. On an after-tax basis, returns on average equity increased to 2.6% in the second quarter from 0.9% from the prior quarter.

Forward-Looking Statements This release contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements regarding future performance, our expectations regarding our ability to support continued future asset growth or expense reductions and the declaration of future dividends. All statements other than statements of historical fact included in this release are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements give our current expectations and projections relating to our financial condition, results of operations, strategic plans (including those relating to the transition to a hybrid asset manager), the market price for NewStar's stock prevailing from time to time, the nature of other investment opportunities presented to NewStar from time to time, objectives, future performance, financing plans and restrictive covenants in our debt instruments. As such, they are subject to material risks and uncertainties, including our ability to leverage new and future assets to support growth, the continued success of our strategic relationships; the general state of the economy; our ability to compete effectively in a highly competitive industry; our ability to integrate acquired businesses; and the impact of federal, state and local laws and regulations that govern non-depository commercial lenders and businesses generally. More detailed information about these risk factors can be found in NewStar's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), including Item 1A (""Risk Factors"") of our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K, and as supplemented by any Risk Factors contained in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10--Q. NewStar is under no obligation to (and expressly disclaims any such obligation to) update or alter its forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law. NewStar plans to file its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 with the SEC on or before August 9, 2017 and urges its shareholders to refer to that document for more complete information concerning NewStar's financial results. Non-GAAP Financial Measures References to ""total revenue"" refer to net interest income plus non-interest income. ""Adjusted operating expenses"" refers to operating expenses, excluding severance costs and compensation expense related to restricted stock grants that are required to be included under GAAP. NewStar management uses adjusted operating expenses to analyze performance in support of operational and investment decisions, and NewStar believes that these measurements provide useful information to investors in their evaluation of our financial performance and condition. Excluding non-recurring items from revenue measures and excluding expenses incurred in connection with severance costs and compensation expense related to equity awards each eliminate unique amounts that make it difficult to assess our core performance and compare our period over period results.
