AAMC,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Our Company We were incorporated in the United States Virgin Islands on March 15, 2012. In October 2013, we applied for and were granted registration by the SEC as a registered investment adviser under section 203(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. We operate in a single segment focused on providing asset management and certain corporate governance services to institutional investors. Our primary client currently is Front Yard, a publicly-traded REIT focused on acquiring and managing quality, affordable SFR properties for America's families. Front Yard is currently our primary source of revenue and will drive our results. Since we are heavily reliant on revenues earned from Front Yard, investors may obtain additional information about Front Yard in its SEC filings, including, without limitation, Front Yard's financial statements and other important disclosures therein, available at http://www.sec.gov and http://ir.frontyardresidential.com/financial-information. Our strategy for Front Yard is to build long-term shareholder value through the creation of a large portfolio of SFR homes that are targeted to operate at an attractive yield. We believe there is a compelling opportunity in the SFR market and that we have implemented the right strategic plan for Front Yard to capitalize on the sustained growth in single-family rental demand. We target the moderately priced single-family home market for Front Yard that, in our view, offers attractive yield opportunities for Front Yard that should benefit AAMC in the form of growing management fees as Front Yard continues to grow. Prior to January 1, 2016, we had concluded that Front Yard was a VIE that we consolidated in our consolidated financial statement. Effective January 1, 2016, we adopted the provisions of ASU 2015-02, and we determined that Front Yard is no longer a VIE under the amended guidance. As a result, effective January 1, 2016, we no longer consolidate the accounts of Front Yard. Due to the significance of Front Yard's accounts to the Company's historical consolidated financial statements, the comparability of the Company's consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2017 have limited comparability with periods ending on or before December 31, 2015. Additionally, our wholly owned subsidiary, NewSource, is a title insurance and reinsurance company licensed with the Bermuda Monetary Authority. NewSource commenced reinsurance activities during the second quarter of 2014. In December 2014, NewSource determined that the economics of the initial business did not warrant the continuation of its initial reinsurance quota share agreement with an unrelated third party. NewSource therefore transferred all of the risk of claims and future losses underwritten to an unrelated third party, and its reinsurance and insurance business has been dormant since that time. We consolidate NewSource in our consolidated financial statements. Management Overview During fiscal year 2017, we continued to make substantial progress in guiding Front Yard's transformation into a 100% SFR equity REIT by continuing to focus on Front Yard's strategic objectives of (i) identifying and acquiring SFR properties with attractive yields; (ii) completing the sale of the vast majority of Front Yard's mortgage loans and non-rental REO properties that do not meet Front Yard's rental criteria; and (iii) extending the duration of Front Yard's financing arrangements to better match the long-term nature of its rental portfolio. Front Yard's Acquisitions in 2017 On March 30, 2017, we facilitated Front Yard's agreement to acquire up to 3,500 SFR (the ""HOME Flow Transaction"") from entities sponsored by Amherst Holdings, LLC (""Amherst""). In March, June and November 2017, Front Yard acquired an aggregate of 3,465 SFR properties under the HOME Flow Transaction in three separate closings: In the first closing on March 30, 2017, Front Yard's indirect wholly owned subsidiary, HOME SFR Borrower II, LLC (""HOME Borrower II""), acquired 757 SFR properties for an aggregate purchase price of $106.5 million. In the second closing on June 29, 2017, Front Yard's indirect wholly owned subsidiary, HOME SFR Borrower III, LLC (""HOME Borrower III""), acquired 751 SFR properties for an aggregate purchase price of $117.1 million. In the third and final closing on November 29, 2017, Front Yard's indirect wholly owned subsidiary, HOME SFR Borrower IV, LLC (""HOME Borrower IV"") acquired 1,957 SFR properties for an aggregate purchase price of $305.1 million. Combined with Front Yard's other 2017 SFR acquisition activities and conversions of REO properties to SFR properties, the homes acquired in the HOME Flow transaction have increased Front Yard's total SFR portfolio by 39% from 8,603 homes at December 31, 2016 to 11,975 homes at December 31, 2017. Front Yard's Transformative Dispositions in 2017 As of December 31, 2017, Front Yard has completed the disposition of the vast majority of its remaining mortgage loans. During 2017, Front Yard sold an aggregate of 2,995 mortgage loans to third-party purchasers, resolved an additional 120 mortgage loans, and converted an aggregate of 248 mortgage loans to REO properties. As a result of these efforts, Front Yard's mortgage loan portfolio was reduced to 111 mortgage loans with a carrying value of $11.5 million and an aggregate unpaid principal balance of only $29.4 million at December 31, 2017. In addition, Front Yard has continued to make significant progress on the sale of its non-rental REO properties with an additional 1,710 of such properties sold during the year ended December 31, 2017. We expect Front Yard to continue to sell its remaining REO properties that do not meet its rental profile as soon as reasonably practicable based on market conditions. Optimization of Front Yard's Financing in 2017 We have continued our efforts to optimize Front Yard's financing structure. During 2017, we facilitated Front Yard's entry into the following financing arrangements that we believe better match the long-term nature of Front Yard's assets than the shorter-term repurchase and loan agreements historically used to finance its portfolios while providing Front Yard with protection against rising interest rates. On March 30, 2017, in connection with the first closing under the HOME Flow Transaction, Front Yard obtained approximately $79.9 million of proceeds from a seller financing arrangement (the ""HOME II Loan Agreement""), representing 75% of the aggregate purchase price. Initially, the HOME II Loan Agreement had an interest rate based on one-month LIBOR plus a fixed component spread of 2.75% and an initial maturity date of October 9, 2019, which Front Yard has the option to extend for three successive one-year periods, provided, among other things, that there is no event of default under the HOME II Loan Agreement on each maturity date. On November 13, 2017, the HOME II Loan Agreement was amended and restated to (i) increase the principal amount to $83.3 million, (ii) reduce the fixed component spread of the interest rate to 2.10% and (iii) change the initial maturity date to November 9, 2019. On April 6, 2017, Front Yard entered into a fixed rate, five-year credit and security agreement with an aggregate principal balance of $100.0 million (the ""Term Loan Agreement"") with American Money Management Corporation, as agent, on behalf of Great American Life Insurance Company and Great American Insurance Company as initial lenders, and each other lender added from time to time as a party to the Term Loan Agreement. On June 29, 2017, in connection with the second closing under the HOME Flow Transaction, Front Yard obtained approximately $87.8 million of proceeds from a seller financing arrangement (the ""HOME III Loan Agreement""), representing 75% of the aggregate purchase price. Initially, the HOME III Loan Agreement had an interest rate based on one-month LIBOR plus a fixed component spread of 2.30% and an initial maturity date of October 9, 2019, which Front Yard has the option to extend for three successive one-year periods, provided, among other things, that there is no event of default under the HOME III Loan Agreement on each maturity date. On November 13, 2017, the HOME III Loan Agreement was amended and restated to (i) increase the principal amount to $89.2 million, (ii) reduce the fixed component spread of the interest rate to 2.10% and (iii) change the initial maturity date to November 9, 2019. On November 29, 2017, in connection with the third and final closing under the HOME Flow Transaction, Front Yard obtained an aggregate of approximately $228.8 million of proceeds from two separate seller financing arrangements (collectively, the ""HOME IV Loan Agreements""), representing 75% of the aggregate purchase price. The HOME IV Loan Agreements have a fixed interest rate of 4.00% and a maturity date of December 9, 2022. In addition to these long-term facilities, on April 6, 2017, we managed Front Yard's amendment and restatement of its loan and security agreement with Nomura Corporate Funding Americas, LLC to, among other things, extend the termination date of the facility by one year to April 5, 2018. Lastly, we also managed Front Yard's amendment and extension of its repurchase facility (the ""CS Repurchase Agreement"") with Credit Suisse First Boston Mortgage Capital, LLC (""CS""). In connection therewith, certain of the financial covenants under the CS Repurchase Facility were updated to customary provisions to better reflect Front Yard's business, and the maturity date was extended to November 16, 2018. The aggregate maximum borrowing capacity of the CS Repurchase Facility remained unchanged at $350.0 million. We believe all of the foregoing developments continue to be critical to our strategy of building long-term stockholder value for Front Yard through the creation of a large portfolio of SFR homes that we target operating for Front Yard at an attractive yield. To the extent Front Yard is successful in implementing this strategy under our management, the fees we earn under the AMA should be positively impacted. Observations on Current Market Opportunities We believe there is a compelling opportunity in the SFR market and that we have implemented the right strategic plan for Front Yard to capitalize on the sustained growth in SFR demand. Front Yard targets the moderately-priced single-family home market to acquire rental units that, in our view, offer optimal yield opportunities. In the current market, tighter credit availability for lower-income buyers and the relative scarcity of institutional buyers and operators should result in reduced price competition for reasonably priced homes. We believe that, when combined with sustained renter demand for affordable homes, Front Yard's lower home acquisition costs and careful evaluation of capital expenditure requirements prior to acquisition will offer attractive yield opportunities. We view this as a significant differentiator for Front Yard. Asset Management Agreement with Front Yard Pursuant to the AMA, we design and implement Front Yard's business strategy, administer its business activities and day-to-day operations and provide corporate governance services, subject to oversight by Front Yard's Board of Directors. We are responsible for, among other duties: (1) performing and administering all of Front Yard's day-to-day operations; (2) defining investment criteria in Front Yard's investment policy in cooperation with its Board of Directors; (3) sourcing, analyzing and executing asset acquisitions, including the related financing activities; (4) analyzing and executing sales of REO properties and residential mortgage loans; (5) overseeing the Property Managers' renovation, leasing and property management of Front Yard's SFR properties; We provide Front Yard with a management team and support personnel who have substantial experience in the acquisition and management of residential rental properties and residential mortgage loans. Our management also has significant corporate governance experience that enables us to manage Front Yard's business and organizational structure efficiently. We have agreed not to provide the same or substantially similar services without the prior written consent of Front Yard's Board of Directors to any business or entity competing against Front Yard in (a) the acquisition or sale of SFR and/or REO properties, non-performing and re-performing mortgage loans or other similar assets; (b) the carrying on of an SFR business or (c) any other activity in which Front Yard engages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may engage in any other business or render similar or different services to any businesses engaged in lending or insurance activities or any other activity other than those described above. Further, at any time following Front Yard's determination and announcement that it will no longer engage in any of the above-described competitive activities, we would be entitled to provide advisory or other services to businesses or entities in such competitive activities without Front Yard's prior consent. On March 31, 2015, we entered into the AMA with Front Yard. The AMA, which became effective on April 1, 2015, provides for the following management fee structure: Base Management Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly base management fee equal to 1.5% of the product of (i) Front Yard's average invested capital (as defined in the AMA) for the quarter multiplied by (ii) 0.25, while it has fewer than 2,500 SFR properties actually rented (""Rental Properties""). The base management fee percentage increases to 1.75% of average invested capital while Front Yard has between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 2.0% of average invested capital while it has 4,500 or more Rental Properties; Incentive Management Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly incentive management fee equal to 20% of the amount by which Front Yard's return on invested capital (based on AFFO, defined as net income attributable to holders of common stock calculated in accordance with GAAP plus real estate depreciation expense minus recurring capital expenditures on all real estate assets owned by Front Yard) exceeds an annual hurdle return rate of between 7.0% and 8.25% (or 1.75% and 2.06% per quarter), depending on the 10-year treasury rate. To the extent Front Yard has an aggregate shortfall in its return rate over the previous seven quarters, that aggregate return rate shortfall gets added to the normal quarterly 1.75% return hurdle for the next quarter before we are entitled to an incentive management fee. The incentive management fee increases to 22.5% while Front Yard has between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 25% while it has 4,500 or more Rental Properties; and Conversion Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly conversion fee equal to 1.5% of the market value of assets converted into leased single-family homes by Front Yard for the first time during the quarter. Because Front Yard has more than 4,500 Rental Properties, we are entitled to receive a base management fee of 2.0% of Front Yard's invested capital and a potential incentive management fee percentage of 25% of the amount by which Front Yard exceeds its then-required return on invested capital threshold. Front Yard has the flexibility to pay up to 25% of the incentive management fee to us in shares of its common stock. Under the AMA, Front Yard reimburses us for the compensation and benefits of the General Counsel dedicated to Front Yard and certain other out-of-pocket expenses incurred on Front Yard's behalf. The AMA requires that we are the exclusive asset manager for Front Yard for an initial term of 15 years from April 1, 2015, with two potential five-year extensions, subject to Front Yard achieving an average annual return on invested capital of at least 7.0%. Under the AMA, neither party is entitled to terminate the AMA prior to the end of the initial term, or each renewal term, other than termination by (a) us and/or Front Yard ""for cause"" for certain events such as a material breach of the AMA and failure to cure such breach, (b) Front Yard for certain other reasons such as its failure to achieve a return on invested capital of at least 7.0% for two consecutive fiscal years after the third anniversary of the AMA or (c) Front Yard in connection with certain change of control events. If the AMA were terminated by Front Yard, our financial position and future prospects for revenues and growth would be materially adversely affected. Metrics Affecting Our Consolidated Results Subsequent to January 1, 2016 Subsequent to our deconsolidation of Front Yard effective January 1, 2016, our operating results are affected by various factors and market conditions, including the following: Revenues Our revenues primarily consist of quarterly fees due to us under the AMA, including a base management fee, an incentive management fee and a conversion fee as described above and reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses in our management of Front Yard's business. The base management fee is derived as a percentage of Front Yard's average invested capital, and the conversion fee is based on the number and value of mortgage loans and/or REO properties that Front Yard converts to rental properties for the first time in each period. The incentive management fee is directly dependent upon Front Yard's financial performance being in excess of a 7.0%-8.25% minimum return on invested capital and will vary with Front Yard's financial performance. Expense reimbursements we receive from Front Yard relate primarily to travel and other out-of-pocket expenses solely related to our management of Front Yard's business and the base salary, bonus, benefits and stock compensation, if any, solely of the general counsel dedicated to Front Yard. All other salary, bonus, benefits and stock compensation of AAMC's employees (other than Front Yard share-based compensation issued to them by Front Yard) are the responsibility of AAMC and are not reimbursed by Front Yard. In addition, we receive dividends on the shares of Front Yard common stock that we own, which we record as other income. The amount of dividends we receive will vary with Front Yard's financial performance, taxable income, liquidity needs and other factors deemed relevant by Front Yard's Board of Directors. Lastly, we recognize changes in the fair value of our holdings of Front Yard common stock as other comprehensive income or loss, which will be directly dependent upon fluctuations in the market price of Front Yard's common stock. Expenses Our expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits includes the base salaries, incentive bonuses, medical coverage, retirement benefits, relocation, non-cash share-based compensation and other benefits provided to our employees for their services. Legal and professional fees include services provided by third-party attorneys, accountants and other service providers of a professional nature. General and administrative expenses include costs related to the general operation and overall administration of our business as well as non-cash share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards to non-employees and Directors. Prior to January 1, 2016 Prior to our deconsolidation of Front Yard effective January 1, 2016, our operating results were heavily dependent upon Front Yard's operating results. Although our results continue to be heavily dependent on Front Yard's operating results, our reported consolidated results of operations for periods prior to January 1, 2016 consolidated the financial results of Front Yard, which were a significant component of our consolidated results. As a result of our deconsolidation of Front Yard, the results of operations in periods commencing on or after January 1, 2016 have limited comparability to periods prior to January 1, 2016. Front Yard's results are affected by various factors, some of which are beyond our control, and the Front Yard financial data that is no longer a part of our financial statements includes the following: Front Yard's Revenues Front Yard's revenues primarily consisted of the following: i. Rental revenues. Minimum contractual rents from leases were recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of the leases in residential rental revenues. Therefore, actual amounts billed in accordance with the lease during any given period may have been higher or lower than the amount of rental revenue recognized for the period. ii. Net realized gain on mortgage loans. Front Yard recorded net realized gains, including the reclassification of previously accumulated net unrealized gains, upon the liquidation of a loan, which may have consisted of short sale, third-party sale of the underlying property, refinancing or full debt pay-off of the loan. iii. Change in unrealized gains from the conversion of loans to REO. Upon conversion of loans to REO, Front Yard marked the properties to the then-most recent market value. The difference between the carrying value of the asset at the time of conversion and the then-most recent market value, based on broker price opinions (""BPOs""), was recorded in Front Yard's statement of operations as change in unrealized gain on mortgage loans. iv. Change in unrealized gains from the change in fair value of loans. After Front Yard's sub-performing and non-performing mortgage loans were acquired, the fair value of each loan was adjusted in each subsequent reporting period as the loan proceeded to a particular resolution (i.e., modification or conversion to real estate owned). As a loan approached resolution, the resolution timeline for that loan decreased and costs embedded in the discounted cash flow model for loan servicing, foreclosure costs and property insurance were incurred and removed from future expenses. The shorter resolution timelines and reduced future expenses each increased the fair value of the loan. The increase in the value of the loan was recognized in change in unrealized gain on mortgage loans in Front Yard's statements of operations. v. Net realized gain on real estate. REO properties that did not meet Front Yard's investment criteria were sold out of its taxable REIT subsidiary. The realized gain or loss recognized in financial statements reflects the net amount of realized and unrealized gains on sold REOs from the time of acquisition to sale completion. Front Yard's Expenses Front Yard's expenses primarily consisted of residential property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, selling costs and impairment, mortgage loan servicing, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, expense reimbursements as well as fees to us from Front Yard under the applicable asset management agreement. Residential property operating expenses were expenses associated with Front Yard's ownership and operation of rental properties, including expenses such as property management fees, expenses towards repairs, utility expenses on vacant properties, turnover costs, property taxes, insurance and HOA dues. Depreciation and amortization was a non-cash expense associated with the ownership of real estate, which was depreciated on a straight-line basis over a fixed life. Selling costs and impairment represented Front Yard's estimated and actual costs to sell a property or mortgage loan and an amount that represented the carrying amount over the estimated fair value less costs to sell. Mortgage loan servicing costs were primarily for servicing fees, foreclosure fees and advances of residential property insurance. Interest expense consisted of the costs to borrow money in connection with Front Yard's debt financing of its portfolios. General and administrative expenses consisted of the costs related to the general operation and overall administration of Front Yard's business. Under the previous asset management agreement, expense reimbursement consisted primarily of our employee salaries in direct correlation to the services they provide on Front Yard's behalf and other personnel costs and corporate overhead. Under the AMA, there are no general expense or salary reimbursements except for the compensation and benefits of the general counsel dedicated to Front Yard and certain other out-of-pocket expenses incurred on Front Yard's behalf. The fees from Front Yard consisted of compensation due from Front Yard under the applicable asset management agreement. Under the previous asset management agreement, fees due from Front Yard were based on the amount of cash available for distribution to its stockholders for each period. Under the AMA, the management fees we receive from Front Yard are based on a combination of a percentage of Front Yard's invested capital, a conversion fee for assets that convert to single-family rentals during each period and Front Yard's return on invested capital. The percentage payment on each of these metrics will vary based on Front Yard's number of leased properties. The fees due from Front Yard under the respective asset management agreements were eliminated in consolidation but increased our net income by reducing the amount of net income attributable to non-controlling interest. Summary Management Reporting Information Prior to our deconsolidation of Front Yard, we evaluated the operations of AAMC on a stand-alone basis in addition to evaluating our consolidated financial performance, which included the results of Front Yard and NewSource under U.S. GAAP. In evaluating our operating performance and managing our business, we considered the management fees and reimbursement of expenses paid to us by Front Yard as well as our stand-alone operating expenses. We maintained our internal management reporting on this basis. The following table presents our consolidating statement of operations, which is reconciled to U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the entries necessary to consolidate AAMC's subsidiaries, including, but not limited to, elimination of fees paid under the asset management agreement and reimbursed expenses, are reflected in the Consolidating Entries column. Upon our adoption of ASU 2015-02, we are no longer required to consolidate the results of Front Yard. Therefore, we do not present the table for periods beginning on or subsequent to January 1, 2016. The following tables include non-GAAP performance measures that we believe are useful to assist investors in gaining an understanding of the trends and operating results for our business on a stand-alone basis. This information should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, our financial results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP.

AAMC,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Our Company We operate in a single segment focused on providing asset management and certain corporate governance services to institutional investors. We were incorporated in the United States Virgin Islands (""USVI"") on March 15, 2012. We have also been a registered investment adviser under section 203(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 since October 2013. Our primary client currently is Altisource Residential Corporation (""RESI""), a publicly-traded real estate investment trust focused on acquiring and managing quality, affordable single-family rental (""SFR"") properties for working class families throughout the United States. As such, RESI is currently our primary source of revenue and drives our results. We provide services to RESI pursuant to an asset management agreement (the ""AMA""), under which we are the exclusive asset manager for RESI for an initial term of through March 31, 2030, with two potential additional five-year extensions. The AMA provides for a fee structure in which we are entitled to a base management fee, an incentive management fee and a conversion fee for loans and real estate owned (""REO"") properties that become rental properties during each quarter. Our strategy for RESI is to build long-term shareholder value through the creation of a large portfolio of SFR homes that are targeted to operate at a best-in-class yield. We believe there is a compelling opportunity in the single-family rental market and that we have implemented the right strategic plan for RESI to capitalize on the sustained growth in single-family rental demand. We target the moderately priced single-family home market for RESI that, in our view, offers optimal yield opportunities for RESI that should benefit AAMC in the form of growing management fees as RESI continues to grow. In order to achieve this goal for both RESI and AAMC, we have focused on (i) identifying and acquiring high-yielding SFR properties for RESI in pools or on a targeted, individual basis; (ii) working with RESI's property managers to implement a cost-effective and scalable property management structure; (iii) selling certain mortgage loans and non-rental REO properties for RESI that do not meet its targeted rental criteria, which generates cash that RESI may reinvest in acquiring additional SFR properties; (iv) resolving the remaining mortgage loans in RESI's portfolio, including the conversion of a portion of the underlying properties to rental units and (v) extending the duration of RESI's financing arrangements to better match the long-term nature of its rental portfolio. Since we are heavily reliant on revenues earned from RESI, investors may obtain additional information about RESI in its Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") filings, including, without limitation, RESI's financial statements and other important disclosures therein, available at http://www.sec.gov and http://ir.altisourceresi.com/financials.cfm. Additionally, our wholly owned subsidiary, NewSource Reinsurance Company Ltd. (""NewSource""), is a title insurance and reinsurance company licensed with the Bermuda Monetary Authority. NewSource commenced reinsurance activities during the second quarter of 2014. In December 2014, NewSource determined that the economics of the initial business did not warrant the continuation of its initial reinsurance quota share agreement with an unrelated third party. NewSource therefore transferred all of the risk of claims and future losses underwritten to an unrelated third party, and its reinsurance and insurance business has been dormant since that time. We consolidate NewSource in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management Overview During the third quarter of 2017, we continued to focus on RESI's strategic objectives of identifying and acquiring high-yielding SFR properties and disposing of certain mortgage loans and non-rental REO properties in order for RESI to further build its SFR property portfolio. On March 30, 2017, we negotiated RESI's agreement to acquire up to 3,500 SFR properties (the ""HOME Flow Transaction"") from entities (the ""Sellers"") sponsored by Amherst Holdings, LLC (""Amherst"") in multiple closings. During the third quarter and the beginning of the fourth quarter of 2017, we evaluated RESI's acquisition of a portfolio of approximately 1,750 to 2,000 additional SFR properties from the Sellers in the Home Flow Transaction, and we anticipate that the final closing for that portfolio of properties will occur in the fourth quarter of 2017. Under our guidance, RESI also continued to make significant progress toward completing the disposition of its remaining mortgage loans by completing an auction process to sell a portfolio of 365 mortgage loans with an aggregate unpaid principal balance (""UPB"") of $85.2 million to an unrelated third party. The anticipated sale represents 83% of the UPB of the remaining mortgage loans in RESI's portfolio. Subject to typical confirmatory due diligence and negotiation of a definitive purchase agreement, we expect RESI to consummate this transaction during the fourth quarter of 2017. As is customary in these transactions, this confirmatory due diligence process may result in certain loans being removed from the sale or a repricing of certain loans; therefore, the final composition and proceeds of this portfolio sale are subject to adjustment depending on the final diligence results and further negotiation by the parties. No assurance can be given that this transaction will be completed on a timely basis or at all. The substantial majority of RESI's mortgage loans were previously sold during the first six months of 2017, and we expect RESI to have an insignificant number of mortgage loans remaining upon the completion of the anticipated sale. In addition, we have continued to assist RESI in making significant progress on the sale of its non-rental REO properties with an additional 450 and 1,385 of such properties sold during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. We expect RESI to continue to sell its remaining REO properties that do not meet its rental profile as soon as reasonably practicable based on market conditions. These mortgage loan and non-rental REO property sales continue to allow RESI to recycle capital that we expect will be utilized in the purchase of pools of stabilized rental homes at attractive yields, to repurchase common stock or for general corporate purposes. We expect RESI's continued divestiture of its remaining mortgage loans and non-rental REO properties will continue to have positive impacts on its results of operations. We are also in the process of negotiating a renewal and extension of RESI's repurchase facility with Credit Suisse (""CS"") maturing on November 18, 2017 for an additional year. Although we cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in renewing and extending the facility with CS, we expect RESI to renew and extend the CS repurchase facility on or prior to November 18, 2017. We believe the foregoing developments continue to be critical to our strategy of building long-term stockholder value for RESI through the creation of a large portfolio of SFR homes that we target operating for RESI at a best-in-class yield. To the extent RESI is successful in implementing this strategy under our management, the fees we earn under the AMA should be positively impacted. Asset Management Agreement with RESI Pursuant to the AMA, we design and implement RESI's business strategy, administer its business activities and day-to-day operations and provide corporate governance services, subject to oversight by RESI's Board of Directors. We are responsible for, among other duties: (1) performing and administering all of RESI's day-to-day operations; (2) defining investment criteria in RESI's investment policy in cooperation with its Board of Directors; We provide RESI with a management team and support personnel who have substantial experience in the acquisition and management of residential properties and residential mortgage loans. Both the management team and support personnel are employed exclusively by AAMC or affiliates thereof and are thus not employees of RESI. Our management also has significant corporate governance experience that enables us to manage RESI's business and organizational structure efficiently. We have agreed not to provide the same or substantially similar services without the prior written consent of RESI's Board of Directors to any business or entity competing against RESI in (a) the acquisition or sale of SFR and/or REO properties, non-performing and re-performing mortgage loans or other similar assets; (b) the carrying on of a single-family rental business or The AMA, which became effective on April 1, 2015, provides for a management fee structure as follows: Base Management Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly base management fee equal to 1.5% of the product of (i) RESI's average invested capital (as defined in the AMA) for the quarter multiplied by (ii) 0.25, while it has fewer than 2,500 single-family rental properties actually rented (""Rental Properties""). The base management fee percentage increases to 1.75% of invested capital while RESI has between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 2.0% of invested capital while it has 4,500 or more Rental Properties; Incentive Management Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly incentive management fee equal to 20% of the amount by which RESI's return on invested capital (based on AFFO, defined as net income attributable to holders of common stock calculated in accordance with GAAP plus real estate depreciation expense minus recurring capital expenditures on all real estate assets owned by RESI) exceeds an annual hurdle return rate of between 7.0% and 8.25% (or 1.25% and 2.06% per quarter), depending on the 10-year treasury rate. To the extent RESI has an aggregate shortfall in its return rate over the previous seven quarters, that aggregate return rate shortfall gets added to the normal quarterly return hurdle for the next quarter before we are entitled to an incentive management fee. The incentive management fee increases to 22.5% while RESI has between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 25% while it has 4,500 or more Rental Properties; and Conversion Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly conversion fee equal to 1.5% of the market value of assets converted into leased single-family homes by RESI for the first time during the applicable quarter. Because RESI has more than 4,500 Rental Properties, we are entitled to receive a base management fee of 2.0% of RESI's invested capital and a potential incentive management fee percentage of 25% of the amount by which RESI exceeds its then-required return on invested capital threshold. RESI has the flexibility to pay up to 25% of the incentive management fee to us in shares of its common stock. Under the AMA, RESI reimburses us for the compensation and benefits of the General Counsel dedicated to RESI and certain other out-of-pocket expenses incurred on RESI's behalf. The AMA requires that we are the exclusive asset manager for RESI for an initial term of 15 years from April 1, 2015, with two potential five-year extensions, subject to RESI achieving an average annual return on invested capital of at least 7.0%. RESI's termination rights under the AMA are significantly limited. Neither party is entitled to terminate the AMA prior to the end of the initial term, or each renewal term, other than termination by (a) us and/or RESI ""for cause"" for certain events such as a material breach of the AMA and failure to cure such breach, (b) RESI for certain other reasons such as its failure to achieve a return on invested capital of at least 7.0% for two consecutive fiscal years after the third anniversary of the AMA or (c) RESI in connection with certain change of control events. No incentive management fee was due from RESI for the third quarter of 2017 because RESI's return on invested capital (as defined in the AMA) was below the cumulative required hurdle rate. Under the AMA, to the extent RESI has an aggregate shortfall in its return rate over the previous seven quarters, that aggregate return rate shortfall gets added to the normal quarterly 1.75% return hurdle for the next quarter before we are entitled to an incentive management fee. As of September 30, 2017, RESI's aggregate return shortfall under the AMA was approximately 57.30% of invested capital. As each quarter with a shortfall rolls off the trailing seven quarters, the aggregate shortfall will change by the difference in the quarter that rolls off versus the most recently completed quarter. If the AMA were terminated by RESI, our financial position and future prospects for revenues and growth would be materially adversely affected. Metrics Affecting our Consolidated Results Revenues Our revenues primarily consist of quarterly fees due to us under the AMA, including the base management fee, incentive management fee and conversion fee as described above and reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses directly related to RESI's business. The base management fee is derived as a percentage of RESI's average invested capital, and the conversion fee is based on the number and value of mortgage loans and/or REO properties that RESI converts to rental properties for the first time in each period. The incentive management fee is directly dependent upon RESI's financial performance being in excess of a 7.0%-8.25% minimum return on invested capital and will vary with RESI's financial performance. Expense reimbursements we receive from RESI relate primarily to travel and other out-of-pocket expenses solely related to our management of RESI's business and the base salary, bonus, benefits and stock compensation, if any, solely of the General Counsel dedicated to RESI. All other salary, bonus, benefits and stock compensation of AAMC's employees (other than RESI share-based compensation issued to them by RESI) are the responsibility of AAMC and are not reimbursed by RESI. In addition, we receive dividends on the shares of RESI common stock that we own, which we record as other income. The amount of dividends on RESI's common stock will vary with RESI's financial performance, taxable income, liquidity needs and other factors deemed relevant by RESI's Board of Directors. In addition, we recognize changes in the fair value of our holdings of RESI common stock as other comprehensive income or loss, which will be directly dependent upon fluctuations in the market price of RESI's common stock. Expenses Our expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits include the base salaries, incentive bonuses, medical coverage, retirement benefits, relocation, non-cash share-based compensation and other benefits provided to our employees for their services. Legal and professional fees include services provided by third-party attorneys, accountants and other service providers of a professional nature. General and administrative expenses include costs related to the general operation and overall administration of our business as well as non-cash share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards to non-employees and Directors. Results of Operations The following sets forth discussion of our results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016. Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 Compared to Three and Nine Months Ended September 30, 2016 Management Fees and Expense Reimbursements Pursuant to the AMA, we received base management fees from RESI of $4.0 million and $12.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to $4.2 million and $12.8 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. The decrease in base management fees is primarily driven by declines in RESI's average invested capital, partially offset by increases in the base management fee percentage under the AMA related to the increase in RESI's portfolio of Rental Properties. We received conversion fees from RESI of $0.2 million and $1.2 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to $0.5 million and $1.4 million during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. We expect the conversion fees we receive to fluctuate dependent upon the number and fair market value of properties converted to Rental Properties for the first time during the quarter. We expect reductions in the amount of conversion fees we receive as RESI's portfolios of mortgage loans and REO properties decline. Because RESI has more than 4,500 Rental Properties, we are entitled to receive a base management fee of 2% of RESI's invested capital and a potential incentive management fee percentage of 25% of the amount by which RESI exceeds its then-required return on invested capital threshold. We recognized expense reimbursements due from RESI of $0.3 million and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to $0.2 million and $0.6 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively. Expense reimbursements relate primarily to travel and other out-of-pocket costs in managing RESI's business and the employment costs related to the General Counsel dedicated to RESI. Salaries and Employee Benefits Salaries and employee benefits were $5.0 million and $4.5 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in salaries and benefits in 2017 is primarily due to increases in employee headcount, partially offset by reduced share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants to management. Salaries and employee benefits were $15.0 million and $13.1 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in salaries and benefits in 2017 is primarily due to increases in employee headcount, partially offset by reduced share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants to management. The 2017 amount also includes $0.6 million related to dividends declared and paid by the Board of Directors on the preferred stock issued to our USVI employees under our 2016 Employee Preferred Stock Plan. Legal and Professional Fees Legal and professional fees were $0.9 million and $0.4 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase is primarily due to increased activity in the City of Cambridge litigation related to Plaintiff's appeal of the court's decisions in favor of Defendants and general corporate activities. Legal and professional fees were $1.9 million and $1.5 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase is primarily due to increased activity in the City of Cambridge litigation related to Plaintiff's appeal of the court's decisions in favor of Defendants and general corporate activities. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were $0.8 million and $1.2 million during the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to decreased share-based compensation expense related to non-employee awards that became fully vested during the second quarter of 2017. General and administrative expenses were $2.7 million and $3.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to decreased share-based compensation expense related to non-employee awards that became fully vested during the second quarter of 2017. Dividend Income on RESI Common Stock Dividends received on shares of RESI common stock decreased to $0.2 million and $0.7 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, from $0.2 million and $0.8 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, respectively, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a special dividend that was declared by RESI only in the first quarter of 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $32.8 million compared to $40.6 million as of December 31, 2016. At September 30, 2017, we also had $18.0 million in RESI common stock, compared to $17.9 million in RESI common stock as of December 31, 2016, due to the increase in RESI's stock price during the first nine months of 2017. We also continue to generate asset management fees from RESI under our AMA. We believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term (one year) liquidity requirements since we are continuing to generate asset management fees under the AMA and receive dividend income on the RESI common stock we own. Our only ongoing cash expenditures are salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional fees, lease obligations and other general and administrative expenses. Treasury Shares At September 30, 2017, a total of $265.5 million in shares of our common stock had been repurchased under the authorization by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $300.0 million in shares of our common stock. Repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes. We have an aggregate of $34.5 million remaining for repurchases under our Board-approved repurchase plan. Cash Flows We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated ($ in thousands): Nine months ended Nine months ended September 30, 2017 September 30, 2016 Net cash used in operating activities $ (2,323 ) $ (3,049 ) Net cash used in investing activities (1) - (132,290 ) Net cash used in financing activities (5,448 ) (7,312 ) Total cash flows $ (7,771 ) $ (142,651 ) ____________  Net cash used in operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of payment of salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional fees, lease obligations and other general and administrative expenses. We had no investing cash flows during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Net cash used in investing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 consisted primarily of our purchases of the common stock of RESI and a reduction of reported cash due to the deconsolidation of RESI effective January 1, 2016. Net cash used in financing activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of repurchases of our common stock. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of September 30, 2017 or December 31, 2016. Contractual Obligations On April 16, 2015, we entered into a lease with respect to office space located at 5100 Tamarind Reef, Christiansted, VI 00820. The lease has an initial term of five years from the date the premises are first occupied, and we have an option to extend the lease for an additional five-year term. The annual rent during the initial five-year term under the lease is $120,000, which increases to $130,800 per annum during the renewal term. Initially, the landlord was required to make renovations and build offices in the premises under the lease. During the renovation period, the landlord provided us with approximately 4,000 square feet of temporary space at a rent of $4,000 per month. During July 2017, the renovations were completed, and we occupied the office space effective July 24, 2017, which is the commencement date of the initial five-year term of the lease. In addition, we entered into a lease of approximately 5,700 square feet of office space in Bangalore, India for the employees of our India subsidiary. The lease, which commenced on December 16, 2015, has an initial term of five years and requires monthly payments of 291,159 Indian rupees (approximately $4,400 United States dollars).  Payments Due by Period Total Less than 1 Year 1 to 3 Years 3 to 5 Years More than 5 Years Operating leases (1) $ 748,396 $ 173,187 $ 346,374 $ 228,835 $ - $ 748,396 $ 173,187 $ 346,374 $ 228,835 $ - _______________  Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Item 1 - Financial statements (unaudited) - ""Note 1.

AAMC,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Our Company We operate in a single segment focused on providing asset management and certain corporate governance services to institutional investors. We were incorporated in the United States Virgin Islands (""USVI"") on March 15, 2012. In October 2013, we applied for and were granted registration by the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") as a registered investment adviser under section 203(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Our primary client currently is Altisource Residential Corporation (""RESI""), a publicly-traded real estate investment trust focused on acquiring and managing quality, affordable single-family rental (""SFR"") properties for working class families throughout the United States. RESI is currently our primary source of revenue and drives our results. We provide services to RESI pursuant to an asset management agreement (the ""AMA"") under which are the exclusive asset manager for RESI for an initial term of 15 years from April 1, 2015, with two potential five-year extensions. The AMA provides for a fee structure in which we are entitled to a base management fee, an incentive management fee and a conversion fee for loans and real estate owned (""REO"") properties that become rental properties during each quarter. Our strategy for RESI is to build long-term shareholder value through the creation of a large portfolio of SFR homes that are targeted to operate at a best-in-class yield. We believe there is a compelling opportunity in the single-family rental market and that we have implemented the right strategic plan for RESI to capitalize on the sustained growth in single-family rental demand. We target the moderately priced single-family home market for RESI which, in our view, offers optimal yield opportunities for RESI that should benefit AAMC in the form of growing management fees as RESI continues to grow. In order to achieve this goal for both RESI and AAMC, we have focused on (i) identifying and acquiring high-yielding SFR properties for RESI in pools or on a targeted, individual basis; (ii) working with RESI's property managers to implement a cost-effective and scalable property management structure; (iii) selling certain mortgage loans and non-rental REO properties for RESI that do not meet its targeted rental criteria, which generates cash that RESI may reinvest in acquiring additional SFR properties; (iv) resolving the remaining mortgage loans in RESI's portfolio, including the conversion of a portion of the underlying properties to rental units and (v) extending the duration of RESI's financing arrangements to better match the long-term nature of our rental portfolio. Additionally, we provide management services to our wholly owned subsidiary, NewSource Reinsurance Company Ltd. (""NewSource""), a title insurance and reinsurance company in Bermuda. On December 2, 2013, NewSource became registered as a licensed reinsurer with the Bermuda Monetary Authority. NewSource commenced reinsurance activities during the second quarter of 2014. In December 2014, NewSource determined that the economics of the initial business did not warrant the continuation of its initial reinsurance quota share agreement with an unrelated third party. NewSource therefore transferred all of the risk of claims and future losses underwritten to an unrelated third party, and its reinsurance and insurance business has been dormant since that time. We consolidate NewSource in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management Overview During the second quarter of 2017, we made substantial progress on RESI's strategic objectives through continued SFR property acquisitions, the sale of the majority of its mortgage loans and the disposition of non-rental REO properties. On June 29, 2017, we negotiated and consummated RESI's second closing under its previously disclosed agreement to acquire up to 3,500 SFR properties (the ""HOME Flow Transaction"") from entities (the ""Sellers"") sponsored by Amherst Holdings, LLC (""Amherst"") in multiple closings. In this second closing, RESI's indirect wholly owned subsidiary, HOME SFR Borrower III, LLC (""HOME Borrower III""), acquired 751 SFR properties for an aggregate purchase price of $117.1 million. To date, RESI has acquired 1,508 SFR properties pursuant to the HOME Flow Transaction, including the 757 SFR properties acquired by its indirect wholly owned subsidiary, HOME SFR Borrower II, LLC (""HOME Borrower II"") on March 30, 2017. The purchase price of the second closing was funded with approximately $87.8 million in a seller financing arrangement representing 75% of the aggregate purchase price (the ""HOME III Loan Agreement""). The HOME III Loan Agreement is a floating rate loan, composed of eight floating rate components, interest on each of which is computed monthly based on one-month LIBOR plus a fixed component spread. The entire principal amount is currently allocable to one component at a fixed-rate spread over one-month LIBOR, which is anticipated to be the weighted average fixed rate spread for the duration of the HOME III Loan Agreement. The initial maturity date of the HOME III Loan Agreement is October 9, 2019. HOME Borrower III has the option to extend the HOME III Loan Agreement beyond the initial maturity date for three successive one-year extensions, provided, among other things, that there is no event of default under the HOME III Loan Agreement on each maturity date. In connection with both closings under the HOME Flow Transaction, RESI again retained Main Street Renewal, LLC (""MSR""), the current property manager for the portfolio, to provide property management services for the acquired rental homes, including leasing and lease management, operations, maintenance, repair, property management and property disposition services. We believe that RESI's property management agreements with MSR and Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. are, and will continue to be, key drivers of efficiency and cost management in RESI's model. We believe such agreements will also provide RESI with scalable, established, geographically dispersed property management infrastructures to support its growing portfolio of SFR properties. During the second quarter of 2017, we also continued RESI's efforts to recycle capital through the sale of certain mortgage loans and non-rental REO properties. We advised RESI on the successful completion of the sale of 2,104 mortgage loans during May 2017, bringing the total NPLs sold by RESI in bulk transactions to 2,660 for the first six months of 2017. As of June 30, 2017, RESI has sold the substantial majority of its non-performing and re-performing loans. In addition, we have continued to assist RESI in making significant progress on the sale of its non-rental REO properties with an additional 522 and 935 of such properties sold during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. These mortgage loan and non-rental REO property sales continue to allow RESI to recycle capital to purchase pools of stabilized rental homes at attractive yields, to repurchase common stock or to utilize the proceeds for such other purposes as RESI determines will best serve its stockholders. We have continued our efforts to optimize RESI's financing structure. In addition to securing the HOME III Loan Agreement in June 2017, we also facilitated RESI's entry, on April 6, 2017, into a fixed rate, five-year credit and security agreement with an aggregate principal balance of $100.0 million (the ""Term Loan Agreement""). The majority of the proceeds of the Term Loan Agreement were used to reduce RESI's balances on certain of its other short-term repurchase and loan agreements. We believe that the Term Loan Agreement, together with the seller financing arrangements obtained under the HOME Flow Transaction, better matches the long term nature of RESI's assets than the shorter term repurchase and loan agreements historically used to finance its portfolios while providing RESI with protection against rising interest rates. Additionally, on April 6, 2017, we facilitated RESI's amendment and restatement of its loan and security agreement with Nomura Corporate Funding Americas, LLC to, among other things, extend the termination date of the facility by one year to April 5, 2018. We believe the foregoing developments are critical to our strategy of building long-term stockholder value for RESI through the creation of a large portfolio of SFR homes that we target operating for RESI at a best-in-class yield. To the extent RESI is successful in implementing this strategy under our management, the fees we earn under the AMA should be positively impacted. Asset Management Agreement with RESI Pursuant to the AMA, we design and implement RESI's business strategy, administer its business activities and day-to-day operations and provide corporate governance services, subject to oversight by RESI's Board of Directors. We are responsible for, among other duties: (1) performing and administering all of RESI's day-to-day operations; (2) defining investment criteria in RESI's investment policy in cooperation with its Board of Directors; We provide RESI with a management team and support personnel who have substantial experience in the acquisition and management of residential properties and residential mortgage loans. Both the management team and support personnel are employed exclusively by AAMC or affiliates thereof and are thus not employees of RESI. Our management also has significant corporate governance experience that enables us to manage RESI's business and organizational structure efficiently. We have agreed not to provide the same or substantially similar services without the prior written consent of RESI's Board of Directors to any business or entity competing against RESI in (a) the acquisition or sale of SFR and/or REO properties, non-performing and re-performing mortgage loans or other similar assets; (b) the carrying on of a single-family rental business or different services to any businesses engaged in lending or insurance activities or any other activity other than those described above. Further, at any time following RESI's determination and announcement that it will no longer engage in any of the above-described competitive activities, we would be entitled to provide advisory or other services to businesses or entities in such competitive activities without RESI's prior consent. The AMA, which became effective on April 1, 2015, provides for a management fee structure as follows: Base Management Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly base management fee equal to 1.5% of the product of (i) RESI's average invested capital (as defined in the AMA) for the quarter multiplied by (ii) 0.25, while it has fewer than 2,500 single-family rental properties actually rented (""Rental Properties""). The base management fee percentage increases to 1.75% of invested capital while RESI has between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 2.0% of invested capital while it has 4,500 or more Rental Properties; Incentive Management Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly incentive management fee equal to 20% of the amount by which RESI's return on invested capital (based on AFFO, defined as net income attributable to holders of common stock calculated in accordance with GAAP plus real estate depreciation expense minus recurring capital expenditures on all real estate assets owned by RESI) exceeds an annual hurdle return rate of between 7.0% and 8.25% (depending on the 10-year treasury rate). The incentive management fee increases to 22.5% while RESI has between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 25% while it has 4,500 or more Rental Properties; and Conversion Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly conversion fee equal to 1.5% of the market value of assets converted into leased single-family homes by RESI for the first time during the applicable quarter. Because RESI has more than 4,500 rented properties, we are entitled to receive a base management fee of 2.0% of RESI's invested capital and a potential incentive management fee percentage of 25% of the amount by which RESI exceeds its then-required return on invested capital threshold. To the extent RESI has an aggregate shortfall in its return rate over the previous seven quarters, that aggregate return rate shortfall gets added to the normal quarterly 1.75% return hurdle for the next quarter before we are entitled to an incentive management fee. RESI has the flexibility to pay up to 25% of the incentive management fee to us in shares of its common stock. Under the AMA, RESI reimburses us for the compensation and benefits of the general counsel dedicated to RESI and certain other out-of-pocket expenses incurred on RESI's behalf. The AMA requires that we are the exclusive asset manager for RESI for an initial term of 15 years from April 1, 2015, with two potential five-year extensions, subject to RESI achieving an average annual return on invested capital of at least 7.0%. RESI's termination rights under the AMA are significantly limited. Neither party is entitled to terminate the AMA prior to the end of the initial term, or each renewal term, other than termination by (a) us and/or RESI ""for cause"" for certain events such as a material breach of the AMA and failure to cure such breach, (b) RESI for certain other reasons such as its failure to achieve a return on invested capital of at least 7.0% for two consecutive fiscal years after the third anniversary of the AMA or (c) RESI in connection with certain change of control events. No incentive management fee was due from RESI for the second quarter of 2017 because RESI's return on invested capital (as defined in the AMA) was below the cumulative required hurdle rate. Under the AMA, to the extent RESI has an aggregate shortfall in its return rate over the previous seven quarters, that aggregate return rate shortfall gets added to the normal quarterly 1.75% return hurdle for the next quarter before we are entitled to an incentive management fee. As of June 30, 2017, RESI's aggregate return shortfall under the AMA was approximately 60.40% of invested capital. As each quarter with a shortfall rolls off the trailing seven quarters, the aggregate shortfall will change by the difference in the quarter that rolls off versus the most recently completed quarter. If the AMA were terminated by RESI, our financial position and future prospects for revenues and growth would be materially adversely affected. Metrics Affecting our Consolidated Results Revenues Our revenues primarily consist of quarterly fees due to us under the AMA, including the base management fee, incentive management fee and conversion fee as described above and reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses directly related to RESI's business. The base management fee is derived as a percentage of RESI's average invested capital, and the conversion fee is based on the number and value of mortgage loans and/or REO properties that RESI converts to rental properties for the first time in each period. The incentive management fee is directly dependent upon RESI's financial performance being in excess of a 7.0%-8.25% minimum return on invested capital and will vary with RESI's financial performance. Expense reimbursements we receive from RESI relate primarily to travel and other out-of-pocket expenses solely related to our management of RESI's business and the base salary, bonus, benefits and stock compensation, if any, solely of the general counsel dedicated to RESI. All other salary, bonus, benefits and stock compensation of AAMC's employees (other than RESI share-based compensation issued to them by RESI) are the responsibility of AAMC and are not reimbursed by RESI. In addition, we receive dividends on the shares of RESI common stock that we own, which we record as other income. The amount of dividends on RESI's common stock will vary with RESI's financial performance, taxable income, liquidity needs and other factors deemed relevant by RESI's Board of Directors. In addition, we recognize changes in the fair value of our holdings of RESI common stock as other comprehensive income or loss, which will be directly dependent upon fluctuations in the market price of RESI's common stock. Expenses Our expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits include the base salaries, incentive bonuses, medical coverage, retirement benefits, relocation, non-cash share-based compensation and other benefits provided to our employees for their services. Legal and professional fees include services provided by third-party attorneys, accountants and other service providers of a professional nature. General and administrative expenses include costs related to the general operation and overall administration of our business as well as non-cash share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards to non-employees and Directors. Results of Operations The following sets forth discussion of our results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Compared to Three and Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Management Fees and Expense Reimbursements Pursuant to the AMA, we received base management fees from RESI of $4.0 million and $8.2 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to $4.5 million and $8.6 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. The decrease in base management fees is primarily driven by declines in RESI's average invested capital, partially offset by increases in the base management fee percentage under the AMA related to the increase in RESI's rental portfolio. We received conversion fees from RESI of $0.4 million and $1.0 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to $0.5 million and $0.9 million during the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively. We expect the conversion fees we receive to fluctuate dependent upon the number and fair market value of properties converted to rented properties for the first time during the quarter. Because RESI has more than 4,500 rented properties, we are entitled to receive a base management fee of 2% of RESI's invested capital and a potential incentive management fee percentage of 25% of the amount by which RESI exceeds its then-required return on invested capital threshold. We recognized expense reimbursements due from RESI of $0.2 million and $0.4 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to $0.4 million for each of the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Expense reimbursements relate primarily to travel and other out-of-pocket costs in managing RESI's business and the employment costs related to the general counsel dedicated to RESI. Salaries and Employee Benefits Salaries and employee benefits were $5.3 million and $4.4 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in salaries and benefits in 2017 is primarily due to increases in employee headcount, partially offset by reduced share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants to management. Salaries and employee benefits were $10.0 million and $8.6 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in salaries and benefits in 2017 is primarily due to increases in employee headcount, partially offset by reduced share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants to management. The 2017 amount also includes $0.6 million related to dividends declared and paid by the Board of Directors on the preferred stock issued to our USVI employees under our 2016 Employee Preferred Stock Plan. Legal and Professional Fees Legal and professional fees were $0.3 million and $0.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in legal fees related to a reduction in the preparation and filing of motions related to the City of Cambridge class action, which was dismissed with prejudice during the second quarter of 2017. Legal and professional fees were $1.0 million and $1.1 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease is primarily due to a decrease in legal fees related to a reduction in the preparation and filing of motions related to the City of Cambridge class action, which was dismissed with prejudice during the second quarter of 2017. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were $0.7 million and $1.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to decreased share-based compensation expense related to non-employee awards. General and administrative expenses were $1.9 million and $2.2 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This decrease was primarily due to decreased share-based compensation expense related to non-employee awards. Dividend Income on RESI Common Stock Dividends received on shares of RESI common stock decreased to $243 thousand and $487 thousand for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, from $244 thousand and $536 thousand for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016, respectively, primarily due to the non-recurrence of a special dividend declared by RESI in the first quarter of 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of June 30, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $31.7 million compared to $40.6 million as of December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017, we also had $21.0 million in RESI common stock, compared to $17.9 million in RESI common stock as of December 31, 2016, due to the increase in RESI's stock price during the first six months of 2017. We also continue to generate asset management fees from RESI under our AMA. We believe that these sources of liquidity will be sufficient to enable us to meet anticipated short-term (one year) liquidity requirements since we are continuing to generate asset management fees under the AMA and receiving dividend income on the RESI common stock we own and our only ongoing cash expenditures are salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional fees, lease obligations and other general and administrative expenses. Treasury Shares At June 30, 2017, a total of $265.5 million in shares of our common stock had been repurchased under the authorization by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $300.0 million in shares of our common stock. Repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes. We have an aggregate of $34.5 million remaining for repurchases under our Board-approved repurchase plan. Cash Flows We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. The following table sets forth our cash flows for the periods indicated ($ in thousands): Six months ended June Six months ended June 30, 2017 30, 2016 Net cash used in operating activities $ (3,477 ) $ (6,250 ) Net cash used in investing activities (1) - (132,290 ) Net cash used in financing activities (5,455 ) (6,585 ) Total cash flows $ (8,932 ) $ (145,125 ) ____________  Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of payment of salaries, annual incentive compensation, dividends on preferred stock issued to employees, legal and professional fees, lease obligations and other general and administrative expenses. We had no investing cash flows during the six months ended June 30, 2017. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 consisted primarily of our purchases of the common stock of RESI and a reduction of reported cash due to the deconsolidation of RESI effective January 1, 2016. Net cash used in financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily repurchases of our common stock. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of June 30, 2017 or December 31, 2016.

AAMC,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations Our Company We operate in a single segment focused on providing asset management and certain corporate governance services to institutional investors. We were incorporated in the United States Virgin Islands (""USVI"") on March 15, 2012. In October 2013, we applied for and were granted registration by the Securities and Exchange Commission (""SEC"") as a registered investment adviser under section 203(c) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Our primary client currently is Altisource Residential Corporation (""RESI""), a publicly-traded real estate investment trust (""REIT"") focused on acquiring and managing quality, affordable single-family rental (""SFR"") properties for working class families throughout the United States. RESI is currently our primary source of revenue and drives our results. We provide services to RESI pursuant to an asset management agreement (the ""AMA"") under which we will be the exclusive asset manager for RESI for an initial term of 15 years from April 1, 2015, with two potential five-year extensions. The AMA provides for a fee structure in which we are entitled to a base management fee, an incentive management fee and a conversion fee for loans and real estate owned (""REO"") properties that become rental properties during each quarter. Our strategy for RESI is to build long-term shareholder value for it through the creation of a large portfolio of SFR homes that are targeted to operate at a best-in-class yield. We believe there is a compelling opportunity in the single-family rental market and that we have implemented the right strategic plan for RESI to capitalize on the sustained growth in single-family rental demand. We target the moderately priced single-family home market for RESI which, in our view, offers optimal yield opportunities for RESI that should benefit AAMC in the form of growing management fees as RESI continues to grow. In order to achieve this goal for both RESI and AAMC, we have focused on (i) identifying and acquiring high-yielding SFR properties for RESI in pools or on a targeted, individual basis; (ii) working with RESI's property managers to implement a cost-effective and scalable property management structure; (iii) selling certain mortgage loans and non-rental REO properties for RESI that do not meet its targeted rental criteria, which generates cash that RESI may reinvest in acquiring additional SFR properties; (iv) resolving the remaining mortgage loans in RESI's portfolio, including the conversion of a portion of the underlying properties to rental units and (v) extending the duration of RESI's financing arrangements to better match the long-term nature of our rental portfolio. Additionally, we provide management services to NewSource. On December 2, 2013, NewSource became registered as a licensed reinsurer with the Bermuda Monetary Authority. We consolidate NewSource in our condensed consolidated financial statements. Management Overview During the first quarter of 2017, we made substantial progress on RESI's strategic objectives. On March 30, 2017, we facilitated RESI's entry into an agreement to acquire up the 3,500 SFR properties (the ""HOME II Transaction"") from entities sponsored by Amherst Holdings, LLC (""Amherst"") in multiple closings. In the first closing on March 30, 2017, RESI's indirect wholly owned subsidiary acquired 757 SFR properties for an aggregate purchase price of $106.5 million. RESI also committed to purchase up to 2,743 additional stabilized rental properties from the sellers in the HOME II Transaction, 1,250 of which are subject to the sellers' good faith efforts to offer such properties for sale. The purchase price was funded by RESI with approximately $79.9 million of proceeds from a seller financing arrangement (the ""HOME II loan agreement,"") representing 75% of the aggregate purchase price (the ""HOME II Loan""), which, along with the Term Loan (as defined below), advanced RESI's objective of obtaining longer term financing arrangements for its assets. The HOME II Loan is a floating rate loan, on which interest is computed monthly based on one-month LIBOR plus a fixed component spread of 2.75%, which is anticipated to be the weighted average fixed rate spread for the duration of the HOME II loan agreement. The initial maturity date of RESI's HOME II Loan is October 9, 2019, and we negotiated the option for RESI to extend the HOME II Loan for three successive one-year periods, provided, among other things, that there is no event of default under the HOME II loan agreement on each maturity date. The HOME II Loan is secured by the membership interests of HOME Borrower II and the properties and other assets of HOME Borrower II. In connection with the HOME II Transaction, RESI again retained Main Street Renewal, LLC (""MSR""), the current property manager for the portfolio to provide property management services for the acquired rental homes, including leasing and lease management, operations, maintenance, repair, property management and property disposition services. We believe the two separate property management agreements with MSR and Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. are, and will continue to be, key drivers of efficiency and cost management in RESI's model. We believe such agreements will also provide RESI with scalable, established, geographically dispersed property management infrastructures to support its growing portfolio of SFR properties and promote better data for RESI and best practices for RESI's property management structure. During the first quarter of 2017, we also continued RESI's efforts to recycle capital through the sale of certain mortgage loans and non-rental REO properties. We advised RESI on the successful completion of the sale of 556 mortgage loans during the three months ended March 31, 2017. In addition, in January 2017, we commenced an auction process for RESI to sell an additional portfolio of 2,384 mortgage loans with an aggregate UPB of $574.4 million. On February 15, 2017, following the auction process, we facilitated RESI's agreement in principle to award the sale to an unrelated third party. Subject to typical confirmatory due diligence and final negotiation of the definitive purchase agreement, we expect RESI to consummate this transaction during the second quarter of 2017. Following completion of the sale of this additional mortgage loan portfolio, RESI will have sold the substantial majority of its non-performing and re-performing loans that were not expected to be rental candidates. In addition, we have continued to assist RESI in making significant progress on the sale of its non-rental REO properties with an additional 413 of such properties sold during the first quarter of 2017. These mortgage loan and non-rental REO property sales have allowed, and will continue to allow, RESI to recycle capital to purchase pools of stabilized rental homes at attractive yields, to repurchase common stock or to utilize the proceeds for such other purposes as RESI determines will best serve its stockholders. We have continued our efforts to optimize RESI's financing structure to best benefit its strategic objectives and long-term structure. In addition to securing the HOME II Loan in March 2017, we also facilitated RESI's entry, on April 6, 2017, into a fixed rate, five year credit and security agreement (the ""Term Loan Agreement"") with an aggregate principal balance of $100.0 million (the ""Term Loan""). The majority of the proceeds of the Term Loan were used to reduce RESI's balances on certain of its other short-term repurchase and loan agreements. We believe that the Term Loan, together with the HOME II Loan, better matches the long term nature of RESI's assets than the shorter term repurchase and loan agreements historically used to finance its portfolios while providing RESI with protection against rising interest rates. Additionally, on April 6, 2017, we facilitated RESI's amendment and restatement of its loan and security agreement with Nomura Corporate Funding Americas, LLC to, among other things, extend the termination date of the facility by one year to April 5, 2018. We believe the foregoing developments are critical to our strategy of building long-term stockholder value for RESI through the creation of a large portfolio of SFR homes that we target operating for RESI at a best-in-class yield. To the extent RESI is successful in implementing this strategy under our management, the fees we earn under the AMA should be positively impacted. Asset Management Agreement with RESI Pursuant to the AMA, we design and implement RESI's business strategy, administer its business activities and day-to-day operations and provide corporate governance services, subject to oversight by RESI's Board of Directors. We are responsible for, among other duties: (1) performing and administering all of RESI's day-to-day operations; (2) defining investment criteria in RESI's investment policy in cooperation with its Board of Directors; We provide RESI with a management team and support personnel who have substantial experience in the acquisition and management of residential properties and residential mortgage loans. Our management also has significant corporate governance experience that enables us to manage RESI's business and organizational structure efficiently. We have agreed not to provide the same or substantially similar services without the prior written consent of RESI's Board of Directors to any business or entity competing against RESI in (a) the acquisition or sale of SFR and/or REO properties, non-performing and re-performing mortgage loans or other similar assets; (b) the carrying on of a single-family rental business or (c) any other activity in which RESI engages. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we may engage in any other business or render similar or different services to any businesses engaged in lending or insurance activities or any other activity other than those described above. Further, at any time following RESI's determination and announcement that it will no longer engage in any of the above-described competitive activities, we would be entitled to provide advisory or other services to businesses or entities in such competitive activities without RESI's prior consent. The AMA, which became effective on April 1, 2015, provides for a management fee structure as follows: Base Management Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly Base Management Fee equal to 1.5% of the product of (i) RESI's average invested capital (as defined in the AMA) for the quarter multiplied by (ii) 0.25, while it has fewer than 2,500 single-family rental properties actually rented (""Rental Properties""). The Base Management Fee percentage increases to 1.75% of invested capital while RESI has between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 2.0% of invested capital while it has 4,500 or more Rental Properties; Incentive Management Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly Incentive Management Fee equal to 20% of the amount by which RESI's return on invested capital (based on AFFO, defined as net income attributable to holders of common stock calculated in accordance with GAAP plus real estate depreciation expense minus recurring capital expenditures on all real estate assets owned by RESI) exceeds an annual hurdle return rate of between 7.0% and 8.25% (depending on the 10-year treasury rate). The Incentive Management Fee increases to 22.5% while RESI has between 2,500 and 4,499 Rental Properties and increases to 25% while it has 4,500 or more Rental Properties; and Conversion Fee. We are entitled to a quarterly Conversion Fee equal to 1.5% of the market value of assets converted into leased single-family homes by RESI for the first time during the applicable quarter. To the extent RESI has an aggregate shortfall in its return rate over the previous seven quarters, that aggregate return rate shortfall gets added to the normal quarterly 1.75% return hurdle for the next quarter before we are entitled to an Incentive Management Fee. RESI has the flexibility to pay up to 25% of the Incentive Management Fee to us in shares of its common stock. Under the AMA, RESI reimburses us for the compensation and benefits of the general counsel dedicated to RESI and certain other out-of-pocket expenses incurred on RESI's behalf. The AMA requires that we are the exclusive asset manager for RESI for an initial term of 15 years from April 1, 2015, with two potential five-year extensions, subject to RESI achieving an average annual return on invested capital of at least 7.0%. RESI's termination rights under the AMA are significantly limited. Neither party is entitled to terminate the AMA prior to the end of the initial term, or each renewal term, other than termination by (a) us and/or RESI ""for cause"" for certain events such as a material breach of the AMA and failure to cure such breach, (b) RESI for certain other reasons such as its failure to achieve a return on invested capital of at least 7.0% for two consecutive fiscal years after the third anniversary of the AMA or (c) RESI in connection with certain change of control events. No Incentive Management Fee was due from RESI for the first quarter of 2017 because RESI's return on invested capital (as defined in the AMA) was below the required hurdle rate. Under the AMA, to the extent RESI has an aggregate shortfall in its return rate over the previous seven quarters, that aggregate return rate shortfall gets added to the normal quarterly 1.75% return hurdle for the next quarter before we are entitled to an Incentive Management Fee. As of March 31, 2017, RESI's aggregate return shortfall under the AMA was approximately 55.60% of invested capital. As each quarter with a shortfall rolls off the trailing seven quarters, the aggregate shortfall will change by the difference in the quarter that rolls off versus the most recently completed quarter. If the AMA were terminated by RESI, our financial position and future prospects for revenues and growth would be materially adversely affected. Metrics Affecting our Consolidated Results Revenues Our revenues primarily consist of quarterly fees due to us under the AMA, including the Base Management Fee, Incentive Management Fee and Conversion Fee as described above and reimbursements of out-of-pocket expenses directly related to RESI's business. The Base Management Fee is derived as a percentage of RESI's average invested capital, and the Conversion Fee is based on the number and value of mortgage loans and/or REO properties that RESI converts to rental properties for the first time in each period. The Incentive Management Fee is directly dependent upon RESI's financial performance being in excess of a 7.0%-8.25% minimum return on invested capital and will vary with RESI's financial performance. Expense reimbursements we receive from RESI relate primarily to travel and other out-of-pocket expenses solely related to our management of RESI's business and the base salary, bonus, benefits and stock compensation, if any, solely of the general counsel dedicated to RESI. All other salary, bonus, benefits and stock compensation of AAMC's employees (other than RESI share-based compensation issued to them by RESI) are the responsibility of AAMC and are not reimbursed by RESI. In addition, we receive dividends on the shares of RESI common stock that we own, which we record as other income. The amount of dividends on RESI's common stock will vary with RESI's financial performance, taxable income, liquidity needs and other factors deemed relevant by RESI's Board of Directors. In addition, we recognize changes in the fair value of our holdings of RESI common stock as other comprehensive income or loss, which will be directly dependent upon fluctuations in the market price of RESI's common stock. Expenses Our expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses. Salaries and employee benefits includes the base salaries, incentive bonuses, medical coverage, retirement benefits, relocation, non-cash share-based compensation and other benefits provided to our employees for their services. Legal and professional fees include services provided by third-party attorneys, accountants and other service providers of a professional nature. General and administrative expenses include costs related to the general operation and overall administration of our business as well as non-cash share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock awards to non-employees and Directors. Results of Operations The following sets forth discussion of our results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 Compared to Three Months Ended March 31, 2016 Management Fees and Expense Reimbursements We received total management fees from RESI under the AMA of $4.8 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017, consisting of $4.2 million of Base Management Fees and $0.6 million of Conversion Fees, compared to $4.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016, consisting of $4.1 million of Base Management Fees and $0.4 million of Conversion Fees. The increase in Base Management Fees is primarily driven by an increase in the Base Management Fee percentage under the AMA, partially offset by declines in RESI's average invested capital for the quarter. The increase in Conversion Fees is primarily driven by an increased number of properties converted to rented properties for the first time during the first quarter of 2017 compared to the first quarter of 2016. Because RESI has more than 4,500 rented properties, we are entitled to receive a Base Management Fee of 2% of RESI's invested capital and a potential Incentive Management Fee percentage of 25% of the amount by which RESI exceeds its then-required return on invested capital threshold. We recognized expense reimbursements due from RESI of $0.2 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 related to travel and other out-of-pocket costs in managing RESI's business and the employment costs of related to the general counsel dedicated to RESI. Salaries and Employee Benefits Salaries and employee benefits was $4.7 million and $4.2 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase in salaries and benefits in 2017 is primarily due to increases in employee headcount, partially offset by reduced share-based compensation expense related to restricted stock grants to management. The $4.7 million in 2017 also includes $0.6 million related to dividends declared and paid by the Board of Directors on the preferred stock issued to our USVI employees under our 2016 Employee Preferred Stock Plan. Legal and Professional Fees Legal and professional fees were $0.7 million during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $0.5 million during the three months ended March 31, 2016. This increase is primarily due to an increase in legal fees related to motion practice in our ongoing litigation as well as fees of outside counsel representing the Board of Directors in a shareholder matter that ultimately did not move forward. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were $1.2 million and $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. This increase was primarily due to increased share-based compensation expense related to the increase in the fair value of non-employee awards. Dividend Income on RESI Common Stock Dividends received on shares of RESI common stock decreased to $0.2 million from $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, primarily due to the non-recurrence in 2017 of a special dividend declared by RESI in the first quarter of 2016. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of March 31, 2017, we had cash and cash equivalents of $30.9 million compared to $40.6 million as of December 31, 2016. We believe this cash is sufficient to fund our operations since we are continuing to generate asset management fees under the AMA and receiving dividend income on the RESI common stock we own and our only ongoing cash expenditures are lease obligations, salaries and employee benefits, legal and professional fees and general and administrative expenses, which are covered by the Base Management Fees we receive under the AMA. Treasury Shares At March 31, 2017, a total of $264.5 million in shares of our common stock had been repurchased under the authorization by our Board of Directors to repurchase up to $300.0 million in shares of our common stock. Repurchased shares are held as treasury stock and are available for general corporate purposes. We have an aggregate of $35.5 million remaining for repurchases under our Board-approved repurchase plan. Cash Flows We report and analyze our cash flows based on operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. The following table sets forth the actual cash flows for the periods indicated ($ in thousands): Three months ended March Three months ended 31, 2017 March 31, 2016 Net cash used in operating activities $ (5,800 ) $ (8,279 ) Net cash used in investing activities (1) - (132,290 ) Net cash used in financing activities (3,929 ) (2,329 ) Total cash flows $ (9,729 ) $ (142,898 ) ____________  Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily of payment of salaries, annual incentive compensation and dividends on preferred stock issued to employees and a net decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities. We had no investing cash flows during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 consisted primarily of our purchases of the common stock of RESI and a reduction of reported cash due to the deconsolidation of RESI effective January 1, 2016. Net cash used in financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 consisted primarily repurchases of our common stock. Off-balance Sheet Arrangements We had no off-balance sheet arrangements as of March 31, 2017 or December 31, 2016.

AAMC,"CHRISTIANSTED, U.S. Virgin Islands, May 09, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Altisource Asset Management Corporation (""AAMC"" or the ""Company"") (nyse mkt:AAMC) today announced financial and operating results for the first quarter of 2017. First Quarter 2017 Highlights and Recent Developments Negotiated Altisource Residential Corporation's (""RESI"") definitive agreement to purchase up to 3,500 rental homes in a seller financed transaction; completed first closing of 757 properties in March 2017. [1] Completed RESI's sale of 556 mortgage loans to a third party. Negotiated RESI's expected sale of up to 2,384 mortgage loans with an aggregate UPB of $574.4 million to a third party. [2] Sold 413 non-rental REO properties for RESI. Advised RESI on a new $100.0 million five-year term loan with a fixed 5.0% interest rate, collateralized by residential rental properties. Amended and extended RESI's $250.0 million loan and security agreement with Nomura, demonstrating the continued support of lenders. Completed repurchases of $4.0 million of AAMC common stock, bringing total repurchases under AAMC's repurchase program to approximately $264.5 million. ""We are proud of the substantial growth of RESI's single-family rental portfolio under our management.  We are continuing to build RESI's acquisition channels, deliver strong rental operating metrics and guide RESI's divestiture of legacy loan and REO assets in favor of high-yielding single-family rental properties,"" stated Chief Executive Officer, George Ellison. ""These continued achievements on behalf of RESI are important in delivering long-term value for AAMC's shareholders."" _____________________________ [1 ] Second closing is scheduled to occur in the second quarter of 2017 and is subject to continuing due diligence, inspection of homes and finalization of pricing. [2 ] Closing is scheduled to occur in May 2017, subject to execution of definitive purchase agreement and completion of final due diligence.  Certain loans may not be sold in the closing due to their conversion to REO or diligence findings; therefore, the total number of sold loans will be less than 2,384. First Quarter 2017 Financial Results AAMC's net loss for the first quarter of 2017 totaled $1.3 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $0.9 million, or $0.50 per diluted share, for the first quarter of 2016.
