The most compelling reason is that transactions near the top of the cycle, especially after a year struggling to keep our head above water, mean it’s better to step aside and let the extra volatility burn itself off.

OEF,"If this wasn’t made clear by Tuesday’s sucker punch, the stock market certainly seems to be entering a harsher, more volatile trading climate. It’s been a couple months since investors have been stung this hard, but don’t let your guard down thinking another two will go by without another blow like this. “We are likely to see the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -3.07%  move precipitously up or down 200 points with greater frequency,” warns David Kotok of Cumberland Advisors. “Why not? Two hundred points is only about 1%. Contrast that with the Russell 2000 index RUT, -2.62%  which lost 10% since its summer peak.” Speaking of the Russell, the worrisome theme of small-cap underperformance is dominating much of the discourse these days. As it should. The divergence from the broader market won’t last forever. The man behind our chart of the day has been hitting this angle hard lately, especially as it relates to the similarities this market shares with 2007’s pending disaster. Regardless of whether or not stocks face an imminent retreat, investors, as evidenced by the steady climb up the market-cap ladder, have been circling the wagons. But they’re not doing it with gold, obviously. There doing it by getting in bed with big names and trusty track records. Jon Krinsky of MKM Partners says the issue is “extremely important at the current juncture”, and he laid out the direct correlation between market cap and performance. So far this year, micro caps IWC, -2.75%  are down 8%, small caps IWM, -2.84%  off 5.8%, mid caps MDY, -3.07%  up 1.3%, large caps SPY, -3.13%  up 6.3% and mega caps OEF, -3.35%  up 6.7%. If that’s not enough to give you night sweats, beware the dreaded “trap door” as we embark on this pivotal earnings season. It could sneak up under you (more on that below). Key market gauges Futures on the Dow US:YMZ4  and the S&P US:ESZ4  are pointing to small losses yesterday’s thrashing. Asia ADOW, +0.22%  struggled to get anything going in a positive direction, while Europe SXXP, +0.44%  is down now and emerging markets are also in the dumps. Gold US:GCZ4  is getting another lift from all the equity selling. The dollar DXY, +0.01%  is also pulling back. The quote of the day “I probably under-shifted to one or two things, and I feel bad about that. I don’t feel bad about social networking. Good for Facebook FB, -3.27% great, but I don’t feel bad [that we missed it]. I feel a little differently about search, and a little differently about phones. We should have done better. I feel worse about phones than I do about search.” -- Steve Ballmer, in an interview on Vanity Fair.

Here’s why being a biotech is like getting dropped into a shark tank. The chart of the day If you’ve hung around this space before -- or really, any number of blogs and newsletters -- you are aware of just how pronounced the move away from small caps into the relative security of large caps has been. This chart from Charlie Bilello illustrates the point nicely as part of his fantastic series of charts showing how the current situation is frighteningly similar to another pivotal moment in stock market history. “As was the case in October 2007, on the surface all is calm today. But unfortunately, this is not the only similarity between the two periods,” he said. “Lurking underneath the surface, like the submarine Red October, are potentially dangerous divergences in cyclical sector weakness, small cap weakness, and junk bond weakness.” Read the full blog here The call of the day Move over “value trap” and “liquidity trap”. Here’ comes the “trap door”, an unpleasant scenario that Mark St. Cyr warns we better get used to as we head into earnings season. “Wall Street loves to spout nice little catch phrases when suddenly what they thought (or told) investors should happen suddenly turns around and does something else,” he said. St. Cyr brought up CNBC’s Jim Cramer, claiming the “talking head has done more damage to the individual investor... than almost any other single person.” Look no further than his ill-timed recommendation of GT Advanced Technologies US:GTAT St. Cyr waved the red flag specifically on the social media sector, home to Facebook FB, -3.27%  and Twitter TWTR, -2.95% He said he believes this will be among the hardest-hit areas in this earnings period as QE dries up at a time when these companies need “free money” more than ever. “If this proves to be the case the term ‘trap door’ will not be used in reference to some new gaming app available,” he said. “It will be to describe serious consequences to people who assumed investing in these markets has been nothing more than a game to be played by ‘players.’” Random reads “If I die, then I die.

OEF,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Investors are being given a chance to buy shares of better-known, higher-quality U.S. businesses at discount prices, according to an analyst at investment researcher Morningstar Inc. who pens a monthly report on exchange-traded funds. ""The market's biggest names have sported compelling valuation traits for much of 2007, and June's sell-off made them even more attractive,"" wrote Sonya Morris in the July installment of her subscription newsletter. To implement this view, the analyst recommended a somewhat lesser-known ETF that targets the 50 largest stocks listed in the U.S. by market capitalization. The Rydex Russell Top 50 ETF XLG, -3.16% follows an investment strategy implied by its ticker symbol -- investing in ""extra-large"" companies. The fund levies a razor-thin expense ratio of 0.2% and had $621.6 million in assets late last week, according to sponsor Rydex Investments. The ETF's straightforward approach represents a concentrated bet on so-called mega-cap stocks, which is why Morris chose it rather than other U.S. large-cap ETFs such as iShares S&P 100 OEF, -3.10% SPDR S&P 500 ETF SPY, -2.94% and iShares Russell 1000 IWB, -3.00% ""The higher you move up the market-cap ladder, the more attractive the valuations get,"" Morris said in a telephone interview. The Rydex Russell Top 50 ETF, she added, provides a ""laser focus on the largest, blue-chip stocks."" Rydex Russell Top 50 ETF was up 6.7% this year through July 20, lagging the broader Standard & Poor's 500 Index SPX, -3.02% by about 2.5 percentage points, according to Morningstar. Small-cap stocks have outperformed their bigger peers the past few years, but large caps have been closing the gap as the rally presses on. Late last week, a popular U.S. small-cap ETF, iShares Russell 2000 IWM, -2.80% was up 8.8% for the year so far but slightly trailed the S&P 500. Picturing portfolios While many ETF newsletters are geared to market timers and based on technical analysis of market trends, Morningstar's Morris employs an approach that analyzes the stocks a fund holds. She determines a valuation measure for each ETF that compares an underlying stock's price to what Morningstar's equity analysts consider its fair value. ""We view ETFs through the prism of our stock analysis, and try to identify ETFs that hold a slug of undervalued stocks,"" Morris explained. She has constructed two model ETF portfolios: ""hands-free"" and ""hands-on."" The hands-free version is for investors ""who don't have the time or inclination to spend a lot of time every week looking after their portfolios,"" Morris said. The goal is to assemble a low-cost, diversified portfolio that can almost be ""set and forget."" Meanwhile, the hands-on portfolio is a more aggressive compilation, geared to active investors who are comfortable with its higher frequency of ETF buying and selling. Morris declined a request to publish the holdings and allocations of the two model portfolios in this story, since the newsletter is for subscribers. She did, however, discuss recent moves in the portfolios and her views on specific sectors and ETFs. For example, the Rydex Russell Top 50 ETF was added to the hands-free version, which she called a ""rare trade."" In this portfolio, she may rebalance a position back to the original weighting if it gets 10 percentage points or more from a target allocation. The higher-turnover hands-on model is more likely to make a trade for valuation changes, Morris said. ""I'm not averse to turnover if an ETF moves in our favor quickly after buying, and I'm happy to sell,"" she added. Sector spin In the hands-on portfolio, some of the newsletter's recent picks have seen ups and downs. One of the biggest disappointments has been a home-builder ETF, iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction ITB, -4.18% a position that was opened on March 12. The ETF has been battered by a worsening housing market and the subprime-mortgage mess, and for the three months ended July 19 it was off 13.4%. Mea culpa, writes Morris. ""This has been the most frustrating pick in the model portfolios,"" she acknowledged, but notes that she's hanging tough on this selection. If anything, she says, the slide in the home-builder sector has made valuations even more appealing. ""And while the fundamentals certainly aren't cheerful, I think the market has overreacted,"" she wrote in the latest newsletter. ""Historically, these stocks have bottomed out somewhere around book value, and that's where they are right now,"" Morris added. ""Granted, I didn't fully anticipate the extent to which the blowup in subprime lending would weigh on home-builder stocks."" The group could take another hit this week with many of the largest companies set to report quarterly results, and Morris said this holding ""will require the most patience of any."" In contrast, an energy ETF, iShares Dow Jones U.S. Oil & Gas Exploration & Production IEO, -4.37% has been a winner since it was added to the hands-on portfolio in March. Morris said the ETF's run has pushed valuations and it could be a sell candidate down the line. For now, she's ""just keeping an eye on it"" and notes that Morningstar analysts have boosted their outlook for natural-gas prices. The newest additional to the model is Consumer Staples Select Sector SPDR XLP, -2.60% which was purchased on May 31. Morris likes the market-cap weighted approach this ETF employs, since it takes bigger positions in the larger stocks where Morningstar currently sees the most value. The ETF's holdings include consumer blue-chips Proctor & Gamble Co. PG, -2.57% Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -4.35% Coca-Cola Co. KO, -1.87% PepsiCo Inc. PEP, -2.08% and Walgreen Co. WAG Some of these companies also pay healthy dividends -- a bonus to their attractive valuations, Morris said. Fitting in with the mega-cap and value themes, iShares S&P Global Healthcare IXJ, -2.64% also finds a place in the hands-on portfolio. This ETF's top holdings include Johnson & Johnson JNJ, -3.18% Pfizer Inc. PFE, -1.69% GlaxoSmithKline PLC GSK, -1.02% and Novartis AG NVS, -1.63% Morris said she likes this healthcare ETF's worldwide flavor, since ""companies look cheap across the globe"" and ""it's less relevant where they're headquartered."" Elsewhere in sectors, she said insurers, utilities and retailer stocks present some bargains, but overall the valuations don't make these ETFs compelling buys. One concentrated sector ETF that came into the portfolio in March was KBW Bank ETF KBE, -2.94% The fund was slightly in the red as of the publication of the July newsletter. Morris said the ETF represents a way to buy financials stocks while avoiding real estate investment trusts, which she sees as overvalued after a multiyear run. She said big multinational banks such as Citigroup Inc. C, -0.73% and J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -3.13% look attractively priced, as do regional banks such as US Bancorp USB, -2.51% and BB&T Corp. BBT, -3.25% Said Morris: ""Big banks don't get cheap all that often, so we picked up wide-moat banks with a sizable margin of safety.""
