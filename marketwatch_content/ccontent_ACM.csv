ACM,"Look alive out there this morning, because it’s looking like a big day for stocks. The Dow has busted out to a new record near 26,000 as traders come back from the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday, seemingly eager to dive back into this rally. It’s the opposite for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, which may be in the throes of a “Black Monday”-style selloff: We’re kicking off with the chart of the day, which is timely as several tech stocks like Netflix NFLX, +3.35%  and Amazon AMZN, +1.11% are making headway this morning. The subject of that chart is one investor favorite — Apple AAPL, +0.78%  , which broke out to a new all-time high on Friday of $177.09. The chart comes from MKM Partners’ chief market technician, Jonathan Krinsky: MKM Partners/Bloomberg Apple may have just ignited its chances of becoming the first trillion-dollar company, driven by a strong trend and momentum, points out Krinsky in a note to clients. Krinsky notes that in Friday’s action, 33% of the S&P 500 components hit a 52-week high — the most in nearly five years. He warns this often means some kind of short-term pullback for stocks. And that’s where Apple comes in. He says it’s one stock that still has potential to run higher, even given the strong leg-up equities have experienced so far this year. Focus on “strong long-term trends that have been in near-term consolidations, and therefore are not short-term overbought,” Krinsky advises. Among the other stocks that he says fit the bill: AECOM ACM, +2.59%  , Disney DIS, +1.93%  , MGM MGM, +2.70%  , PPG PPG, +1.48%  , Terex TEX, +2.13%  and Ecolab ECL, +1.30% Overall, investors should be on the lookout for some short-term consolidation for the S&P. “A 5% decline would simply test the rising 50 [daily moving average], certainly not out of the question,” Krinsky says. Read: Investors should be pessimistic about rising stock-market optimism Key market gauges The Dow DJIA, +1.07%  has opened at 26,000, with the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%   and Nasdaq COMP, +1.64%  also well into the green. Asia stocks have come back from a Monday slide, while European stocks SXXP, +0.44% are moving up, with a weaker euro cutting the index a break.

The chart One reason to buy commodities? They’re cheap relative to stocks. That’s the message in our call of the day from Justin Brill, blogging for Daily Wealth over the weekend. He notes that the Bloomberg Commodity Index is up 11% since bottoming in late June, with about half of those gains taking place over just the past four weeks. “Commodities have only been this cheap relative to stocks two other times in the past 50 years. And in both cases, commodities dramatically outperformed stocks over the next several years,” says Brill. The first time that happened was in the early ‘70s, just before the dollar had been taken off the gold standard, he notes. The second time was before the last melt-up for stocks during the dot-com boom. “What many folks don’t realize is that many commodities actually bottomed more than a year before the stock market peaked. And again, they trounced the stock market for years,” adds Brill. One way to play this comes from the blogger’s colleague Steve Sjuggerud, who recommends the iShares MSCI Global Metals & Mining Producers Fund PICK, +2.29%  , of which Rio Tinto RIO, +2.65%  and BHP Billiton BHP, +2.16%  are top holdings.

Also in deal news, IBM IBM, +0.60%  is up on a planned blockchain joint venture with global shipping giant Maersk MAERSKB, +1.15%  . And Long Blackchain LBCC, +0.38%  says it has entered into a letter of intent to merge with Stater Blockchain. UnitedHealth UNH, -2.06% is up after posting a profit beat, while Citi C, -1.11%  is also up, even though it lost $18.3 billion in the fourth quarter, owing to a tax charge.

ACM,"Norges Bank Investment Management, the arm of Norway's central bank that manages the country's $1.1 trillion oil fund, said Tuesday that it has excluded a further nine companies from the fund on ethical grounds. Among those excluded is U.K. weapons maker BAE Systems PLC because of its involvement in the production of nuclear weapons. Data from the end of 2016, the latest available, shows that the oil fund held a 1.47% stake in BAE Systems. AECOM, Fluor Corp. and Huntington Ingalls Industries Inc. have also been excluded for the same reason, while Honeywell International Inc.'s exclusion is maintained based on this criterion, it said. The Norwegian Ministry of Finance has issued specific guidelines for the oil fund with criteria for observation and exclusion endorsed by Norway's parliament. These criteria say the fund must not invest in companies which produce weapons that violate fundamental humanitarian principles through their normal use, produce tobacco, or sell weapons or military material to certain countries. Companies may also be excluded if there is an unacceptable risk of conduct that is considered grossly unethical. Norges Bank decides on the exclusion of companies from the fund's investments, or to place them on an observation list. Further exclusions announced Tuesday include Evergreen Marine Corp (Taiwan) Ltd, Korea Line Corp., Precious Shipping PCL and Thoresen Thai Agencies PCL due to the ""risk of severe environmental damage and serious or systematic violations of human rights."" Pan Ocean Co. has been placed under observation based on the same criteria while Atal SA has also been excluded due to unacceptable risk of serious or systematic violations of human rights, Norges Bank said. There are currently over 140 companies excluded from the fund and around 20 under observation. -Write to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com; Twitter: @domchopping @WSJNordics More from MarketWatch Can the Democrats Ride a Blue Wave to Midterm Election Wins?

ACM,"My sympathies go to those who have been hurt or displaced by hurricane Harvey. But even in the middle of this tragedy, the world will go on and, soon, rebuilding will begin. No wonder I am getting an inordinate amount of requests from investors regarding stocks that are affected by the hurricane. The basic principle For investors, the basic principle to understand is that everything is temporary. Stocks that fall tend to recover. Stocks that rise tend to give up some of their gains. Hurricanes typically don’t create many situations for investments, but many short-term trading opportunities do arise. How to trade Please click here for an annotated chart of insurer Travelers Cos. TRV, +0.05% stock. Historically, insurance stocks recover after a brief dip. The reason is that insurance companies often succeed in raising rates after storms. Read: These 15 energy stocks are down more than 3.5% in the wake of Hurricane Harvey To be consistently successful at a large number of trades over a long period of time, traders must look for good setups and refrain from overtrading. The chart shows that Travelers stock has fallen, but it doesn’t present a good trading setup at this time. A good setup would be if the relative strength index (RSI) drops below 20 on heavy volume and then tries to recover. Such an occurrence is marked on the chart. This is the kind of setup that is needed on most hurricane-related stocks to trade on the long side. For trades from the short side, the setup is similar, but look for a reversal of RSI from about 80.

ACM,"LOS ANGELES — Infrastructure and engineering firm Aecom is acquiring Shimmick Construction Company Inc. for $175 million, expanding its reach in the Western U.S. in anticipation of hundreds of billions of dollars in infrastructure spending expected in the coming years. Oakland, Calif.-based Shimmick has taken part in a number of infrastructure projects in the Western U.S., including improvements and repairs on the Golden Gate Bridge and public-transportation work in the San Francisco Bay Area and Honolulu. Aecom ACM, +2.59%   will take on the 27-year-old firm’s $1.35 billion project backlog, including a large project to replace a highway bridge near the Port of Long Beach. The Trump administration has proposed spending $200 billion over 10 years on infrastructure programs, with a goal of spurring a total of $1 trillion in financing with the inclusion of private investment. Those plans have fueled mergers and acquisitions in the infrastructure sector, as well as new interest from investors, including a planned $100 billion fund from Blackstone Group LP. In California and Washington, voters have passed ballot measures that call for nearly $180 billion in infrastructure investment, and the California legislature recently approved another $52 billion for road repairs. California’s infrastructure market is expected to grow in double digits annually for the next several years, and Aecom said it aims to capture as much of those funds as possible.

ACM,"President Trump says the Paris Agreement on climate change is bad for America. On Thursday, the president told a crowd in the White House Rose Garden, “It is time to put Youngstown, Ohio, Detroit, Michigan, and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania — along with many, many other locations within our great country — before Paris, France.” Not everyone agrees. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the decision “deeply regrettable” and said the deal to limit greenhouse emissions is critical to protect the planet and prevent further global warming. “We need this Paris accord to preserve our creation,” she said. “Nothing can and will stop us.” Even the mayor of Pittsburgh disagreed with Trump: Several other cities across the U.S. also vowed to uphold the agreement, despite Trump’s decision, including New York, Boston, Houston, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Atlanta. (Here’s a full list of the so-called “Climate Mayors.” One of these mayors was accused of hypocrisy by some, though. When asked about his 12-mile trip from Gracie Mansion in Manhattan to his Park Slope, Brooklyn gym in his SUV, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said, “It doesn’t really have anything to do with how we change the world,” he said. “We change the world with policies that affect people.” Don’t miss: Bottled water is now more popular than soda — why you should avoid both But Jonathan Harrington, author of “The Climate Diet: How You Can Cut Carbon, Cut Costs, and Save the Planet,” says every little bit counts. In his book, he gives out various “awards” to people who try to make a difference in their own lives. A “participant” award goes to anyone who does anything (like separate plastics and paper in the trash), followed by bronze, silver and gold medals. “The Climate Diet is about making small incremental changes in the way you, your family or your community inhabits this planet,” he writes. So how do you recreate the Paris climate change accord at home? It’s far from simple. With that in mind, MarketWatch provides some suggestions: 1. Solar-power your home with and without panels This is one way to reduce your reliance on fossil fuels, but there’s a problem. Solar power “must get significantly less expensive” to expand to a level that would contribute meaningfully to global carbon-reduction goals, according to a report, “The New Solar System,” released in March by economists at Stanford University. “China and the United States find themselves at an unprecedented moment in the growth of solar power,” the report found. “How they proceed will do much to determine whether solar energy emerges as a mainstream energy source and, in the process, as an engine of significant economic growth and carbon reductions.” Several U.S. states recently passed legislation to support community solar, which gives homeowners the chance to use solar power without using solar panels. It’s not cheap to install solar panels. It costs between $10,045 and $13,475 after tax credits to install a solar panel on a roof, which works out at between $2.87 and $3.85 per watt, according to estimates by green energy website EnergySage. However, that’s still 9% lower than a year ago, it added. Another low-cost option: Harness solar power without the actual roof panels. Several U.S. states recently passed legislation to support community solar, which gives homeowners the chance to use solar power by leasing or subscribe to a solar panel power source. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory, a Colorado-based government institution that conducts research and development in renewable energy and energy efficiency, estimates that almost half (49%) of U.S. households would like to go solar, but don’t have the kind of roof that would support solar power. And there are approximately 15.8 million homes in the U.S. that have the potential to go solar, according to GTM Research, the research arm of energy media company Greentech Media. —Quentin Fottrell 2. Watch your thermostat and shut off your lights If you can’t get solar panels installed on your roof, never fear — there are other options. Shutting off the lights, using energy-efficient appliances and keeping the thermostat not too high or low could also help reduce your carbon footprint at home, according to Carbon Offsets to Alleviate Poverty, a 501(c)(3) charity dedicated to reducing carbon emissions. Turning off a light or turning off the television when you leave the room reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 0.15 pounds per hour. Lighting uses about 25% of all electricity in the country, the Office of Sustainability at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., said. Turning off a light or turning off the television when you leave the room reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 0.15 pounds per hour, according to Boston University, which calculated that if everyone at the school turned off the light for one hour a day for an entire year, they’d save enough energy to match the equivalent of taking 97 cars off the road for a year. Also see: 1 in 4 deaths of children under the age of 5 are due to unhealthy environments Additionally, using a compact fluorescent bulb as opposed to a regular bulb will prevent thousands of pounds of carbon dioxide, and they last 10 times longer (so you save money, too), according to Tufts. The same method applies to thermostats — keeping your thermostat two degrees higher in the winter and two degrees lower in the summer could save 2,000 pounds of carbon dioxide per year, estimates by Oregon’s Clackamas County found. As for appliances, products with the Environmental Protection Agency’s Energy Star label support energy efficiency. These appliances, which range across numerous categories including washing machines and air purifiers, have reduced greenhouse gas emissions by more than 2.4 billion metric tons and saved Americans more than $362 billion on utility bills over the last 22 years, according to the EPA’s Energy Star site. —Alessandra Malito 3. Don’t paint your roof green, paint it white Wait, what? While a blue bathroom might score you money when you sell your house, painting your roof a certain hue will win points with Mother Earth — and also save you money. It’s not as crazy as it sounds. The simple step of painting your roof white helps reflect sunlight, which keeps the entire building cooler and can slash your power bill by 30%, say advocates with The White Roof Project. That may also help cut down on pricey air-conditioning bills in the summer months, which some estimates put at $120 per month (or more) for the average home. On top of that, the pale roofs help cut smog, because they lower the air temperature, which traps less pollution in our skies, according to The White Roof Project. The organization says painting 5% of rooftops worldwide would cut 24 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by 2034. And although it seems counter-intuitive, the white roof fix is three times more effective in fighting climate change than planting a green roof — the practice of covering a roof with grass and plants — researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found. But before you climb a ladder and slap a coat of white paint on your roof, check to make sure you’re using one with the proper reflective properties. —Leslie Albrecht 4. Car-share or just take public transportation Around 2.2 million U.S. workers have a daily commute of at least an hour to and from work, according to the “American Community Survey” by the U.S. Census, and 600,000 full-time workers are so-called super-commuters, spending 90 minutes and traveling 50 miles to get to work every day. The summertime is even worse for traffic: More than 80% of people who traveled 50 or more miles away from home over the Memorial Day Weekend — 34.6 million people — were on the roads. While coal-fired power plants are the biggest sources of greenhouse gases in the U.S., personal transportation comes in second and accounts for 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions. While coal-fired power plants are the biggest sources of greenhouse gases in the U.S., personal transportation comes in second and accounts for 20% of all greenhouse gas emissions, according to Rob Perks, transportation campaign director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a non-profit environmental advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. If 25% of the population adopted new driving behaviors like carpooling, greenhouse gas emissions could be cut by 3% to 12%, saving billions of gallons of fuel, and resulting in potential savings of billions of dollars each year in gas, the Natural Resources Defense Council study found. When one person commutes in a car, it doesn’t just add to carbon emissions, it’s also costly. The Natural Resources Defense Council found that commuters spend $2,180 a year on maintaining a car and paying for gas to get to and from work in urban areas and $3,347 in the suburbs, while rural commuters spend $4,272 a year. Those who don’t commute to work only spend $1,857 a year. —Quentin Fottrell 5. Stick to one bag for your groceries (forever) There’s no easy answer for some domestic environmental decisions. California banned stores from giving out free plastic, single-use bags last November, making it the first such state-wide ban at grocery checkout lines. Dozens of other cities around the country have also banned what environmentalists say have been the scourge of oceans for decades. In California, consumers have to pay at least 10 cents for a plastic bag provided by the supermarket or bring their own reusable bag to the store and, in several cities consumers must pay 10 cents to buy a paper bag (Los Angeles did so in 2014). Studies say the most common replacements for single-use plastic grocery bags — paper and reusable bags — come with environmental and financial costs of their own. The widespread use of single-use carry-out plastic bags raises significant environmental concerns, according to a 2010 report by professional technical-services company Aecom Technology Corp. ACM, +2.59% It cited the short and long term adverse effects to marine ecosystems, solid waste management, global resource consumption and litter. Many major retailers sell reusable bags in biodegradable canvas, plastic or “bioplastics” manufactured from natural materials, but some big-box retailers sell alternative bags that are made from plastic and shipped from as far afield as China, 7,000 miles away. Experts say their most common replacements — paper and reusable bags — come with environmental and financial costs of their own. Paper bags are biodegradable, but some experts say cutting down trees is no answer either. And some reusable bags need to be used over 100 times before they’re better for the environment than single-use plastic bags. Polyethylene bags need to be used four times, a polypropylene bag must be used at least 11 times, and a cotton bag must be used at least 131 times, according to a study by the U.K. Environment Agency. —Quentin Fottrell 6. Recycle, and be mindful of what you throw out Next time you get take-out or delivery, consider throwing some of that garbage in recyclables — you’d at least be helping to save the planet. In this case, every little bit does help: One ton of papers recycled saves 17 trees from being cut down, according to Do It Green, a Minnesotan sustainable living all-volunteer group — it also takes up 65% less energy than producing paper from scratch. Read also: The CDC issues warning about a nasty chlorine-resistant parasite lurking in swimming pools Recycling and waste reduction benefit the environment and reduce humans’ carbon footprint in a number of ways: it slows down deforestation (trees also breathe in carbon dioxide), lessens the energy required to manufacture various products (manufacturing recyclables still requires energy, but far less than what’s necessary to create items out of raw materials) and avoids emissions that come from landfills, according to the University of Michigan. The U.S. in particular recycles 32% of its waste, which is similar to removing almost 40,000 cars from the road. Building up landfills is partially preventable, and avoiding it would save the earth from products, like plastic, from remaining in those landfills for centuries. More than 250 million tons of solid waste were accumulated in the U.S. in 2014 — composed of food (21%), plastics (18%), paper (14%) and rubber, leather and other textiles (10%), the Environmental Protection Agency concluded. —Alessandra Malito 7. Lobby your school to stop using foam cafeteria trays School cafeteria lunches are often a nutritional nightmare for kids’ diets, and experts say the foam trays they’re served on aren’t much better for the planet’s health. They’re made of petroleum, they can’t be recycled and therefore clog landfills, and disposing of them with garbage trucks creates greenhouse gas emissions, according to Cafeteria Culture, a group that advocates for removing the foam trays from schools. Despite their toll on the environment, the trays are popular with school districts because they’re cheap — only 3.5 cents compared with a 15-cent eco-friendly alternative. Don’t miss: This is how most Americans would like to die Bad news for “Climate Mayors” like Bill de Blasio, New York City Mayor. His SUV ride to the gym pales in comparison to what schools in New York and elsewhere did in 2015. The school systems in five major cities including New York and Los Angeles banded together to replace the foam trays with ones made of compostable and biodegradable material. By buying in bulk — the school districts ordered 271 million at once — the districts lowered the cost to just 4 cents a tray. Parents who want to take similar steps in their local schools can get in touch with Cafeteria Culture for ideas on how to convince officials to make the switch., or some schools are even wealthy enough to buy their own replacement trays. —Leslie Albrecht 8. Bike to work and advocate for greener transportation Biking is a direct route to lowering carbon emissions. In fact, if more people biked instead of drove to work, it would save $25 trillion globally by 2050 and cut carbon emissions by 10%, a 2015 study from the University of California-Davis and the Institute for Transportation and Development Policy in New York found. Currently about 6% of miles traveled in world cities is by bike, most of which comes from bike-friendly countries including Japan, China, the Netherlands and Denmark. In the U.S., only 1% of urban trips are made by bike. Experts say this number could be a lot higher: 35% of trips American commuters make are less than 5 kilometers (3 miles), or easily covered in a 20-minute bike ride. Around 35% of trips American commuters make are less than 5 kilometers (3 miles), or easily covered in a 20-minute bike ride. However, not all cities in the U.S. are bike-friendly, and biking advocates say that won’t change unless more citizens get involved. Nonprofit People for Bikes suggests attending community input meetings and building partnerships with businesses to lobby for bike lanes and other safety measures in their communities. As of 2014, there were bike lanes in 24 states and 53 cities and cities like Los Angeles have created recent policy shifts toward cutting car lanes and adding bike and bus lanes instead. —Kari Paul World Leaders Condemn Trump Climate Decision 9. Embrace dietary changes and skip avocado toast Bad news: Saving the environment may mean skipping that avocado toast. Skyrocketing demand (and prices) for avocados has driven farmers toward illegally cutting down trees in rain forests across Mexico, according to The Guardian newspaper in the U.K. In total, roughly 1,700 acres of forests were lost as a result of increased avocado production in the Mexican state of Michoacan alone, researchers predict. From cutting avocados out to avoiding products with palm oil (another product that has caused deforestation around the globe), choosing to eat a sustainable diet is another way to protect against climate change. Meat products are far and away the worst food products when it comes to the greenhouse gases stemming from their production, transportation and consumption, data from the Environmental Working Group found. Lamb is the worst culprit, causing 39.2 kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions for every kilogram eaten. Comparatively, lentils produce less than 1 kilogram of carbon dioxide for every kilogram eaten. See Meat Eater’s Guide to Climate Change + Health for more. —Jacob Passy 10. Stay green at the office and unplug your computer We know office design can improve concentration, but did you know it can also help the environment? Interior decorators are increasingly incorporating living walls into corporate office spaces to naturally cool offices during summer months and improve air quality. Even if you don’t have a hand in office planning, there are many measures you can take at your own desk to help the environment. Use power strips rather than individual plugs and invest in power-saving electronic devices for your desk. Also, don’t forget the basics: Turn off the lights, unplug electronics, and shut down your computer when you leave for the day. —Kari Paul 11. Avoid the SUV and, if you must, take nonstop flights Where travelers go and how they get there can be a significant source of pollution. And when it comes to vacationing, air travel is one of the worst culprits. Aircraft produce up to 2.5% of total global carbon dioxide emissions, according to data from the Centre for Aviation, Transport and the Environment at Manchester Metropolitan University http://www.cate.mmu.ac.uk/projects/bridging-the-aviation-co2-emissions-gap-why-emissions-trading-is-needed/ . That rate would make the aviation industry one of the world’s 10 largest carbon dioxide emitters, if it were a country, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. Taking a solo road trip in an SUV produces roughly 60% more greenhouse gases than your portion of a plane’s greenhouse gas emissions on a flight the same distance. While flying is bad for the environment, driving can be even worse. Taking a solo road trip in an SUV produces roughly 60% more greenhouse gases than your portion of a plane’s greenhouse gas emissions on a flight the same distance, per data from the Sightline Institute, a policy research non-profit based in Seattle. The best ways to travel include taking motor coaches or trains. If flying is a necessity, there are ways to make a smaller impact on the environment. Because first-class seats take up roughly twice the amount of space, someone flying in coach accommodations is responsible for about half the carbon emissions, a report from the Union of Concerned Scientists concluded. Similarly, choosing a non-stop flight is better for the environment (even if it’s worse for your wallet) because takeoff, landing and taxiing to and from the terminal uses so much energy. The Union of Concerned Scientists estimated that a 1,000-mile nonstop flight from New York City to Orlando saves nearly 35% the carbon emissions versus a two-connection flight itinerary. —Jacob Passy More from Dow Jones Media Six ways ‘Working Girl’ taught us to work it A former banker’s disillusionment with British politics Signet Jewelers Is Up to Its Neck With Bad News SMARTASSET.COM","June 7, 2017 9:04 a.m. ET",12,11 ways to build a Paris climate change accord — in your own community,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-build-your-own-paris-agreement-on-climate-change-in-your-own-home-2017-06-02
ACM,"We have such a short attention span as investors. Not only did Wall Street fully price in the effect of a Donald Trump presidency in two months across November and December last year, but apparently some investors are already giving up on the “Trump trade” before the president’s first 100 days are up. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%   has dropped 3.1% through Thursday since closing at a record on March 1, although it is still up 11.6% since Election Day. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%   has dropped 2.8% from its record close on March 1, trimming post-election gains to 8.85%. Perhaps more tellingly of what the fast money is doing, financial stocks have skidded more than 8% since March 1. You can blame old saws like “buy the rumor, sell the news.” Or you can blame newfangled distractions like a cellphone video showing a passenger being dragged off a flight and the nonstop news cycle of outrage that follows. Read: The stock market will be stuck in ‘purgatory’ until this happens But let’s not be too hasty. Like it or not, Donald Trump has four years in the White House and Republicans are still in control of both houses of Congress. We are a long way from the end of the Trump era. And while there have admittedly been setbacks and surprises, investors still should be looking to Washington for cues in 2017. Here’s what I expect to happen in the coming months based on the initial actions under President Trump and how Wall Street will embrace a new version of the “Trump trade”: Defense stocks should rise amid Mideast unrest I’ve been appalled for years at the staggering scale of the humanitarian crisis in Syria. But moralizing never seems to get me anywhere, particularly in the age of Trump, so let’s skip right to the trade: defense stocks. Picks like Raytheon Co. RTN, +2.26%   that manufacturer the Tomahawk missiles launched last week are top-of-mind, but don’t forget that the broader Trump budget proposal was heavy on defense — including specific calls to boost the F-35 stealth fighter program run by Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +0.78%   and production of other jet fighters and sub-hunting aircraft manufactured mainly by Boeing Co. BA, +2.46%  . In light of recent airstrikes and the support Trump has won among hawkish Republicans as a result, it seems highly unlikely that spending like this will be on the chopping block. Keep in mind, too, that the start of a conflict can be a big boost to these picks regardless of whether the conflict is deemed proper or popular in the long-term. After the Iraq “shock and awe” campaign at the end of March 2003, Raytheon surged 24% in two months and Boeing leapt about 20%. Here's how drones will change the future of warfare Tech companies can juice their buybacks with repatriation tax breaks It’s old news how much cash tech stocks have lying around overseas, but I’ll revisit the math for you. In its 2016 annual report, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.10%     reported $113.2 billion in cash, but 83% of that was held by foreign subsidiaries — meaning roughly $94 billion in overseas capital. If that was hit by current taxes by a maximum of 35%, that shrinks to “only” $61 billion. But if Trump gets his way with a tax repatriation holiday rate of around 10%, Microsoft will have access to almost $85 billion. I’m not naive enough to presume that extra $24 billion in tax savings will go to jobs or factories, but you can be sure it will juice buybacks and prompt a special dividend that lifts Microsoft stock. The same is true for other firms such as Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78% Cisco Systems Inc. CSCO, +2.95%  and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.60%  . Construction firms will benefit from bipartisan infrastructure bill On balance, I’m pretty skeptical of Trump’s ability to get anything done with a divided GOP in Congress and an even more divided electorate. However, I don’t buy the notion that infrastructure spending is impossible just because it could be expensive. Polling of voters has shown strong support of infrastructure spending, and it’s one of the few areas where Democrats and moderate Republicans will agree. A recent “Infrastructure Report Card” from the American Society of Civil Engineers that gave our roads, bridges and waterways a collective grade of D+ underscores how the need is so great. Particularly after the Obamacare repeal-and-replace defeat and what I expect will be a disappointing push at comprehensive tax reform, infrastructure will be the path of least resistance for Trump to notch a policy win. That means firms like gravel giant Vulcan Materials Co. VMC, +2.58% machinery giant Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +1.53%  and transportation engineer AECOM ACM, +2.59%  should be decent bets. How 4D mapping could change the way we live and work Don’t forget energy infrastructure efforts While roads and wastewater systems spring to mind most often when we talk of infrastructure, let’s not forget the energy infrastructure that has become increasingly important in the age of fracking and tar sands in North America. The much-maligned Keystone XL pipeline proposed by TransCanada Corp. TRP, +2.63%  has gotten the most press, but there are other projects such as the Dakota Access Pipeline — under construction by Energy Transfer Partners LP ETP, +0.81%   — that have been helped by the administration. And with the focus on energy jobs and independence from foreign oil, you can be sure pipeline and storage companies including Magellan Midstream Partners LP MMP, +2.08%  or Enterprise Products Partners LP EPD, +1.75%  will benefit from less red tape and delays on future projects. U.S.-only companies look safer than the alternatives There’s admittedly plenty of wrangling around the defense budget, infrastructure and the other issues listed above. But whether it’s a tax break or stimulus to help American consumers, or a trade war or literal military conflict that affects multinationals, one thing is clear: Trump’s nationalist worldview will always favor U.S. businesses. That ultimately may wind up being a net negative in the long run, but it’s the way things are. Furthermore, with Brexit to China’s slowing growth to conflict in Syria to missile launches in North Korea … well, there are plenty of reasons to be wary about investing abroad. Thus, consumer plays like Southwest Airlines Co. LUV, +1.83% or Macy’s Inc. M, +2.30% both of which generate almost every penny of revenue within the U.S., may be noteworthy. The same is true for business-facing companies like Paychex Inc. PAYX, +1.63%  or CBIZ Inc. CBZ, +0.00%  that almost exclusively serve American clients.

ACM,"And there goes the Dow to 20,000. Boom! Some background on this journey and the “amazing persistence” of the more-than-100-year old index comes from the The Price Action Lab Blog . In the last 28 trading days, the DJIA has come within 0.5% of that 20,000 level 21 times. Read: What Dow 20,000 means for stock market investors Now that the Dow has climbed over 20,000, investors will be looking out to see what’s in its path today for another move higher. Watch for U.S. oil inventory data later — if it shows an uptick as expected, that could get investors cheering over the potential for cheaper prices, says ADS’s Remo Fritschi. The Price Action Lab Blog The dogged Dow An actionable day indeed looms, with POTUS ready to update us on his Mexican wall plans. Watch the peso MXNUSD, -0.202218%  , which may not take that too well, though it’s potentially another boost for the dollar. The dollar index DXY, -0.08%   is down about 2% so far this month, and it’s the subject of our call of the day. Bret Jensen of the Investors Alley blog reminds us just how much the greenback means to investors. Warnings that the dollar is too strong from President Donald Trump and his Treasury Secretary pick Steven Mnuchin have weighed on the buck recently. But Jensen says investors need to get ready for the battle to come between the new administration and Federal Reserve chief Janet Yellen, who boosted the greenback earlier this month with word of “a few rate hikes” possibly coming this year. Jensen talks about the many ways this faceoff could play out, noting that it will likely end with dollar-weakening protectionist trade policies — the water-cooler talk du jour. As for stocks, he says look out for the hit on drugs, consumer staples and technology. Want to avoid the coming battle altogether? Jensen says line your portfolio with infrastructure stocks such as Vulcan Materials VMC, +2.58%  , Aecom ACM, +2.59%   and Itron ITRI, +2.65%  . “Then you could just sit back with a bowl of popcorn and watch the fireworks surrounding the dollar,” he says.

ACM,"I can safely say that, from my 35 years in the financial markets, to be consistently successful at investing, one must put prudence over popularity. Human nature as it is, investors often find it difficult to take unpopular actions. My motivation in writing this column is to nudge you to take five unpopular, but prudent, actions today. But before I do that, let’s look at two charts and understand the concept of “over-owned.” Two charts The charts compare five currently over-owned stocks in five sectors of the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38% The first is a daily chart of the period since Donald Trump's election. The second is a monthly chart since the start of the current bull market. Please click here for the annotated chart comparing five popular stocks in five popular sectors since Donald Trump's election. Please click here for the annotated chart comparing five popular stocks in five popular sectors since the start of the current bull market. The popular stocks that will help you understand the actions described below are Martin Marietta MLM, +2.73% Pfizer PFE, +0.54% General Mills GIS, +1.60% Duke Energy Corp. DUK, +0.06% and Nvidia NVDA, +4.63% These stocks are compared with the S&P 500 ETF SPY, +1.28% in the charts. If you are uninitiated in inter-market analysis, these charts may at first seem intimidating. I suggest you look at them for a few minutes, and you will see several insights jumping out at you. Over-owned Some readers may say that the five stocks listed above have good fundamentals and technicals. The unpopular, but prudent, action, however, is to take some profits now that the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  is close to an expensive 20,000 points. ""If both fundamentals and technicals are good, why take partial profits?"" might be the question. The answer lies in an important concept that some investors and analysts tend to ignore at their own peril. The concept can be best described by one word: ""over-owned."" In the simplest terms, stocks go up when there are more buyers than sellers. What happens when almost everyone who is going to buy a stock has already bought it? The answer: There is no fuel to propel the stock upward. As an example, The Arora Report gave a “sell” signal right at the peak before Apple AAPL, +0.78%  fell by over $300 pre-split. One key component of our algorithms that made the call was over-ownership. (This call can be easily verified if you have been a subscriber to The Arora Report or by reading MarketWatch.) Sell popular infrastructure stocks Infrastructure stocks are flying high. On the surface it makes a lot of sense. Trump plans to build a wall on the Mexican border and has been emphasizing improving infrastructure throughout the U.S. It’s important to note that infrastructure stocks were also Hillary Clinton stocks. A favorite Wall Street thesis was to buy infrastructure stocks as it was deemed a winning proposition irrespective of who won the election. As a result, the stocks were overbought going into the election, and now that the election is over, are becoming even more overbought. Furthermore, these stocks are expensive both relative to their own histories and their projected earnings growth rates. Examples of infrastructure stocks are Martin Marietta, Vulcan Materials VMC, +2.58% Granite Construction GVA, +4.67% Tetra Tech TTEK, +1.24% Fluor FLR, +2.45% KBR KBR, +3.58% United Rentals URI, +2.14% Aecom ACM, +2.59% Terex TEX, +2.13% and Manitowoc MTW, +3.87% These stocks should be avoided, but considered for purchase only in the event of a pullback. Sell popular pharmaceutical stocks Americans pay a lot more for drugs than people in other countries. That’s why you ought to sell large U.S.-based companies. After all, they are at risk of Trump tweets. Examples include, Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% Merck MRK, -1.13% Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY, +1.09% Abbott ABT, +1.16% and Eli Lilly LLY, +0.47% Sell popular utility stocks Utilities will benefit from deregulation, but higher interest rates will outweigh that. These popular stocks have become very over-owned and expensive. Examples include Duke Energy, Southern Co. SO, +0.04% NextEra NEE, +0.65% American Electric Power AEP, -0.10% PG&E PCG, +1.60% and Edison International EIX, +0.94% Trim dividend-paying stocks Dividend-paying stocks have been very popular and overowned. As a result they have become very expensive. They will be negatively impacted by rising interest rates. Examples include General Mills, Kellogg K, +1.74% Philip Morris PM, -0.39% Kimberly-Clark KMB, +0.61% Sysco SYY, +0.99% and Tupperware TUP, +2.33% Trim popular technology stocks Investors are oblivious that some popular technology stocks get a large portion of their sales from China. If there is a trade war with China, these stocks will get hurt. A rising dollar also is punitive. Examples include Nvidia, Broadcom AVGO, -0.44% Intel INTC, +5.00% Cisco CSCO, +2.95% IBM IBM, +0.60% and Oracle ORCL, +1.71% What to do now Some of the cash raised from sales described above should be deployed in less risky stocks and ETFs that are likely to do well.

The construction company expects adjusted profit in 2017 in a range of $2.70 to $3.10 a share, compared with the consensus estimate from analysts of $3.24 a share, according to FactSet.

ACM,"AFP/Getty Images Trump pulled off a stunning victory. The Wall Street fashion this morning is to buy Trump stocks, sell bonds, sell gold GLD, +0.05%  and silver SLV, +0.33% and sell Clinton stocks. The probability is very high that you will lose money following Wall Street in buying Trump stocks and selling Clinton stocks. Before discussing specifics, let us understand the background. Background Let us start by carefully examining the chart of Nasdaq 100 futures US:NQZ6 The equivalent ETF is QQQ, +1.83% I would have preferred to use a QQQ chart or S&P 500 chart SPY, +1.28%  because most investors do not trade futures, but ETFs do not trade all hours like futures. Please click here for the annotated futures chart. Stock futures initially fell limit down 5% before recovering and even turning positive, as shown on the annotated chart of Nasdaq futures. This up move is shocking Wall Street again as they were predicting further down move. Wall Street was wrong, and that by itself gives you a reason not to follow them. Let’s dig down and take a look at what the Trump victory may mean for stocks. Infrastructure stocks Infrastructure stocks are flying sky high. On the surface, it makes a lot of sense. Trump plans to build a wall on the Mexican border and has been emphasizing improving infrastructure. It is important to note that infrastructure stocks were also Clinton stocks. One of the favorite Wall Street theses was to buy infrastructure stocks as it was deemed a winning proposition irrespective of who won the election. As a result, these stocks were overbought going into the election and after the election, are becoming even more overbought. Furthermore, these stocks are expensive both relative to their own histories and also relative to their projected earnings growth rates even under Trump presidency. Examples of the favorite Trump infrastructure stocks are Martin Marietta MLM, +2.73% Vulcan Materials VMC, +2.58% Granite Construction GVA, +4.67% Tetra Tech TTEK, +1.24% FLR, +2.45%  KBR KBR, +3.58%  , United Rentals URI, +2.14% AECOM ACM, +2.59% Terex TEX, +2.13% and Manitowoc MTW, +3.87% These stocks should be avoided at this time and considered for buying only if there is a significant pull back. Gold and silver Wall Street was predicting gold to jump up $100-$200. Gold jumped up to $1336, nowhere near $100 gain, and then plunged to $1280. If you had bought gold on the Trump victory, you would be losing money right now. ETFs of interest are GLD and SLV. A small position in gold and silver is fine, but taking on a huge position on Trump victory is not supported by hard data at this time. Bonds Wall Street is selling bonds on the assumption that Trump will be a big spender. Selling bonds based on the Trump victory ignores offsetting factors. The first is that the Federal Reserve is less likely to orchestrate a series of rate hikes after Trump victory. The second is that both Senate and House are now controlled by Republicans, including many deficit hawks. Trump himself is cognizant of the high national debt. ETFs of interest are iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF TLT, +0.49% and ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury TBT, -1.14% Steel stocks Steel stocks are rocketing based on Trump’s commitment to revive the steel industry in the United States and potential to restrict Chinese steel. Take a look at United States Steel X, +4.92% AK Steel AKS, +5.84% Nucor NUE, +2.98% and Steel Dynamics STLD, +3.56% However, there are already tariffs on Chinese steel. Hospital stocks Hospital stocks are being crushed on Trump’s commitment to repeal ObamaCare. Take a look at Tenet Healthcare THC, +1.76% Community Health Systems CYH, -3.65% and HCA HCA, -0.15%  However, Trump has repeatedly stated that he will replace ObamaCare with something great. Any replacement of ObamaCare will be beneficial for hospital stocks. For this reason, it is not the best idea to sell these hospital stocks at these low prices. Medicaid stocks Medicaid insurance stocks are being crushed on potential repeal of ObamaCare. Take a look at Molina Healthcare MOH, +2.64%  and Centene Corp CNC, +6.50% However, Trump has repeatedly stated that he is a compassionate man and those who cannot afford will be provided health care under his plan. In the end, Medicaid insurance stocks are likely to be the beneficiaries. Coal stocks Coal stocks are ripping on Trump’s commitment to revive the coal industry. Take a look at Foresight Energy FELP, +0.57% Cloud Peak Energy CLD, -9.35%  and Peabody Energy US:BTUUQ However, coal competes with natural gas and natural gas is simply too cheap. Take a look at natural gas ETFs UNG, +1.12%  and UGAZ, +3.49% What to do now At The Arora Report, we did not jump on the Clinton rally and came into today holding good long-term positions both on the long and short sides, 27%-38% cash, medium-term hedges of 25% and short-term hedges of 5%. Our tentative plan was to buy on a Trump victory if the market dipped. We would have implemented that plan this morning if the market had stayed down. Now the market has come back strong, it makes no sense to buy high right here. Right now, temporarily, cash is king. Our focus will be on buying special situations unless the market dips.

ACM,"So you’re betting that Hillary Clinton will be sworn in as our 45th president in January. All investors should be pleased if this is the outcome. As I wrote a month ago, Donald Trump’s economic proposals would be detrimental to the stock market and downright dangerous for the U.S. economy. I was hardly alone in this sentiment, with a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund warning of the risks of a Trump presidency recently, and the stock market suffering a nine-day stretch of declines — the longest such run since 1980 — on mere glimmers of hope for Trump. But forget Trump. While his plans were clearly bad for the economy, while he is a pathological liar, documented misogynist and not-so-closeted racist, going forward he should be now (mercifully) irrelevant to the markets SPX, +1.38%   and the course of the U.S. economy. Follow the MarketWatch live blog of election coverage as results roll in. Why Does the Stock Market Want Hillary? So let’s talk about what will matter — namely, what the global economy will look like under President Clinton and which stocks will succeed. Here’s what I think would make the perfect Hillary portfolio for 2017. Aecom The nation’s crumbling infrastructure is a sore point in many communities, and a big part of the Clinton campaign was a plan to invest $275 billion over five years in roads, rails and other projects. While multinational names like Caterpillar Inc. CAT, +1.53%   are frequently bandied about to play this trend, I prefer the midcap industrial Aecom ACM, +2.59% which generated over a third of its fiscal-year 2015 revenue from state, local and federal contracts here in the U.S. and 69% of total revenue from within America. This company is as direct a play as you’ll find on U.S. infrastructure spending, and after a $6 billion acquisition of rival URS in 2014, Aecom has plenty of scale and capacity to step up and profit from this trend. Read: Watch these dozen critical counties on Election Night 8Point3 Energy Partners Under President Barack Obama, energy regulations were very much against dirty sources like coal and in favor of cleaner sources like solar and natural gas.

But she’ll continue that fight with a knowledge that the American people don’t have the stomach for many boots on the ground. That means increased reliance on drones and air assaults, which will benefit Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, +0.78% This is one of the government’s favorite contractors, generating nearly $36 billion of its $46 billion-plus in total revenue from the U.S. government in FY2015. While military spending is always in the crosshairs, the cuts from recent years are unlikely to accelerate further — and even with a smaller pie, Lockheed is clearly getting a very big slice. Yes, there are risks for the stock, but a 3% dividend yield after a double-digit increase in payouts this fall helps you hedge your bets. Two Things to Watch on Election Night Tyson Foods In an age of heightened tensions around immigration, executives at Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, +0.36%  may have been mighty nervous lately. That’s because the poultry giant relies heavily on foreign-born workers and in fact was accused of actively recruiting illegal immigrants from Latin America more than a decade ago. Things have changed a lot in the intervening years, both for Tyson and for the political climate in America, and a more welcoming environment for immigrants will be a win-win both for workers who come to the U.S. for opportunity and employers like Tyson who rely heavily on unskilled foreign-born workers to keep things running. In short, Clinton’s pro-immigration policies will help Tyson keep labor costs down. Considering Tyson stock already has a bargain forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 14 compared with an average of almost 18 for S&P 500 stocks, that bodes very well for Tyson Foods. Read: How employers could stop illegal immigration in seconds Intermediate-Term Corporate Bond ETF Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve hinted that he would push hard for an interest-rate hike, but Clinton has been much more circumspect about the central bank and reluctant to hasten a premature rate increase. So while we may see another interest-rate increase in December, chances are the Fed will remain relatively dovish on rates for the next year or so. Read: Fed’s Evans says not confident U.S. central bank will hit its 2% target That means the SPDR Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate Term Corporate Bond ETF US:ITR  is a good balance between long-term interest-rate risk and the anemic yields of short-term debt. With an average maturity of five years, ITR won’t be as exposed to the tail end of the yield curve, and investment-grade bonds instead of Treasurys give the fund a current yield of about 2.6% — significantly higher than the 1.8% yielded by 10-year T-notes. As the European Central Bank and Bank of Japan both pursue negative rates, it’s hard to imagine the Fed will diverge significantly from this trend, or that the rate picture will change under Hillary Clinton’s administration. What can artificial intelligence do for retail? Unilever Speaking of Europe and Japan, it’s worth taking a step back and getting a global economic perspective even as we talk about U.S. politics. Because as much as I thought Trump was cancerous for stocks and the global economy, I also think nobody can really drive significant growth with a hyperpartisan House of Representatives and a stagnant global outlook. That’s why I think it’s important to hedge your bets with London-based consumer staples giant Unilever PLC ADR UL, +0.83% ULVR, +1.02% UNA, +1.17% Unilever has mammoth brands including Lipton teas and Dove soaps that will prove recession-proof (if it comes to the “R” word). It’s a true multinational with operations in 190 countries and sales at home in Europe as well as in the U.S. and (increasingly) in emerging markets. As much as I would love to say that brighter days are ahead of us, investors need to be realistic and objective about stock-market valuations and macro risks in the next few years. Thus, it’s prudent to balance the tactical plays above with a globalized staples bet — because in 2017, you can’t build a wall around the U.S. economy, and you shouldn’t do so with your personal portfolio, either.

ACM,"Hillary Clinton triggered an uproar earlier this month when she grouped some of rival Donald Trump’s supporters into a “basket of deplorables.” But Deutsche Bank this week had a different type of basket in mind when it released its Clinton versus Trump trading strategies. “Our S&P targets and sector strategy assume a balanced outcome from the U.S. general election on Nov 8 that maintains the current split in power,” said David Bianco, an investment strategist at Deutsche Bank. Outgoing President Barack Obama is a Democrat; the House and Senate are controlled by Republicans. Bianco earlier this year had forecast the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  to close out 2016 at 2,150. A political landscape in which different parties divide up the presidency and the control of the Senate is likely to lead to more market volatility, according to the strategist. That the presidential candidates are unable to communicate their economic policies to the voting public is also contributing to the lack of clarity. “It’s difficult to pin down specific policies from either candidate but on several economic issues their general bias is clear” he said. Still, the investment strategist suggested several possible plays in case either party unexpectedly wins both the White House and Capitol Hill in November. As Bianco sees it, a Republican sweep led by Trump would be good for some oil producers by opening the way to more drilling. But it could also hurt some energy stocks as additional supply would weigh on prices. It could also result in faster interest rate increases and a stronger dollar. “If Fed hikes bring yield-curve flattening, then big banks and capital markets likely outperform small banks and insurance companies,” he said. Republican control of the executive and legislative branches would also translate into more pressure on corporations to repatriate their foreign earnings. U.S. multinationals like Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78% General Electric Co. GE, -1.46% Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.10% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.60%  are estimated to be keeping billions of dollars offshore to avoid taxes at home. A Democratic sweep, meanwhile, would likely to result in a push for a higher inflation target by the Fed, while trade, commodities, life insurers, and health care services sectors are expected to benefit. “Slow hikes that allow inflation to accelerate and steepen the curve might favor smaller banks and insurance, but this could pressure price-earnings [ratios] at non-financials,” he said. For investors looking for more specific plays, Deutsche Bank recommends the following baskets: Clinton UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH, -2.06% Humana Inc. HUM, +0.48% McKesson Corp. MCK, +0.15% AECOM ACM, +2.59% Quanta Services Inc. PWR, +1.42% Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +2.47% Alcoa Inc. AA, +1.22% NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, +0.65% Cree Inc. CREE, +1.87% First Solar Inc.

CMCSA, +2.67% Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW, +2.59% Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, +1.81% and Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL, +1.63% But as the strategist notes, given the likelihood of a power-split between the two major parties, the outcome of the election is not likely to have an significant impact on the market in the near term. “Longer-term, it will be the policies and implementation that will influence markets, which both parties, many individuals and circumstances will craft,” Bianco said. Clinton is slightly ahead of Trump nationwide, according to the latest average of polls from RealClearPolitics. But averages also show her neck and neck with Trump in key battleground states including Florida.

ACM,"SINGAPORE—This wealthy financial center is known world-wide for its tidy streets and tight controls on personal behavior, including famous restrictions on the sale of chewing gum to keep the city clean. Now Singapore may soon be known for something else: the most extensive effort to collect data on daily living ever attempted in a city. As part of its Smart Nation program, launched by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in late 2014, Singapore is deploying an undetermined number of sensors and cameras across the island city-state that will allow the government to monitor everything from the cleanliness of public spaces to the density of crowds and the precise movement of every locally registered vehicle. It is a sweeping effort that will likely touch the lives of every single resident in the country, in ways that aren’t completely clear since many potential applications may not be known until the system is fully implemented. Already, for instance, authorities are developing or using systems that can tell when people are smoking in prohibited zones or littering from high-rise housing. But the data collected in this next phase — and how it’s used — will go far beyond that. Much of the data will be fed into an online platform, dubbed Virtual Singapore, that will give the government an unprecedented look into how the country is functioning in real time, allowing them to predict, for example, how infectious diseases might spread or how crowds could react to an explosion in a shopping mall. The government also plans to share data, in some cases, with the private sector. Just looking Officials say the program is designed to improve government services through technology, better connect its citizens, and encourage private-sector innovations. For instance, sensors deployed by private companies in some elderly people’s publicly managed homes will alert family if they stop moving, and even record when they use the toilet in an attempt to monitor general health. Yet the government also says it isn’t certain what kinds of applications might be possible once the system is built, and hasn’t decided where all the sensors will be located, raising privacy concerns. A spokesman says that the government will only deploy sensors when there are specific benefits to citizens, and that it doesn’t set out to build systems and collect data before deciding what to do with it. Any decision to use data collected by Smart Nation sensors for law enforcement or surveillance would not, under Singapore law, need court approval or citizen consultation. If the network is somehow hacked, criminals could potentially access a trove of data about citizens’ lives. “The big, big elephant in the room is protection of privacy and ensuring security,” says Vivian Balakrishnan, Singapore’s foreign affairs minister and minister-in-charge of Smart Nation. “We don’t have the answers,” though the government is studying the issue and is dedicated to ensuring citizens maintain privacy, he says. The government hasn’t held a public discussion on the issue, but has said that data will be anonymized to the greatest extent possible, and that it already has measures in place to protect data it collects. The project appears to be popular in Singapore, where faith in the government is high and citizens have accepted limits on behavior, including restrictions on public speech and the press, in return for a more efficient state. “I trust the system here,” says Jerelyn Hew, 30, who works for a locally based online-learning company, when asked her opinion about Smart Nation during lunch. Hew says she looks forward to benefits such as easier parking. Other cities, such as New York and Barcelona, have used sensors and computer networks to analyze such things as residents’ sleeping patterns and availability of parking spots. But those projects are typically narrow in scope and often siloed in individual agencies or research bodies. Singapore’s program is highly centralized. The various projects are coordinated by a Smart Nation bureau in Prime Minister Lee’s office, which works with relevant government bodies on ideas. About a dozen trial projects have been launched so far, with many targeted for wider implementation. The total cost is undisclosed. AFP/Getty Images Authorities are developing or using systems that can tell when people are smoking in prohibited zones or littering from high-rise housing “Singapore is doing it at a level of integration and scale that no one else has done yet,” says Guy Perry, an executive of the Los Angeles engineering design firm Aecom ACM, +2.59% who studies “smart city” technologies. It helps in Singapore that government- or state-owned companies own or control many aspects of daily life, including public transport networks and housing. More than 80% of Singapore’s 5.5 million people live in government housing. And while Singapore is a democracy, it has always been dominated by a single party whose control of the system means it can move quickly. Leaders also see a chance to pioneer applications for export. The market for smart-city technology in Asia alone will reach US$1 trillion a year by 2025, according to IDC Government Insights, a unit of International Data Corp., the Framingham, Mass., research firm. Crystal ball The centerpiece of Singapore’s effort is a kind of digital crystal ball that acts as a superpowered, X-ray version of Google Maps. Sensor data will be fed into this system, which will store exact dimensions of buildings, placement of windows and types of construction materials used. The system is being built by the government’s National Research Foundation, in coordination with private-sector firms, universities and other government departments. The government has already published a 2-D online map of Singapore that allows the public to see current closed-circuit TV footage, check flooding levels and monitor open spaces in parking lots. Officials say the data-packed map will help them better decide where to reroute buses based on where riders are gathering. It could also be used to model how new skyscrapers might affect wind-flow patterns or telecommunications signals, or map the potential spread of infectious diseases into buildings. When such huge volumes of data are collected and cross-referenced, experts say, applications emerge that are difficult to imagine until the material is available in the first place. “It is a little bit of a build-and-they-will-come approach,” says Tim Greisinger, managing director of International Business Machines Corp. IBM, +0.60% in Singapore, whose firm is developing some technology used in Smart Nation. “What could you do once you have it?” he wonders, referring to the national network of sensors. “The opportunities are endless.” Other new Smart Nation technologies that have been tested include the cameras that detect when people are smoking in prohibited zones — useful for a city that is serious about policing such behavior. As part of routine enforcement last year, unrelated to Smart Nation, the government said it fined a 38-year-old man roughly $14,000 after he was caught repeatedly throwing cigarette butts out of his high-rise apartment. He was photographed shirtless by security cameras, and images of his transgression were posted on the website of Singapore’s environmental agency. Singapore has also tested systems using citizens’ smartphones to measure the bumpiness of bus rides, which could indicate road maintenance requirements. Other initiatives include mandatory satellite-linked devices that will be placed in all Singapore-registered vehicles — including those of private citizens — to charge tolls more precisely, based on precise distances driven. It also would permit dynamic pricing throughout the day, depending on road conditions. Sensors for the elderly Then there is the elderly resident monitoring program, which started on a trial basis in 2014 and is voluntary. The sensors measure movements in the home. The data is handled by private companies selected by the government. It can be accessed, with family members’ permission, by caregivers. Although free for trial participants, the thinking is that residents would pay for the service in the future. Doris Oo says she has used the system when leaving her 79-year-old mother at home alone in the apartment they share. She got text messages when her mother’s movements changed, suggesting potential illness or distress. “It was really peace of mind,” Oo says. She says that she is eager to participate in an expanded effort set to launch soon — and that neither she nor her mother feel the technology is invasive.

For the current year, Aecom said it expects per-share earnings between $2.40 to $2.50, below the $2.57 expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Chief Executive John M. Dionisio noted that the view ""reflects continued pressure on growth as a result of the global macro-economic climate."" For the fourth quarter, Aecom recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $2.88 a share, or $317 million net of tax, related to its Europe business and its management support services unit, which provides services primarily for U.S. government agencies. Aecom said in Europe, the impairment charge resulted mainly from the negative impact of economic trends, which drove a reduction in profit levels.

Gyrodyne GYRO, -0.82%  hired financial and legal parties for advice on how to go about maximizing shareholder value, the St. James, N.Y.-based a real estate investment trust said. Among the options to be explored are a potential sale, merger or other strategic combination as well as one or more potential cash distributions, according to Gyrodyne, which noted that there can be no assurance that any option will be ultimately adopted. The company also announced that Stephen Maroney resigned Aug. 16 as chief executive and president and that Chief Financial Officer Gary Fitlin has been named to fill the posts on an interim basis.

UNT, +21.08% to acquire properties in North Dakota promising “significant crude-oil development.” Denver-based QEP paid about $1.38 billion cash in the transactions, which will give the company net daily production of about 10,500 barrels of oil equivalent as well as development opportunities near its existing core acreage in the Williston Basin. They’re expected to close on or before Sept. 27, the company said. QEP pegged net proved and probable reserves at about 125 million barrels of oil equivalent — 81% crude, 10% natural gas and 9% natural gas liquids. To reflect the additional properties, QEP raised its 2012 forecasts for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization as well as for production and capital investment. For their part, Black Hill said it would use net proceeds of about $230 million to $240 million to pay down debt and help fund growth projects such as the Cheyenne Prairie Generating Station, while Unit said its deal with QEP is in keeping with plans to divest non-core assets.

ACM,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- President Barack Obama's proposed infrastructure plan is designed to put people back to work -- and it may offer an opportunity for you to put your portfolio back to work, too. In several important ways, the infrastructure plan resembles an ""investment policy statement,"" which many investors adopt to help them organize and reach their financial goals. For example: -- The time horizon for the infrastructure plan is long-term. -- The expected beneficiaries from the plan are spread throughout many segments of the economy. -- And because not all the $825 billion will be spent at once, a portfolio designed to take advantage of the plan may benefit from a dollar-cost averaging approach, in which funds are allocated to the market over a period of time. But where to allocate them? The team of analysts at my firm forecasts that the following areas of the economy stand to benefit from the government spending: Basic materials: The plan may prove to be the single, largest new investment in the nation's infrastructure -- roads, dams and bridges -- since the Interstate Highway system was built in the 1950s. Initial estimates call for $92 billion in spending on construction projects. At the base of these structures will be steel and construction aggregates, among other commodities, produced by companies such as Vulcan Materials VMC, +2.58% MDU Resources MDU, +0.97% and Alcoa Corp. AA, +1.22% Transportation: Commodities must be moved from mines and mills to work sites. In the U.S., rail companies in position to benefit include Burlington Northern Santa Fe BNI and Norfolk Southern Corp. NSC, +1.35% Globally, China has also launched its own $600 billion infrastructure spending plan. Shipping companies bringing coal and grain into China include Genco Shipping & Trading Ltd. GNK, +2.75% Energy: To get the money moving fast, the administration is considering investments into ""shovel ready"" projects that are beyond the planning stages and under construction. Utilities with large infrastructure build-out programs, such as new transmission lines and grid enhancements, include Northeast Utilities NU, -7.41% ITC Holdings ITC, +2.92% and UIL Holdings UIL, +5.71% In addition, the $58 billion the plan sets aside for investments into energy projects, and is expected to drive newer ""green"" alternatives. Investors may want to consider prominent utilities with large amounts of wind power in commercial operation such as FPL Group FPL, +1.97% Westar Energy WR, +1.25% and Alliant Energy LNT, +0.59% Industrial equipment -- large cap: By the fall, local municipalities should be spending federal taxpayer funds on roads, bridges, dams, etc. You will know when you see an increase of yellow earthmovers. Indeed, the machinery segment of Caterpillar CAT, +1.53% accounts for two-thirds of the company's sales and has a leading market position. Siemens AG SI also is a core industrial infrastructure play, with businesses including locomotive manufacturing and turbine operations. Industrial equipment -- small-cap: Not every industrial company expected to benefit is as iconic as Caterpillar. EnerNOC Holdings Inc. ENOC an electrical demand management company, may be tapped to help companies improve energy efficiency throughout their footprint. Equinix EQIX, +0.27% is a market leader in neutral peering, which could prove valuable with Obama's goals of ramping up broadband access. Construction management: AECOM Technology ACM, +2.59% is a global provider of planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design, and construction management services for a broad range of infrastructure projects. In its most recent quarter, revenue rose 33% and infrastructure and environmental programs accounted for almost 60% of sales. When you ride the 2nd Avenue subway in New York, you're benefiting from AECOM's expertise. Business services: RSC Holdings RRR, +1.17% is one of the largest equipment rental providers in North America, with a broad range of equipment for the nonresidential construction and industrial markets. ITT Educational Services Inc. ESI, +5.59% is a leading for-profit provider of post-secondary educational degree programs, including electronics, information technology, drafting and design, among others. Blackstone Unit Group BX, +1.36% has experience in Germany working with the Hessian state government on a $1 billion wind farm. It could manage to do something similar in the U.S. to help build out the country's generation grid. And lastly, Automatic Data Processing ADP, +1.54% could get a boost processing more paychecks as the Obama plan would put 4 million people back to work.

In addition, we provide program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance, and systems integration and information technology services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government and also for national governments around the world. Our business focuses primarily on providing fee-based planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design services and, therefore, our business is labor intensive. We primarily derive income from our ability to generate revenue and collect cash from our clients through the billing of our employees' time spent on client projects and our ability to manage our costs. AECOM Capital primarily derives its income from real estate development sales. We report our business through four segments: Design and Consulting Services (DCS), Construction Services (CS), Management Services (MS), and AECOM Capital (ACAP). Such segments are organized by the types of services provided, the differing specialized needs of the respective clients, and how we manage the business. We have aggregated various operating segments into our reportable segments based on their similar characteristics, including similar long-term financial performance, the nature of services provided, internal processes for delivering those services, and types of customers. Table of Contents Our DCS segment delivers planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design services to commercial and government clients worldwide in major end markets such as transportation, facilities, environmental, energy, water and government. DCS revenue is primarily derived from fees from services that we provide, as opposed to pass-through costs from subcontractors. Our CS segment provides construction services, including building construction and energy, infrastructure and industrial construction, primarily in the Americas. CS revenue typically includes a significant amount of pass-through costs from subcontractors. Our MS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance, and systems integration and information technology services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government and also for national governments around the world. MS revenue typically includes a significant amount of pass-through costs from subcontractors. Our ACAP segment invests in real estate, public-private partnership (P3) and infrastructure projects. ACAP typically partners with investors and experienced developers in the United States and Europe as co-general partners. In addition, ACAP may, but is not required to, enter into contracts with our other AECOM affiliates to provide design, engineering, construction management, development and operations and maintenance services for ACAP funded projects. Our revenue is dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified and productive employees, identify business opportunities, integrate and maximize the value of our recent acquisitions, allocate our labor resources to profitable and high growth markets, secure new contracts and renew existing client agreements. Demand for our services is cyclical and may be vulnerable to sudden economic downturns and reductions in government and private industry spending, which may result in clients delaying, curtailing or canceling proposed and existing projects. Moreover, as a professional services company, maintaining the high quality of the work generated by our employees is integral to our revenue generation and profitability. Our costs consist primarily of the compensation we pay to our employees, including salaries, fringe benefits, the costs of hiring subcontractors, other project-related expenses and sales, general and administrative costs. During our first quarter ended December 31, 2017, President Trump signed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act legislation that went into law (Tax Act). The Tax Act reduces the Company's U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to a blended tax rate of 24.5% for the Company's fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 and 21% for fiscal years thereafter, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings and eliminates or reduces certain deductions. We have not completed our accounting for the tax effects of the Tax Act. We have made a reasonable estimate of the effects on our existing deferred tax balances and the one-time transition tax but we have not made any reasonable estimate of the impact on our indefinite reinvestment of earnings of certain of our foreign subsidiaries. In December 2015, the federal legislation referred to as the Fixing America's Surface Transportation Act (the FAST Act) was authorized. The FAST Act is a five-year federal program expected to provide infrastructure spending on roads, bridges, and public transit and rail systems. While client spending patterns are likely to remain uneven, we expect that the passage of the FAST Act will positively impact our transportation services business in the next several years. In 2017, the U.S. federal government proposed significant legislative and executive infrastructure initiatives that, if enacted, could have a positive impact to our infrastructure business. In September 2017, we announced our plan to allocate free cash from operations to reduce our long-term debt and lower our overall leverage ratio. After significantly reducing our leverage ratio, we plan to allocate free cash from operations to engage in a stock repurchase program. We cannot determine if future climate change and greenhouse gas laws and policies, such as the United Nation's COP-21 Paris Agreement, will have a material impact on our business or our clients' business; however, we expect future environmental laws and policies could negatively impact demand for our services related to fossil fuel projects and positively impact demand for our services related to environmental, infrastructure, nuclear and alternative energy projects.

The increase in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to increases in our DCS segment of $101.1 million, our CS segment of $375.3 million, and our MS segment of $76.1 million, as discussed further below. In the course of providing our services, we routinely subcontract for services and incur other direct costs on behalf of our clients. These costs are passed through to clients and, in accordance with industry practice and GAAP, are included in our revenue and cost of revenue. Because subcontractor and other direct costs can change significantly from project to project and period to period, changes in revenue may not be indicative of business trends. Subcontractor and other direct costs for the quarters ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $2.6 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Subcontractor costs and other direct costs as a percentage of revenue, increased to 53% during the quarter ended December 31, 2017 from 52% during the quarter ended December 31, 2016 due to increased building construction in our CS segment, as discussed below. Table of Contents Gross Profit Our gross profit for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $33.8 million, or 19.9%, to $136.2 million as compared to $170.0 million for the corresponding period last year. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, gross profit, as a percentage of revenue, decreased to 2.8% from 3.9% in the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a the absence of an approximately $35 million benefit recorded in the three months ended December 31, 2016 from the settlement of the Waste Treatment Plant qui tam civil lawsuit filed pursuant to the federal False Claims Act, net of legal fees. Billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts includes a margin fair value liability associated with long-term contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of URS on October 17, 2014. Revenue and the related income from operations related to the margin fair value liability recognized during the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $1.1 million, compared with $1.6 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016. This is offset by amortization of intangible assets of $23.7 million during the three months ended December 31, 2017, compared with $25.4 million during the three months ended December 31, 2016. We do not expect the margin fair value liability recognized in recent business acquisitions will have a significant impact to gross margin in future periods. Gross profit changes were also due to the reasons noted in DCS, CS and MS reportable segments below. Equity in Earnings of Joint Ventures Our equity in earnings of joint ventures for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $29.7 million as compared to $21.4 million in the corresponding period last year. Equity in earnings of joint ventures for the three months ended December 31, 2017 benefited from a gain from the acquisition of a previously unconsolidated joint venture in our CS segment. General and Administrative Expenses Our general and administrative expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased $2.1 million, or 6.4%, to $34.7 million as compared to $32.6 million for the corresponding period last year. As a percentage of revenue, general and administrative expenses was 0.7% of revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 and the corresponding period last year. Acquisition and Integration Expenses Acquisition and integration expenses, resulting from business acquisitions, were comprised of the following: Three months ended December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 (in millions) Severance and personnel costs $ - $ 11.5 Professional service, real estate-related, and other expenses - 3.9 Total $ - $ 15.4  Our acquisition and integration expenses associated with the URS integration are complete. Other Income Our other income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased to $2.3 million from $0.8 million for the corresponding period last year. Other income is primarily comprised of interest income. Interest Expense Our interest expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased to $56.2 million as compared to $53.6 million for the corresponding period last year. Table of Contents Income Tax Expense Our income tax (benefit)/expense for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $(47.1) million as compared to $24.8 million in the corresponding period last year. The decrease in tax expense for the current period compared to the corresponding period last year is due primarily to a tax benefit of $41.7 million related to one-time U.S. federal tax law changes, a $11.2 million benefit related to changes in uncertain tax positions primarily in the U.S. and Canada, a $8.4 million benefit related to income tax credits and incentives, and a $6.3 million benefit related to the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to a blended tax rate of 24.5%. These items are not expected to have a continuing impact on the effective tax rate for the remainder of the fiscal year except for the benefits related to income tax credits and incentives. During the first quarter of 2018, President Trump signed what is commonly referred to as The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) into law. The Tax Act reduces our U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to a blended tax rate of 24.5% for the Company's fiscal year ending September 30, 2018 and 21% for fiscal years thereafter, requires companies to pay a one-time transition tax on accumulated earnings of foreign subsidiaries, creates new taxes on certain foreign sourced earnings and eliminates or reduces certain deductions. In the first quarter of 2018, we remeasured certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, we are still analyzing certain aspects of the Tax Act and refining our calculations which could potentially affect the measurement of these balances. The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was a $36.1 million tax benefit. In addition, we released the deferred tax liability and recorded a tax benefit related to certain foreign subsidiaries for which the undistributed earnings are not intended to be reinvested indefinitely for $77.0 million and accrued current tax on these earnings as part of the one-time transition tax. Also during the first quarter 2018, we recorded a provisional amount for the one-time transition tax liability for our foreign subsidiaries resulting in an increase in income tax expense of $71.4 million. We have not yet completed our calculation of the total foreign earnings and profits of our foreign subsidiaries. Further, the transition tax is based in part on the amount of those earnings held in cash and other specified assets at the end of the current fiscal year. This amount may change when we finalize the calculation of foreign earnings and finalize the amounts held in cash or other specified assets. Certain operations in Canada continue to have losses and the associated valuation allowances could be reduced if and when our current and forecast profits trend turns and sufficient evidence exists to support the release of the related valuation allowance (approximately $27 million). We regularly integrate and consolidate our business operations and legal entity structure, and such internal initiatives could impact the assessment of uncertain tax positions, indefinite reinvestment assertions and the realizability of deferred tax assets. Net Income Attributable to AECOM The factors described above resulted in net income attributable to AECOM of $111.3 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017 as compared to net income attributable to AECOM of $47.2 million for the three months ended December 31, 2016.

The increase in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was attributable to increases in Europe, Middle East, India and Africa (EMIA), Asia Pacific (APAC), and the Americas, totaling approximately $70 million, as well as a favorable impact from foreign currency of approximately $30 million. Gross Profit Gross profit for our DCS segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017 decreased $17.4 million, or 18.3%, to $77.8 million as compared to $95.2 million for the corresponding period last year.

The increase in revenue for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to approximately $240 million in increased revenue due to the construction of residential high-rise buildings in the city of New York and sports arenas in the Americas. Additionally, the increase was due to the inclusion of approximately $160 million of revenue from entities acquired during fiscal year 2018 and 2017.

ACM,"Mass Equities, Inc. (MEQ), a private equity real estate investment firm based in Santa Monica, California, and AECOM Capital, the investment arm of AECOM ACM, +2.59% announce a new partnership for the development of MEQ’s prominent 2017 property acquisition in Denver’s emerging River North (RiNo) Art District. The 7.8-acre site will be home to a Class A mixed-use development that reimagines an existing structure in combination with approximately 522,000 square feet of new construction that will both enhance and blend with the future growth of the neighborhood. “We are pleased that AECOM Capital has joined us on this exciting project, demonstrating the significance of this development and the importance of RiNo in the overall Denver community,” said MEQ Founder Andrew (Drew) Sobel. “We look forward to a collaboration that will benefit from AECOM’s depth of knowledge, experience and global network of experts, to augment and inspire the outstanding MEQ team to accomplish a new kind of mixed-use development that will resonate in tune with RiNo’s dynamism,” he added. “We are excited to bring a full suite of services to bear on this project, leveraging both AECOM’s established construction expertise and AECOM Capital’s design and development experience,” said Michael S. Burke, AECOM’s chairman and chief executive officer. “We are firm believers in Denver’s tremendous market potential given the city’s substantial and diverse growth in employment, and its booming millennial population. We look forward to partnering with MEQ to bring its incredible vision to life in RiNo.” The dramatic transformation of this underutilized industrial property will be the largest to date in the rapidly evolving RiNo district submarket. The US$200+ million first phase of the project will include the repositioning of the existing 62,000-square-foot building located at 3060 Brighton Boulevard into a state-of-the-art creative office building, taking advantage of the soaring and dramatic ceiling heights and open space already existing in the building. In addition, and as part of the initial plan, MEQ and AECOM Capital expect to develop approximately 480 apartment units, approximately 64,000 square feet of new creative office space, and over 33,000 square feet of much-needed retail space in the otherwise retail-starved RiNo area along Brighton. Led by Mr. Sobel and AECOM Capital Managing Director Ted Fentin, the RiNo development is the first joint MEQ and AECOM Capital project.AECOM will also serve as construction manager on the project through its AECOM Hunt business, in partnership with Denver-based Martines Palmeiro Construction (MPC). The value of the contract is expected to be included in AECOM’s backlog for its second quarter of fiscal year 2018. With its artistic roots, and proximity to lower downtown and greater downtown Denver, RiNo is a truly unique neighborhood lending itself to MEQ’s vision of a carefully curated community filled with “passion, personalities and purpose.” The RiNo Art District started as a grassroots movement by local artists who wanted to connect the arts organizations in the area in a distinctive area of north Denver that includes four historical neighborhoods: Globeville, Elyria-Swansea, Five Points and Cole. The neighborhoods’ rapid growth has led to the creation of the Business Improvement District (BID) and General Improvement District (GID) to help local area merchants and residents. “Across the country, neighborhoods that are undergoing gentrification have encountered various challenges. MEQ and AECOM have intelligently planned to address every aspect of the project and its interactions with the RiNo environment,” said Mr. Sobel. “We are confident that this exciting project will succeed on its own merits and will enhance the living fabric of this Art District,” he added.

The segment's constant-currency organic revenue grew by 5% and included strong performance in the Company's transportation and water markets in the America. For Q1 FY18, DCS' operating income was $85 million compared to $99 million in Q1 FY17. On an adjusted basis, the segment's operating income was $92 million versus $108 million in the year ago comparable period. The segment's reported quarter results included $21 million for previously-disclosed restructuring costs. For Q1 FY18, the Construction Services (CS) segment's revenue totaled $2.13 billion, up 21.8% compared to $1.75 billion in Q1 FY17. The segment's constant-currency organic revenue advanced 11% on a y-o-y basis, led by continued strong growth in the Building Construction and Power businesses. In Q1 FY18, CS division's operating income was $40 million compared to $18 million in Q1 FY17. On an adjusted basis, the segment's operating income soared 104% to $51 million compared to $25 million in the year ago same period, driven by the Power and Building Construction businesses and the recently-acquired Shimmick Construction business. During Q1 FY18, the Management Services (MS) segment's revenue was $843.45 million, up 9.9% compared to $767.34 million in Q1 FY17. The segment's organic revenue advanced 10% on a y-o-y basis, reflecting strong business momentum and the successful conversion of the Company's record backlog into revenue. The segment's operating income was $40 million in Q1 FY18 compared to $74 million in Q1 FY17. On an adjusted basis, the segment's operating income totaled $50 million compared to $87 million in the year ago same period. Excluding a $35 million benefit from a legal settlement disclosed in the year ago corresponding period, adjusted operating income would have been effectively unchanged from the prior year. Wins and Backlog AECOM's wins were $6.1 billion in Q1 FY18 and resulted in a book-to-burn ratio of 1.2. The Company's wins were highlighted by strength across the business, including greater than 1 book-to-burn ratios in the DCS, CS, and MS segments.

Net income and diluted earnings per share were $111 million and $0.69 in the first quarter, respectively. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share [1] was $0.57.

Wins of $6.1 billion included book-to-burn [5] ratios greater than 1.0 in all three segments, led by 1.5 and 1.2 in the higher-margin MS and DCS segments, respectively. Total backlog reached a new record of $49 billion, which is an 11% [3] year-over-year increase. Adjusted EBITDA [1] as reported would have increased by 18% after also excluding $22 million of restructuring costs in the quarter and a $35 million benefit from a legal settlement in the year-ago period. Reiterating fiscal 2018 adjusted EBITDA [1] guidance of $910 million and adjusted EPS [1] guidance of between $2.50 and $2.90. The Company remains on track to achieve 2.5x net debt-to-EBITDA [6] by the end of fiscal year 2018 and thereafter intends to return substantially all free cash flow to investors under a $1 billion stock repurchase authorization. “We are capitalizing on market momentum and the benefits of our investments in growth, as evidenced by continued strong organic revenue performance, more than $6 billion of wins for the third time in our history, and 11% backlog growth to a new record of $49 billion, led by our higher-margin MS and DCS segments,” said Michael S. Burke, AECOM’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Confidence across our markets is increasing and has been bolstered by the anticipated positive benefits of U.S. tax reform and improving economic growth expectations. As a result, we are reaffirming our industry-leading five-year financial targets through fiscal 2022, including a 5%+ organic revenue CAGR, a 7%+ adjusted EBITDA CAGR, a 12 – 15% adjusted EPS CAGR and at least $3.5 billion of free cash flow.” “Our strong first quarter results have us on track with our full-year financial goals, and we remain confident in creating substantial value for our investors through the execution of our strategy and capital allocation policy,” said W. Troy Rudd, AECOM’s chief financial officer. “Importantly, free cash flow was consistent with normal seasonality, highlighting the benefits of our diverse business model and our culture focused on risk management and driving cash flow. Accordingly, we are on track with our full year guidance for between $600 million and $800 million of free cash flow.” Wins and Backlog Wins were $6.1 billion, and resulted in a book-to-burn ratio [5] of 1.2. Wins were highlighted by strength across the business, including greater than 1 book-to-burn ratios in the DCS, CS and MS segments. Total backlog increased 11% [3] over the prior-year period to nearly $49 billion, and continued to reflect a favorable mix shift to the higher-margin DCS and MS segments. Business Segments Design & Consulting Services (DCS) The DCS segment delivers planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design services to commercial and government clients worldwide in markets such as transportation, facilities, environmental, energy, water and government. Revenue in the first quarter was $1.9 billion. Constant-currency organic [4] revenue increased by 5% and included strong performance in the Company’s transportation and water markets in the Americas, which are benefiting from improved funding and continued growth across international markets. Operating income was $85 million compared to $99 million in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, operating income [1] was $92 million compared to $108 million in the year-ago period. Results included $21 million for previously-disclosed restructuring costs. Excluding these costs, adjusted operating income was consistent with the Company’s expectation and would have increased by 4% from the prior year. Construction Services (CS) The CS segment provides construction services for energy, sports, commercial, industrial, and public and private infrastructure clients. Revenue in the first quarter was $2.1 billion. Constant-currency organic [4] revenue increased by 11%, led by continued strong growth in the Building Construction and Power businesses. Operating income was $40 million compared to $18 million in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, operating income [1] was $51 million compared to $25 million in the year-ago period, and was driven by the Power and Building Construction businesses and the recently-acquired Shimmick Construction business. Management Services (MS) The MS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems-integration services and information technology services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government, national governments around the world and commercial customers. Revenue in the first quarter was $843 million. Organic [4] revenue increased by 10%, reflecting strong business momentum and the successful conversion of the Company’s record backlog into revenue. Operating income was $40 million compared to $74 million in the year-ago period. On an adjusted basis, operating income [1] was $50 million compared to $87 million in the year-ago period. After excluding a $35 million benefit from a legal settlement disclosed in the year-ago period, adjusted operating income would have been effectively unchanged from the prior year. Tax Rate The effective tax rate in the first quarter was (61%). On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was (0.05%). The adjusted tax rate was derived by re-computing the expected annual effective tax rate on earnings from adjusted net income. [7] The adjusted tax expense differs from the GAAP tax expense based on the taxability or deductibility and tax rate applied to each of the adjustments, and excluded the discrete items related to U.S. tax reform, as noted below. Financial Impacts of Tax Reform AECOM’s first quarter GAAP financial results included the following impacts from discrete tax items resulting from the U.S. tax reform, which was signed into law on December 22: The revaluation of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in a $113 million benefit. A one-time tax repatriation toll charge of $71 million was accrued. The impact from these discrete tax items was excluded from AECOM’s fiscal first quarter adjusted earnings per share and fiscal 2018 adjusted earnings per share guidance. For the full year, the Company now expects an effective tax rate for adjusted earnings of approximately 20% compared to prior guidance of 21%. The reduction in the tax rate guidance reflects the benefit from a lower corporate tax rate on U.S. earnings for 9 months of the fiscal year, which will contribute to adjusted earnings per share. Cash Flow Operating cash flow for the first quarter was $52 million and free cash flow [2] was $34 million. The Company remains on track with its annual free cash flow guidance of $600 million to $800 million for fiscal 2018. Balance Sheet As of December 31, 2017, AECOM had $813 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $3.1 billion of net debt and $915 million in unused capacity under its $1.05 billion revolving credit facility. Financial Outlook AECOM’s fiscal year 2018 financial guidance is as follows:     Fiscal Year 2018 Outlook Adjusted EBITDA [1]     $910 million Adjusted EPS [1]     $2.50 – $2.90 Free Cash Flow [2]     $600 million – $800 million Interest Expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing fees)     $210 million Amortization [8]     $90 million Full-Year Share Count     162 million Effective Tax Rate for Adjusted Earnings [7]     ~20% Capital Expenditures [9] $110 million   Conference Call AECOM is hosting a conference call today at 12 p.m. Eastern Time, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the Company's results, strategies and operating trends.

All statements in this press release other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including any projections of earnings, revenue, cash flows, tax rate, share count, interest expense, capital expenditures, amortization of intangible assets and financial fees, acquisition and integration expense, or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives for future operations; and any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: impacts of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Acts, our business is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns and client spending reductions; we are dependent on long-term government contracts and subject to uncertainties related to government contract appropriations; governmental agencies may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts; government contracts are subject to audits and adjustments of contractual terms; we may experience losses under fixed-price contracts; we have limited control over operations run through our joint venture entities; we may be liable for misconduct by our employees or consultants or our failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to our business; we may not maintain adequate surety and financial capacity; we are highly leveraged and may not be able to service our debt and guarantees; we have exposure to political and economic risks in different countries where we operate as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations; we may not be able to retain and recruit key technical and management personnel; we may be subject to legal claims and we may have inadequate insurance coverage; we are subject to environmental law compliance and we may have inadequate nuclear indemnification; there may be unexpected adjustments and cancellations related to our backlog; we are dependent on partners and third parties who may fail to satisfy their obligations; we may not be able to manage pension costs; we may face cybersecurity issues and data loss; as well as other additional risks and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements set forth in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement. This press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In particular, the Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted tax rate, adjusted interest expense, organic revenue, and free cash flow also provide a meaningful perspective on its business results as the Company utilizes this information to evaluate and manage the business. We use adjusted EBITDA, net and operating income to exclude the impact of non-operating items, such as amortization expense, taxes, acquisition and integration expenses, and non-core operating losses. We use free cash flow to represent the cash generated after capital expenditures to maintain our business. Our non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is found in the Regulation G Information tables at the back of this release. When we provide our long term projections for organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS growth, and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, the closest corresponding GAAP measure and a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectation and the corresponding GAAP measure generally is not available without unreasonable effort due to length of the forecasted period and potential high variability, complexity and low visibility as to items that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period.

Burke, AECOM’s chairman and chief executive officer. “Importantly, we anticipate creating over $4 billion of capacity from our robust five-year free cash flow forecast and forecasted adjusted EBITDA growth to enhance stockholder value, including our commitment to achieving 2.5x net leverage [4] , which is expected by the end of fiscal 2018, and thereafter executing our $1 billion stock repurchase authorization.” “Our new five-year outlook reaffirms our confidence in continued strong cash flow generation, which reflects the benefits of our diverse business model and our culture focused on cash management throughout the lifecycle of a project,” said W.

Forward-Looking Statements and Non-GAAP Measures All statements in this press release other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including any estimates or projections related to our EPS growth, capital allocation policy, future debt reductions and net leverage, future stock repurchases, future acquisitions, cumulative free cash flow projections and any other statements regarding our future business performance. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our business is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns and client spending reductions; we are dependent on long-term government contracts and subject to uncertainties related to government contract appropriations; governmental agencies may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts; government contracts are subject to audits and adjustments of contractual terms; we may experience losses under fixed-price contracts; we have limited control over operations run through our joint venture entities; we may be liable for misconduct by our employees or consultants or our failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to our business; we may not maintain adequate surety and financial capacity; we are highly leveraged and may not be able to service our debt and guarantees; we have exposure to political and economic risks in different countries where we operate as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations; we may not be able to retain and recruit key technical and management personnel; we may be subject to legal and claims and inadequate insurance coverage; we are subject to environmental law compliance and may not have adequate nuclear indemnification; there may be unexpected adjustments and cancellations related to our backlog; we may be impacted by changes in U.S. tax laws; we are dependent on partners and third parties who may fail to satisfy their obligations; we may not be able to manage pension costs; we may face cybersecurity issues and data loss; as well as other additional risks and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements set forth in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement. When we provide our five year projections for non-GAAP measures such as organic revenue growth, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS growth, and free cash flow on a forward-looking basis, the closest corresponding GAAP measure and a reconciliation of the differences between the non-GAAP expectation and the corresponding GAAP measure is not available without unreasonable effort due to length of the forecasted period and potential high variability, complexity and low visibility as to items such as future contingencies, asset impairments and other costs that would be excluded from the GAAP measure in the relevant future period. Footnotes [1] Organic growth is at constant currency and excludes revenue associated with acquisitions and business dispositions. [2 ] Excluding financing charges in interest expense and the amortization of intangible assets. In addition, EBITDA is defined as net income, attributable to AECOM, excluding interest expense and income, taxes, depreciation and amortization. [3 ] Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures net of proceeds from disposals. [4 ] Net debt-to-EBITDA is comprised of EBITDA as defined in the Company’s credit agreement, which excludes stock-based compensation, and net debt as defined as total debt on the Company’s financial statements, net of cash and cash equivalents.

ACM,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 13, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- AECOM ACM, +2.59% a premier, fully integrated global infrastructure firm, today reported fourth quarter revenue of $4.9 billion and full year revenue of $18.2 billion. Net income and diluted earnings per share were $88 million and $0.55 in the fourth quarter, respectively. Net income and diluted earnings per share were $339 million and $2.13 for the full year. On an adjusted basis, diluted earnings per share [1] was $0.74 for the fourth quarter and $2.94 for the full year.

Achieved record full year wins of $23.2 billion, resulting in an all-time high backlog of $47.5 billion driven by the higher-margin DCS and MS segments. Generated strong operating cash flow of $697 million and free cash flow [2] of $618 million, which was within the Company’s guidance range for the year; cumulative three year free cash flow was $2.0 billion. Initiated fiscal 2018 adjusted EBITDA [1] guidance of $910 million and adjusted EPS [1 ] guidance of $2.50 – $2.90, reflecting strong 7% EBITDA growth and 10% EPS growth at the mid-point after normalizing for benefits from tax and legal resolutions in fiscal 2017. Expect strong cash performance in fiscal 2018 with free cash flow [2] between $600 million and $800 million, consistent with the Company’s fiscal 2017 – 2021 $3.5 billion cumulative free cash flow forecast. “Our performance in fiscal 2017 was highlighted by strong cash flow, record backlog, and accelerating revenue growth, which serve as clear evidence that our diverse business and design, build, finance and operate vision are delivering results,” said Michael S. Burke, AECOM’s chairman and chief executive officer. “We entered fiscal 2018 with substantial momentum, which is reflected in our guidance for strong underlying earnings growth and cash flow performance. In addition, we are focused on stockholder value creation through our new capital allocation policy, which includes continued debt reduction to achieve net leverage of 2.5x, followed by an expectation to repurchase stock under a recently-authorized $1 billion stock repurchase program.” “We delivered strong free cash flow within our annual guidance range, and we continued to reduce our debt and strengthen our balance sheet,” said W. Troy Rudd, AECOM’s chief financial officer. “As a result of our strong progress to date on our five-year $3.5 billion cumulative free cash flow forecast and our confidence in the outlook for our business, in September we announced a long-term capital allocation policy that includes substantial returns of capital to stockholders and preserves the strength of our balance sheet.” Wins and Backlog Full year wins were $23.2 billion, which set a new high, and resulted in a book-to-burn ratio [6] of 1.2, as the Company’s fully integrated offering, leading capabilities and scale created competitive advantages on large pursuits, including the San Onofre nuclear decommissioning project and a large, global design-build win in the fourth quarter for a multi-national pharmaceutical company. Wins were $4.9 billion in the fourth quarter, which resulted in a book-to-burn ratio [6 ] of 0.9, highlighted by strong contributions from the DCS Americas and Management Services businesses. Total backlog increased 11% [3] over the prior-year period to $47.5 billion, including a record high backlog level in the DCS segment, 47% growth in Management Services and the addition of $1.4 billion in the fourth quarter from the Shimmick acquisition. Business Segments In addition to providing consolidated financial results, AECOM reports separate financial information for its four segments: Design & Consulting Services, Construction Services, Management Services, and AECOM Capital. Design & Consulting Services (DCS) The DCS segment delivers planning, consulting, architectural and engineering design services to commercial and government clients worldwide in markets such as transportation, facilities, environmental, energy, water and government. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.0 billion. Constant-currency organic [4] revenue increased by 4%. Full year revenue was $7.6 billion, and constant-currency organic [4] revenue was unchanged over the prior year. Performance reflects improving trends in the Americas driven by transportation and water markets. Fourth quarter and full year operating income was $106 million and $412 million, respectively. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter and full year operating income [1] was $116 million and $448 million, respectively, resulting from solid underlying execution and revenue growth, partially offset by increased investment in business development that resulted in strong backlog growth. Construction Services (CS) The CS segment provides construction services for energy, sports, commercial, industrial, and public and private infrastructure clients. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $2.0 billion. Constant-currency organic [4] revenue increased by 21%. Full year revenue was $7.3 billion, and constant-currency organic [4] revenue increased by 11%, highlighted by the third-consecutive year of double-digit growth in the Building Construction business and strong growth in the Power business. Fourth quarter and full year operating income was $38 million and $115 million, respectively. On an adjusted basis, fourth quarter and full year operating income [1] was $49 million and $150 million, respectively, which was driven by strong performance in the Building Construction and Power businesses and improved performance in the Oil & Gas business. Management Services (MS) The MS segment provides program and facilities management and maintenance, training, logistics, consulting, technical assistance and systems-integration services and information technology services, primarily for agencies of the U.S. government, national governments around the world and commercial customers. Revenue in the fourth quarter was $890 million. Organic [4] revenue was up slightly over the prior year period. Full year revenue was $3.3 billion, and organic [4] revenue decreased by 1%. Operating income was $48 million and $241 million in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. On an adjusted basis, operating income [1] was $61 million and $293 million in the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. Revenue and operating income in the prior year included a significant positive impact from the accelerated recovery of a government pension entitlement resulting from the harmonization of the Company’s benefit programs. Excluding this benefit, full year revenue and adjusted operating income increased slightly over the prior year, reflecting strong execution across the Company’s vast and diverse portfolio of projects. AECOM Capital (ACAP) The ACAP segment invests in real estate, public-private partnerships (P3), and infrastructure. Operating income in the fourth quarter was $7 million. Full year operating income was $49 million, driven by the Company’s first investment monetization, which closed during the fiscal third quarter. ACAP manages a diverse portfolio that includes numerous active investments and $230 million of committed capital. Tax Rate The effective tax rate was 5.6% and 1.8% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. On an adjusted basis, the effective tax rate was 9.6% and 9.5% for the fourth quarter and full year, respectively. The Company’s full year tax rate included the net impact from a reversal of a deferred tax asset in the fiscal second quarter, the Company’s decision in the third quarter to indefinitely reinvest a portion of its non-U.S. undistributed earnings for which tax had previously been provided, and tax planning in the fiscal fourth quarter. For the full year, the net impact to the Company’s EPS from tax variances to initial guidance was approximately $0.34. The adjusted tax rate was derived by re-computing the expected annual effective tax rate on earnings from adjusted net income. [7] The adjusted tax expense differs from the GAAP tax expense based on the taxability or deductibility and tax rate applied to each of the adjustments. Cash Flow Operating cash flow for the fourth quarter was $251 million and free cash flow [2] was $231 million. For the full year, AECOM generated operating cash flow of $697 million and free cash flow [2] of $618 million, which was within the Company’s guidance of $600 million to $800 million for a third consecutive year. Balance Sheet and Capital Allocation As of September 30, 2017, AECOM had $802 million of total cash and cash equivalents, $3.1 billion of net debt and $992 million in unused capacity under its $1.05 billion revolving credit facility. Total debt has declined by $1.4 billion since closing the URS acquisition in October 2014. During the fiscal fourth quarter, AECOM announced a formalized capital allocation policy and the authorization by the Company’s Board of Directors of a new $1 billion stock repurchase program. Key features of the capital allocation policy include the following: Allocating substantially all free cash flow [2] to debt reduction until achieving net debt-to-EBITDA [5] of 2.5x, which is expected to occur by the end of fiscal year 2018. Upon achievement of 2.5x net leverage, the Company intends to return substantially all free cash flow to investors through the new $1 billion stock repurchase authorization as part of the longer-term capital allocation framework. Acquisitions are expected to be limited to strategic, niche targets that will not adversely impact the Company’s 2.5x net leverage target. Financial Outlook AECOM is initiating fiscal year 2018 financial guidance as follows:       Fiscal Year 2018 Outlook Adjusted EBITDA [1]       $910 million Adjusted EPS [1]       $2.50 – $2.90 Free Cash Flow [2]       $600 million – $800 million Interest Expense (excluding amortization of deferred financing fees)       $210 million Amortization [8]       $90 million Full-Year Share Count       162 million Effective Tax Rate for Adjusted Earnings [7]       21% Capital Expenditures [9] $110 million   Included in the Company’s fiscal 2018 guidance is approximately $20 million to $25 million of costs to drive additional efficiencies across the enterprise, which are anticipated to be primarily incurred during the first quarter of fiscal 2018. Conference Call AECOM is hosting a conference call today at 12 p.m. EST, during which management will make a brief presentation focusing on the Company's results, strategies and operating trends. Interested parties can listen to the conference call and view accompanying slides via webcast at http://investors.aecom.com. The webcast will be available for replay following the call.

All statements in this press release other than statements of historical fact are “forward-looking statements” for purposes of federal and state securities laws, including any projections of earnings, revenue, cash flows, tax rate, share count, interest expense, capital expenditures, amortization of intangible assets and financial fees, AECOM Capital realizations, acquisition and integration expense, or other financial items; any statements of the plans, strategies and objectives for future operations; and any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance. Although we believe that the expectations reflected in our forward-looking statements are reasonable, actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in any of our forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our actual results, performance and achievements, or industry results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in our forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: our business is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns and client spending reductions; we are dependent on long-term government contracts and subject to uncertainties related to government contract appropriations; governmental agencies may modify, curtail or terminate our contracts; government contracts are subject to audits and adjustments of contractual terms; we may experience losses under fixed-price contracts; we have limited control over operations run through our joint venture entities; we may be liable for misconduct by our employees or consultants or our failure to comply with laws or regulations applicable to our business; we may not maintain adequate surety and financial capacity; we are highly leveraged and may not be able to service our debt and guarantees; we have exposure to political and economic risks in different countries where we operate as well as currency exchange rate fluctuations; we may not be able to retain and recruit key technical and management personnel; we may be subject to legal claims and we may have inadequate insurance coverage; we are subject to environmental law compliance and we may have inadequate nuclear indemnification; there may be unexpected adjustments and cancellations related to our backlog; we are dependent on partners and third parties who may fail to satisfy their obligations; we may not be able to manage pension costs; we may face cybersecurity issues and data loss; as well as other additional risks and factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements set forth in our reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not intend, and undertake no obligation, to update any forward-looking statement. This press release contains financial information calculated other than in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). In particular, the Company believes that non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EPS, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating income, adjusted tax rate, adjusted interest expense, organic revenue, and free cash flow also provide a meaningful perspective on its business results as the Company utilizes this information to evaluate and manage the business. We use adjusted EBITDA, net and operating income to exclude the impact of prior acquisitions and dispositions. We use free cash flow to represent the cash generated after capital expenditures to maintain our business. Our non-GAAP disclosure has limitations as an analytical tool, should not be viewed as a substitute for financial information determined in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under GAAP, nor is it necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures that may be presented by other companies. A reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is found in the Regulation G Information tables at the back of this release.
