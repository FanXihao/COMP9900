OCN,"WASHINGTON — Regulators sued Ocwen Financial Corp., alleging the mortgage-servicing firm harmed thousands of customers by botching basic services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said the company specializing in subprime and delinquent loans had illegally foreclosed against at least 1,000 borrowers. The federal consumer watchdog alleged Ocwen also ignored customer complaints and failed to make disclosures about errors in borrowers’ records when selling off the servicing rights to their loans to other companies. For years, Ocwen failed to properly implement a wide range of basic functions to service home loans, the CFPB said. The services Ocwen botched, according to the consumer watchdog, included sending accurate monthly statements, properly crediting payments, and handling taxes and insurance. Mortgage servicers handle payment collection, loan modification and foreclosures. Ocwen said it “strongly disputes” the CFPB’s claims and vowed to “vigorously defend itself,” adding that “the substantive allegations in today’s suit are inaccurate and unfounded.” Ocwen OCN, -0.73%   shares tumbled on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $2.49, down 54%.

OCN,"Ocwen Financial swung to a much deeper-than-expected loss in its latest quarter, marking the third straight quarterly loss for the beleaguered mortgage-servicing company. Shares tumbled 21% in after-hours trading. Through Wednesday's close, the stock had erased 64% of its value closing at $2.84 a share. In the wake of regulatory problems, the West Palm Beach, Fla., company has pared down its mortgage-servicing rights and shifted its focus to mortgages not owned by government agencies, selling off assets and reducing its workforce. Earlier this year, Ocwen paid $2 million to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission over charges that it used flawed methodology to value mortgages and lacked proper accounting controls. On Wednesday, the company attributed the steep quarterly loss to the impact of sales of agency mortgage servicing rights and to higher monitoring costs. Ocwen said it would continue to try to improve costs in order to help stabilize the business. Over all, the company reported a quarterly loss of $111.3 million, or 90 cents a share. A year earlier, Ocwen posted a profit of $34.4 million, or 27 cents a share. Revenue dropped 35% to $330.8 million. Analysts projected a loss of 39 cents a share and $346.3 million in sales, according to Thomson Reuters.

All of these companies had fairly complicated structures, and that sucked in some egos among the big fund names, who have been paying the price with share losses. “And while piles of money are burning in the Valeants and Ocwens and SunEdisons, very quietly, the S&P 500 Low Volatility Index makes record highs. It is an index comprised of companies making cookies for a nickel and selling them for a dime,” said Brown.

That ETF is up 6.5% over 12 months and 30% over three years, compared with the S&P 500’s 0.4% drop and 32% gain, respectively. So it’s a beat on the year at least. Brown says gains for U.S. blue chips, Treasury bond indexes and investment-grade corporate bonds also bear out that simple investment idea. “At any given moment, there will always be a complex solution gaining adherents around The Street and making outsiders look as though ‘they just don’t get it,’” he says.

OCN,"Correcting a comment from J.P. Morgan spokesman in the 10th paragraph SIGTARP Mortgage servicers reject 72% of struggling borrowers from a federal program aimed at creating more affordable monthly mortgage payments. WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Mortgage servicers reject 72% of struggling borrowers from a federal program aimed at creating more affordable monthly mortgage payments so owners can keep their homes, a federal watchdog reported Wednesday. “All cannot be right,” said the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a federal bailout enacted in 2008 to protect the U.S. and financial firms from a financial tsunami. According to the inspector’s quarterly report to Congress, Citigroup Inc. C, -0.56% has rejected 87% of applications for TARP’s Home Affordable Modification Program, which aims to make mortgages more affordable by changing terms, such as interest rates and loan duration. J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -2.68%  has rejected 84% of applications, Bank of America Corp. BAC, -3.13%  has rejected 80% and Ocwen Fianncial Corp. OCN, -1.46% has rejected 70%. “There is a massive lost opportunity for an emergency program designed to help homeowners through the crisis if only 20% to 30% of families seeking help from HAMP actually get into HAMP,” said Christy Romero, special inspector general. Moreover, the U.S. Treasury Department’s requirements for servicers to explain why borrowers were rejected “do not give a clear picture of why homeowners were denied,” the report said. Also, the report noted that officials have found that servicers have “wrongfully denied” borrowers from entering HAMP. “Persistent problems and errors in the application and income calculation process (servicers calculate a homeowner’s income) have historically plagued homeowners seeking HAMP assistance, and continue to do so,” the report said. Read more: Here’s why mortgage modifications have changed dramatically in last year The watchdog said Citi “has had one of the worst records of non-compliance” with Treasury’s guidance for reviewing applications, failing to meet benchmarks in most reviews. “Citi is the only large active servicer that has ever been rated as needing ‘substantial improvement’ with respect to denial determinations,” the report said. A Citi spokesman said the company has “consistently addressed issues” in quarterly performance reports, “and has fully implemented corrective action plans to remedy them.” A J.P. Morgan Chase spokesman said Chase “has achieved the Treasury’s highest overall MHA compliance scorecard rating for six of the last seven quarters. “We believe today’s reported findings are based on an inaccurate analysis of Treasury data, and that both HAMP and our participation in HAMP have helped to achieve the program’s goals.” ‘Known problems with servicer misconduct’ Top reasons for servicers rejecting HAMP applications are homeowners who don’t provide all the documentation in a timely manner as well as homeowner income that is too high to qualify for the program, even though there are “known problems with servicer misconduct” in these areas, the watchdog report said. “It is Treasury’s responsibility to ensure that mortgage servicers participating in HAMP treat homeowners fairly and do not wrongfully deny homeowners who should have gotten into the program,” the watchdog report said. “Top HAMP servicers are still mistreating homeowners by not following HAMP rules designed to protect homeowners.” Treasury should do more to reduce high denial rates for HAMP, the report said. “Despite these extensive and continuing problems — documented in many cases by Treasury’s own servicer assessments — Treasury has never permanently withheld TARP incentive payments from any servicer,” the report said. Mark McArdle, Treasury’s chief for homeownership preservation, said the department has “robust compliance procedures” to see whether servicers are following program requirements. “We have seen significant improvement in servicers’ compliance with program guidelines, including proper evaluation and denial decisions,” McArdle said. HAMP is badly missing its original goals for helping homeowners. In 2009, when HAMP was announced, the administration had forecast that the program would help up to four million struggling borrowers by modifying their loans. Yet servicers have rejected about four million of the roughly 5.7 million HAMP applicants, the report said. “The problem does not appear to be that not enough homeowners are applying for HAMP, but that not enough homeowners are getting into HAMP,” the report said. “There is evidence that sometimes an ‘incomplete’ application is not always the fault of the homeowner, but that of the servicer.” In a prior report on HAMP, the inspector general found that Treasury has done far too little in certain housing markets to help troubled homeowners. States such as Texas, Michigan and North Dakota had many more foreclosures for each HAMP modification than elsewhere, and Treasury had done too little outreach in certain areas, the report said.

OCN,"Ocwen Financial Corp. disclosed Monday that it is negotiating with lenders to extend and refinance some of its debt. In a regulatory filing, the embattled mortgage-servicing company said it looking to renew, replace or extend debt arrangements that mature or begin amortization this year. The company said it is also considering selling and financing advance receivables. The company warned if it is unable able to change the debt arrangements, it could face a liquidity crunch. ""Due to the significant level of cash requirements related to servicing advances, we may not have sufficient levels of liquidity to fund the operations without our advance financing facilities,"" the company said in the filing. Ocwen has been plagued by regulatory problems and other challenges for the past two years, including a December settlement with New York state regulators over alleged improper servicing practices for distressed borrowers. The company had delayed filing its 10-K over problems related to the financial status of its Home Loan Servicing Solutions Ltd. affiliate, which had put it in jeopardy of having its shares delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The company is trying to cut its risk exposure by selling off servicing rights for mortgages owned by government-supported Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Earlier this month, the company said it had avoided a ""going concern"" opinion from its auditor that could have raised questions about the company's ability to survive--a move that Ocwen said indicates it is on the rebound.

OCN,"Ocwen Financial Corp. estimated its first-quarter profit dropped 43%, results that come after a year of steep regulatory hurdles and continuing questions from its auditor about its financial viability. The mortgage servicing company said in the announcement of its preliminary results, which were unaudited, that it had a profit of $34.4 million, or 27 cents a share, down from $60.5 million, or 43 cents a share, a year earlier. Ocwen posted revenue of $510.4 million, down 7% from the year earlier. This is the second quarter that Ocwen has had to report preliminary, unaudited results because its accountants have raised questions about the mortgage servicer's ability to continue as a going concern. ""We made great progress on our asset sale strategy, have returned to profitability and continue to generate substantial operating cash flow,"" Chief Executive Ron Faris said. ""However, I am not satisfied with only making $34 million in the quarter. We intend to do better."" Earlier this month, Ocwen said it had a preliminary loss of $546 million, or $4.18 a share, for 2014. Ocwen was hit with an array of charges in 2014, totaling $728.1 million that included write-downs and legal costs, among other things. Thursday's results follow a challenging year in which Ocwen was forced to pay $150 million to settle regulatory charges that it mishandled distressed borrowers and its executive chairman, William Erbey, was forced to resign. In addition, some big investors in securities in which Ocwen services the underlying mortgages sought to have the servicing agreement transferred to another company, alleging that Ocwen had performed poorly. Ocwen has rejected those charges. In the wake of the regulatory actions, Ocwen announced it was selling off the servicing rights to mortgages owned by government-supported entities and would focus instead on what are known as non-agency mortgages.

OCN,"Ocwen Financial Corp. reported a preliminary $598.4 million loss in its fourth quarter on a heavy write-down, though the embattled mortgage-servicing company said it expects to return to profitability in 2015. Ocwen has delayed filing its annual report, and as a result has been threatened with a possible delisting by the New York Stock Exchange. Ocwen said Tuesday that its results are preliminary and could change. It said it doesn't have an estimate for when its 2014 financial statements will be finalized. The results come as the embattled mortgage-servicing company faces a series of challenges. The company agreed in December to pay $150 million, and William Erbey, its executive chairman, agreed to step down after New York state's Department of Financial Services alleged Ocwen had engaged in improper servicing practices for distressed-mortgage borrowers and had questionable dealings with affiliated companies. Since then, Ocwen has said it would sell off its servicing rights for mortgages owned by the government-supported entities Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and focus on so-called nonagency mortgages. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Ocwen reported a loss of $598.4 million, or $4.77 a share, compared with a profit of $134.3 million, or 95 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter's result included a write-down of $420.2 million and $113.9 million in professional services. Total revenue fell 11.3% to $$493.3 million. Analysts had projected a 35-cent profit and $498.4 million in revenue, according to Thomson Reuters. Write to Chelsey Dulaney at chelsey.dulaney@wsj.com Access Investor Kit for Ocwen Financial Corp.

OCN,"Ocwen Financial Corp. said on Thursday that it expects to report a loss for the fourth quarter and for all of 2014 as regulatory problems mounted, but that it has substantial cash on hand and a ""significant"" positive cash flow. In response to the firm's statement, Ocwen's stock rose about 13% Thursday morning, but it was still down about 50% this year. The mortgage-servicing firm said it has $249 million in cash on hand ""and our cash forecast indicated that we will continue to have sufficient liquidity going forward."" The firm also said that it set up a new $125 million financing line ""with a large bank"" in late December backed by advances from private-label securities. Ocwen didn't identify the bank. Ocwen, which grew aggressively after the financial crisis, said that it would record a $50 million expense in the fourth quarter to cover part of a $150 million settlement with New York State regulators in December. It had previously set aside $100 million for that settlement. In addition, Ocwen said that it would record $64 million in expenses for uncollectable receivables in the fourth quarter, but that such expenses will ""decrease significantly"" in 2015. The result will be a record loss for the company in the fourth quarter of 2014 and for all of 2014. The firm also said that, in line with a previous announcement, it expects to sell from $5 billion to $20 billion of servicing rights per month through the end of 2015. It said it could start closing on transactions in the second quarter. Earlier, the firm said that it would be selling its servicing rights for mortgages backed by government agencies. Ocwen had a string of regulatory problems last year and in early 2015 with New York State and California, and eventually settled those problems with agreements. Ocwen said that it wasn't aware of any further significant actions by state regulators. It said it is subject to routine exams and that it is currently aware of 21 pending examinations underway in 15 states.

OCN,"Wells Fargo & Co. is scheduled to kick off fourth-quarter earnings season for large-cap U.S., banks on Wednesday. While analysts expect a major decline in trading revenue for the nation’s biggest banks, this should have little effect on the San Francisco lender. Investors will be looking for a strong pace for commercial loan growth, following a strong fourth quarter for the industry. Earnings: Wells Fargo WFC, -2.50%  is expected to report fourth-quarter net income of $5.49 billion, or $1.02 a share, according to analysts polled by FactSet. This compares to earnings of $5.41 billion, or $1.02 a share, in the third quarter, and $5.37 billion, or $1.00 a share, during the fourth quarter of 2013. For all of 2014, Wells Fargo is expected to report earnings of $22.10 billion, or $4.09 a share, increasing from $20.89 billion, or $3.89 a share, in 2013. Revenue: Analysts expect fourth-quarter revenue of $21.23 billion, rising from $21.21 billion the previous quarter and $20.67 billion a year earlier. The expected industry trend for significantly lower trading revenue isn’t expected to have an effect on Wells Fargo, which derives only about 2% of its annual revenue from this source. Fourth-quarter trading revenue is estimated to total $383 million, compared with $168 million in the third quarter and $325 million a year earlier. Revenue from fees and commissions is expected to total $10.10 billion for the fourth quarter, down from $10.28 billion the previous quarter, but up from $9.86 billion a year earlier. Jefferies analyst Ken Usdin expects the increase in fourth-quarter trading revenue to more than make up for “the seasonal decline in mortgage banking revenues.” Wells Fargo is expected by analysts to show another slight decline in its net interest margin, which is the spread between a bank’s average yield on loans and investments less its average costs for deposits and wholesale borrowings. Usdin expects a fourth-quarter margin of 3.02%, narrowing from 3.06% in the third quarter and 3.15% in the fourth quarter of 2013. The challenge for banks in the current environment is to grow loans fast enough not only to enjoy origination fee income, but to offset the decline in net interest income as margins continue to soften for most industry players. The Federal Reserve has kept the short-term federal funds rate locked in a range of zero to 0.25% since late 2008. Banks aren’t going to see much more of a benefit on the funding cost side, with rates near zero for so long. And on the long end of the rate curve, the decline in commodity prices and strong U.S. dollar have combined to send the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury notes US:10_YEAR  down to 1.95% from 2.17% at the end of 20214 and 3.04% at the end of 2013. Despite the narrowing margin, loan growth is expected by analysts to help Wells Fargo grow its fourth-quarter net interest income to $11.15 billion from $10.94 billion the previous quarter and $10.80 billion a year earlier. Expenses: Fourth-quarter noninterest expenses are expected to total $12.19 billion, declining from $12.25 billion in the third quarter, but rising from $12.09 billion during the fourth quarter of 2013. TimeWells Fargo & Co.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:WFC $50 $55 $60 $65 The Stock: Wells Fargo’s stock is down 5% this year through Monday’s close at $52.05. The stock’s total return for 2014 was 24%, with dividends reinvested. Based on a quarterly payout of 35 cents, the shares have a dividend yield of 2.69%. Wells Fargo significantly outperformed its big four rivals during 2014, with returns on common equity (ROCE) of 13.98% for the first three quarters. This compares to ROCE for the first three quarters of 8.32% for J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -2.14% 5.16% for Citigroup Inc. C, -0.07% and just 2.98% for Bank of America Corp. BAC, -2.72% Wells Fargo’s stock trades for 11.4 times the consensus 2016 earnings estimate of $4.61 among analysts polled by FactSet. This is the highest forward price-to-earnings ratio among the big four, which again is no surprise, considering the company’s long track record of higher returns on equity. Out of 32 analysts polled by FactSet, only 11 rate Wells Fargo at “buy,” or “overweight.” The consensus 12-month price target is $56.08, implying 8% upside. Key Issues: In addition to commentary on loan growth, investors will be looking for Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf to discuss the continually evolving mortgage lending business, as well as the company’s efforts to manage expenses. Wells Fargo said last month it would hold on to the servicing rights on $39 billion in mortgage loans that it had previously planned to sell to Ocwen Financial Corp.

OCN,"Shares of beleaguered mortgage-servicing firm Ocwen Financial Corp. plummeted more than 30% Tuesday on concerns that California was seeking to suspend the firm’s business license in the state, its largest market. California’s Department of Business Oversight initially filed last October an order to suspend Ocwen’s license after the company failed to provide records requested as part of a routine examination to make sure it was complying with a law protecting homeowners going through foreclosures, loan modifications and other legal procedures, said Tom Dresslar, an agency spokesman. The problem follows what has been a series of investigations and penalties by New York state regulators over Ocwen’s practices regarding distressed mortgage borrowers and relations with its affiliated companies. New York penalized Ocwen $150 million and, in December, forced the company’s executive chairman and largest shareholder, William Erbey, to resign. The stock OCN, -0.36%  has fallen more than 80% in the past year. With Ocwen’s California issue, reported Monday by the Los Angeles Times, an administrative judge hearing the case gave Ocwen until Dec. 1 to comply with the records request, but the company failed to provide the documents, Dresslar said. An Ocwen spokeswoman said that the company had recently complied with the order. An expanded version of this report appears at WSJ.com.

OCN,"Getty Images Is Santa still coming? NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ended Monday at new records, fueled by continued hopes that the Federal Reserve won’t be in a rush to raise interest rates. The main indexes booked their fourth straight day of gains, abetted by a central bank that last week reassured investors it will be “patient” about the timing and pace of rate hikes. The S&P 500 SPX, -2.08%  gained 7.9 points, or 0.4%, to 2,078.55, closing at a record for the 50th time this year. This is the highest number of record closes in a year since 1995. Gains in technology and telecom stocks outweighed sharp losses in energy and health-care companies. Gains were even larger for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.93% which rose 154.64 points, or 0.9%, to 17,959.44. The blue-chip index closed at a record for the 35th time in 2014. All but three of its 30 components ended with gains. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, -2.27%  ended 16 points, or 0.3%, higher at 4,781.42. “There seems to be an overall upward bias, but something rational is happening to the stocks. Trading action is not at all uniform, which is a good sign, as companies are being valued for their fundamentals,” said Kim Caughey Forrest, senior analyst and portfolio manager at Fort Pitt Capital Group. Market reaction to mixed economic data was largely muted. Sales of existing homes in November slowed down to the weakest pace in six months, in a further sign that the housing market remains fragile. Separately, a report on economic growth from the Chicago Fed came in stronger than expected. Michael Arone, chief investment officer at State Street Global Advisors, said years of low interest rates are beginning to benefit consumers, with the fall in energy prices leaving many Americans with extra cash. “The exciting news is that we are seeing signs of wage growth along with strong labor market, which is great news for consumers. And revival on Main Street will be good for Wall Street,” Arone said. Also read: Gas prices have fallen for a record 88 straight days Oil prices reversed gains after a firmer start in the global day.

Shareholders in the company were jolted by the developments, as shares OCN, +0.00%  fell 14% in morning trading. Mr. Erbey “was the main architect of the corporate structure we see today,” wrote Kevin Barker, an analyst with Compass Point Research and Trading, in a note to clients. “His resignation will surely cause some of the investor base to question whether they will continue to support the company given that Erbey will not be there to steer the company through the new regulatory landscape.” TimeOcwen Financial Corp.15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:OCN $3.0 $3.5 $4.0 $4.5 The company said it plans to record a $50 million charge in the fourth quarter to cover the settlement’s final cost.

In a letter sent to Ocwen OCN, +0.24%   Tuesday morning, New York’s Superintendent of Financial Services, Benjamin Lawsky, said that even after an employee at the firm discovered and reported the backdating, Ocwen ignored it for months and still hasn’t corrected it, nearly a year after it was found. “Ocwen’s indifference to such a serious matter demonstrates a troubling corporate culture that disregards the needs of struggling borrowers,” Lawsky said in the letter. An Ocwen spokeswoman said: “We deeply regret the inconvenience to borrowers who received improperly dated letters as a result of errors in our correspondence systems. As always, our goal is to avoid foreclosure.” She added that Ocwen, one of the country’s largest mortgage servicers, believes it has fixed the problems it has identified, and is continuing to investigate.

OCN,"Portfolio Recovery Associates is a hot, but little-known, stock, up more than 3% today after an upgrade by Janney Capital Markets. The company had disappointed investors by reporting first-quarter earnings of $40.8 million, or 81 cents a share, increasing from $38.6 million, or 75 cents, a year earlier. The consensus among analysts polled by FactSet was 84 cents. But when breaking down the numbers and listening to what Chief Executive Officer Steve Fredrickson has to say, you can’t help but consider putting money in this small-cap company. After all, the stock has more than doubled the returns of its index in the past five years. And it’s not in an inherently risky business like some other small-caps. Portfolio Recovery Associates Inc. PRAA, -0.66%  of Norfolk, Va., buys portfolios of nonperforming or charged-off loans, mainly in the United States and the United Kingdom. The company has a deal in place to expand its operations in Europe through the purchase of Aktiv Kapital of Oslo for $880 million in cash. Portfolio Recovery Associates will also take on Aktiv Kapital’s debt of $435 million, for a total value of $1.3 billion. The purchase is expected to be completed by the end of June and is being funded through a combination of cash on hand and borrowing. When the deal was announced in February, CEO Steve Fredrickson said he expected the “transformative” deal to be “immediately accretive to earnings.” The business of buying servicing rights for stressed mortgage-loan portfolios in the U.S. boomed after the credit crisis of 2008, with many players, including Ocwen Financial Inc. OCN, +0.49%  expanding exponentially by buying huge blocks of servicing rights from several of the nation’s largest lenders. The mortgage servicers are now under a great deal of scrutiny, with New York Superintendent of Financial Services Benjamin Lawsky saying in a speech Tuesday that he remained concerned over the expansion of mortgage servicers, and that his department would broaden its investigations. Portfolio Recovery Associates is different from Ocwen because, in addition to providing collection and related services (including repossession and skip tracing) to banks, governments and retailers, it buys pools of problem loans (not just the servicing rights) at a discount, and then seeks to recover as much as possible through collection efforts. Because it owns these portfolios and doesn’t resell them, the company can be patient with recovery efforts. At this point in the credit cycle, “the supply of available debt to acquire in the U.S. remains lower in years past,” Fredrickson said in the company’s first-quarter earnings press release, which helps explain the need for a massive expansion into Europe. Janney Capital Markets analyst Sameer Gokhale upgraded Portfolio Recovery Associates to “buy” from “neutral,” with a fair value estimate of $60, implying 11% upside from Thursday’s closing price of $53.03. Of eight analysts who cover the company, six have “buy” ratings and two “hold” ratings. The shares look cheap, trading for 11.4 times the consensus 2015 EPS estimate of $4.64. The consensus 2014 EPS estimate is $3.87. Still, the stock is flat year-to-date through Thursday, following a 48% return in 2013 and a 58% surge in 2012. The stock’s five-year total return is 385%, more than double that of the S&P 600 SmallCap Index. Here’s a more interesting point for investors looking ahead — Portfolio Recovery Associates’ first-quarter return on common equity (ROCE) was 21.38%, increasing from 20.37% a year earlier, according to FactSet. The 2013 ROCE was higher, at 22.22%, but the first-quarter number is very impressive, and the consistent ROCEs above 20 mean there’s plenty of support for the stock price and plenty of earnings to support its expansion. Meanwhile, the company has grown its annual sales per share for 10 straight years, which takes us back to 2005, well before the U.S. credit crisis began. Fredrickson in February said he expected the Aktiv deal to help Portfolio Recovery Associates “meet or exceed our twin goals of 20% ROE and 15% EPS growth, delivering long-term shareholder value through the years ahead.” If he is right in this prediction, investors have an opportunity to buy a long-term winner at a discount. Portfolio Recovery Associates’ financing of the Aktiv deal through debt is good news for shareholders, who aren’t being diluted by a deal that is expected to add to earnings this year. According to Gokhale, Portfolio Recovery Associates’ leverage following the Aktiv deal and associated borrowings will be “approximately two times debt-to-adjusted EBITDA (including their deferred tax liability as debt).” The analyst believes the company could decide to lever up further, to 3.1 times EBITDA, which would free up an additional $1 billion that could be deployed through more acquisitions, purchases of debt portfolios or share buybacks. Gokhale also sees another possible growth opportunity for Portfolio Recovery Associates, since there is “the chance that three of the large debt sellers who exited the market could start selling charged-off receivables in 2014 or 2015.” More must-reads from MarketWatch: 5 ‘dividend champ’ stocks with the highest yields Charles Schwab, the man, is an ETF fan Value stocks for investors who fear the worst More from MarketWatch How to Get a Job: Advice From Extremely Successful People More Coverage Bloodbath for cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin sheds 10%, now down 40% year-to-date Damn the torpedoes — what could take the S&P 500 to 3,000 Jobless claims drop 4,000 to 226,000 Related Topics Markets U.S. Stocks Mutual Funds Exchange Traded Funds","May 23, 2014 1:35 p.m. ET",1,Repo-man stock recovers money for investors,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/repo-man-stock-recovers-money-for-investors-2014-05-23
OCN,"AFP/Getty Images Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew arrives for the FSOC meeting WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — U.S. officials flagged nonbank mortgage-servicing companies as a potential emerging threat to financial stability in a new report to Congress. The annual report of the Financial Stability Oversight Council says the U.S. financial system continued to recover from the financial crisis over the past year, but “significant risks remain.” The report of the council, which was created by the Dodd-Frank law, identifies recurring threats including the vulnerability of wholesale funding markets and interest-rate volatility. “Our job is not done,” said Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen at the council’s public meeting on Wednesday. “We must continue our collective efforts” to monitor risks, she said. For the first time, meanwhile, the FSOC report highlights in its potential threats section nonbank mortgage servicers, which have been handling more loans as banks sell servicing rights. Earlier this year, Benjamin Lawsky, the superintendent of New York’s Department of Financial Services, stopped a deal by nonbank mortgage servicer Ocwen Financial Corp. OCN, +0.73%  to buy a large mortgage-servicing portfolio from Wells Fargo & Co. over worries about Ocwen’s ability to handle more loans. The report doesn’t name company names. But it says: “While the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau] and state regulators have some authority over these companies, many of them are not currently subject to prudential standards such as capital, liquidity, or risk management oversight.” The FSOC is headed by Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew. Other FSOC members include Yellen, CFPB Director Richard Cordray, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Jo White and Federal Housing Finance Agency Director Mel Watt. Regarding the inclusion of nonbank mortgage servicers, a source familiar with FSOC said the council didn’t see a pending emergency but said regulators need to monitor how growth is occurring and what risks and unintended consequences there could be for the financial system. The report also identified other post-financial crisis innovations that the council’s member agencies are monitoring to understand risks and benefits. Those include asset managers’ providing indemnification to securities lenders as part of their securities lending business, and securitization of income from single-family rental properties. The newest report is the council’s fourth.

OCN,"Ocwen Financial Corp. said its fourth-quarter earnings jumped 60%, after the New York Department of Finance said it is examining the mortgage-servicing company over concerns that it is growing too quickly. The department of finance said the company's close relationships with other firms may harm borrowers, after it and other authorities alleged Ocwen and other nonbank mortgage-service firms have grown too quickly, resulting in many of the same problems for borrowers seen following the financial crisis, The Wall Street Journal reported this week. ""We are working cooperatively with the New York Department of Financial Services to address its concerns that led to an indefinite hold on our transaction with Wells Fargo,"" said Chairman Bill Erbey on Thursday. He said the company has grown as prepayments trend lower, on its ability to help homeowners with foreclosure, and as an improved economy drives down loan delinquencies. For the fourth quarter, Ocwen reported earnings of $105.3 million, or 74 cents a share, up from $65.3 million, or 47 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue more than doubled to $556 million as its largest segment, servicing and subservicing fees, posted soaring revenue growth to $490.2 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected per-share earnings of 76 cents and revenue of $560 million. Meanwhile, the company's total operating expenses more than tripled to $340.9 million. The New York Department of Financial Services has been scrutinizing Ocwen's business amid concerns by the regulator that the company isn't equipped to handle the growth of its servicing portfolio. Earlier this month, Superintendent Benjamin Lawsky halted a deal in which Ocwen agreed to buy the rights to service $39 billion of mortgages from Wells Fargo & Co., citing concerns about the company's rapid growth.

OCN,"Wells Fargo & Co. on Wednesday said it would sell residential-mortgage servicing rights on $39 billion in loans to Ocwen Financial Corp. Financial terms of the deal weren't disclosed. The 184,000 loans formed about 2% of Wells Fargo's total residential-servicing portfolio as of the end of fourth quarter. The bank expects the sale to be completed this year. It said the transaction won't be material to financial results. The loans behind the residential-mortgage servicing rights sold are mainly owned by private investors and weren't originated or owned by Wells Fargo. Wells's move follows similar moves by other lenders who have been shedding parts of their mortgage businesses. Last year, government-owned auto lender Ally Financial Inc. said its bank had reached a deal to sell a portfolio of mortgage-servicing rights to Ocwen for an estimated $585 million. Wells Fargo has been working to limit its exposure to the mortgage market as a refinancing boom that boosted bank profits continues to fizzle. Last week, Wells Fargo--the largest mortgage lender in the U.S.--had profits for mortgage lending drop by 49% from the fourth quarter of 2012 to $1.6 billion. The bank's home-lending originations totaled $50 billion, compared with the $125 billion a year earlier and $80 billion in the previous quarter.

OCN,"Google is one place with a lot of folks who scorn the “let's make money for the shareholders” idea. And their share prices show it. Same with Wal-Mart: They used to be on a mission to charge low prices to create high profits. Then six years ago, someone decided they needed to start squeezing the carbon out of Wal-Mart's WMT, -4.20%  supply chain. They also squeezed out profits. At Ocwen Financial OCN, -0.24% you won't find any executives talking such silly stuff. And their prices show it too. So much so, OCN is today the #1 rated stock in my Best Stocks Now app. I have owned and talked about Ocwen many times over the last several years. Ocwen provides residential and commercial mortgage loans servicing, as well as asset-management services. And OCN has been growing its earnings over the last five years by 35% per year! . . . . . . . . . . . . . Data from Best Stocks Now app Performance Over the last 10 years, OCN has delivered 35% per year while the market has delivered 5% to investors. Over the last five years, OCN has delivered 67% per year, while the market has delivered 6%. Over the last three years, OCN has delivered 82% per year, while the market has delivered only 15% during the same time. And over the last 12 months, OCN is up 117% with the market up 18%. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Data from Best Stocks Now app And who has been putting their name on this stock for years? That's right — you can Google my name and find all the articles I have written and the radio minutes I have recorded about OCN. You can even take a look at my newsletter and see where the stock has been in my portfolios overtime. If you do it, it's not bragging. OCN has great performance in earnings and profits and sales. And that is all about management knowing it has to take care of business for its customers — and shareholders. Today, I give them a performance and momentum grade of A+. Valuation But what about value? OCN is currently trading at ten times forward earnings. It is expected to grow those earnings by 25% per year over the next five years. OCN also has a very favorable PEG ratio of 0.39. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Data from Best Stocks Now app Now we need to apply an appropriate multiple to those earnings to project a five-year target price. This is the hardest part of the equation. There are no set rules to go by here. Instead we must weigh the following factors in determining the multiple: 1. The current forward average P/E ratio of the 3,600 stocks that I track is 18.4 2. The current forward P/E ratio of OCN is 9.81. I next apply a very conservative multiple towards the potential future earnings of the shares. When I do this I get a five-year target price of $105 per share. The stock passes both my valuation and performance tests. Stock chart Is it too much to ask that a stock have a good chart on top of good performance and valuation? This is my final test. I want the best management, the best performance. I want to buy the stock at a reasonable price. And lastly, I want a good, healthy, stock chart. This is all I ask. The problem is, these requirements really narrows down the pickings. In fact, they narrow them down to only about 220 stocks out of the almost 3,600 stocks I follow. So for all these people looking for stocks in companies that do not seek to relentlessly improve profits and shareholder value: Good news: You have a lot to choose from. The other 3,380 stocks that do not get my top ratings. . . . . . Take a look at OCN's one-year chart — OCN has been in an uptrend, as it recently broke out of a sideways trend. It's also currently hitting new all-time highs. OCN was a $2 stock in 2008 and it is a $56 stock today, and I think it can go higher. It is a stock that I own at Gunderson Capital Management. And I fully expect to own it two years from now as well. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . Data from Best Stocks Now app Follow me on Twitter @billgunderson for a change in my opinion of this stock.

OCN,"Billionaire Julian Robertson is one of the most closely followed figures in finance, even after his official retirement from running Tiger Management several years ago. Robertson, who is notable in part because several ""Tiger Cubs"" who worked for him have gone on to become successful fund managers themselves, still files quarterly 13Fs with the SEC. We track his 13Fs alongside those of hundreds of other hedge funds as part of our work researching investment strategies; we've found that the most popular small cap stocks among hedge funds earn an average excess return of 18 percentage points per year (learn more about our small cap strategy) and our own portfolio based on this finding outperformed the S&P 500 by 33 percentage points in the last 11 months. It is also interesting to use 13Fs to see what top managers have been doing recently. We went through Robertson's 13F for the end of June and here are three things we noticed compared with the billionaire's previous filing: Satellites Two of Robertson's three largest holdings by market value at the end of the quarter were satellite radio company Sirius XM SIRI, -1.36% and satellite imagery provider DigitalGlobe US:DGI (His top pick, Valeant Pharmaceuticals VRX, -4.93% had seen little change in position size compared with three months ago.) Sirius is a fairly expensive stock, with trailing and forward earnings multiples of 50 and 32 respectively, so investors are depending on very high growth from the company. Good subscriber numbers led total revenue up 12% last quarter compared with the second quarter of 2012. Even with somewhat higher costs to acquire these subscribers and pay out royalties, pretax income grew by nearly 50% though EPS was only 2 cents for the quarter. Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors had owned a large stake in Sirius at the end of Q1. DigitalGlobe also leans towards being a more speculative name. The company was unprofitable in each of the first two quarters of 2013, and is expected to lose $1.13 per share in total for the year. Wall Street analysts predict that the company will recover next year, but even so the forward P/E is rather high at more than 60. DigitalGlobe isn't having a problem growing its business, as shown by large increases in sales, it is that higher COGS and SGA expenses are resulting in operating losses even so. Stephen Feinberg, John Zaro, and James Dinan are among DGI investors. Howard Hughes The billionaire initiated a position of about 200,000 shares in $4.2 billion market cap real estate developer Howard Hughes HHC, -1.24% The company's Master Planned Community business, which accounts for a slight majority of revenue, grew its sales by 27% in the second quarter of 2013 versus a year earlier and segment margins increased as well. Robertson is likely buying the stock on his belief in an improving real estate market, for residential real estate in particular. Pershing Square, managed by billionaire Bill Ackman, had owned 3.6 million shares of Howard Hughes at the beginning of April. Selling HCA The filing showed Robertson closing his entire position in hospital company HCA Holdings HCA, -1.70% which had been one of his five largest single-stock positions three months earlier. At a trailing earnings multiple of 13, HCA is priced fairly cheaply in terms of its historical results. However, the first quarter of 2013 was a poor one for the company and even with some growth last quarter compared with the same period in the previous year net income remained down on a year to date basis. Larry Robbins, David Tepper, and Paul Tudor Jones are among HCA shareholders. We would be interested in taking a closer look at HCA, but would need to become more confident that Q1 was a fluke and future results will be better. Howard Hughes is priced a bit aggressively for our taste, but it is certainly notable that Robertson is directly engaging the housing market rather than merely service providers such as Ocwen Financial OCN, -0.12% SiriusXM and DigitalGlobe also carry earnings multiples which should be too high to interest value investors.

OCN,"Shares remain in superb shape. The two-week, sideways drift in the averages is unofficially ""the correction,"" the market's way of unwinding an overbought state that needed some cooling off of the speculative sentiment which underpins it. For a larger chart, please click here. Chart created using TradeStation. ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2013. All rights reserved. That there has not been anything more than a 1.4% easing off the high in the Nasdaq says it better than anyone can. One can say all they want about how the country is broke and how the Federal Reserve created this bull market — correct on both counts — but the market does not care. And neither should an intermediate-term speculator. There is still a pessimism among investors who were harshly treated by two bear markets in the last decade. This may have the effect of extending this bull market, as increasing numbers throw in the towel and get in the water. This happened in the ‘90s until everyone was in the pool in March 2000. Caution was in the air Monday ahead of the three events that produce the most volatility in the markets. It is uncommon that they should be stacked one against the other for three days in a row. They are Wednesday's FOMC meeting, Thursday's ISM report, and Friday's nonfarm-payroll report (NFP). Many times it is the ISM number that provokes the bigger reaction during weeks in which the ISM precedes NFP. In any case, this will likely be one volatile week. Flexibility on the part of the speculator will be key. Beneath the surface, the overarching development at the moment is a number of the speculative growth-stock glamours spiking and then printing inside, or quasi-inside, days. This is where some of the crème de la crème is, and the pause reflects caution ahead of the Wednesday-Friday trifecta. One possible scenario is that these issues come out on Wednesday's FOMC announcement or Thursday's ISM release. They could come out Tuesday. Among the names, the unexpected is often telling. That Facebook FB, -2.76% on Monday was able to pack on a further gain of 4.2% on volume 176% above average, despite already being up 30% in a single session two days' prior, says something. It says something further that it managed this move on a day in which the averages and most issues were down — not to mention ahead of the week's trifecta of events. Why did this transpire? Don't know, don't care. All that matters is that FB did the unexpected and showed power when it was entitled to a rest. It printed an inside day on Friday and then broke higher on Monday, a session in which most of the other glamours eased. In 1999 or so, these reports began referring to FB's pattern as the ""give-and-go."" The idea is that a sharp move upward, when followed by a few days of tight, sideways action, would resolve itself with another break higher. An entry could then be made on a break of the ledge pattern, a consolidation consisting of four to 10 days. In FB's case, there was only one day of pause (Friday) before more institutions began what appears to be a renewed buying campaign in the stock. In any market, there are only so many liquid glamours that show expected earnings growth of a large magnitude. In the current cycle, this includes Tesla Motors TSLA, -4.91% LinkedIn US:LNKD Netflix NFLX, -4.88% and Facebook. Google GOOG, -3.07% which most analysts peg at an expected earnings growth rate of 9%/18% for '203 and '14, does not qualify. Any institution with a growth-stock mandate ""needs"" to own these liquid glamours if they want to keep up with the averages in a bull market, let alone outperform. These names are deeply liquid and all showing at least 35% expected growth for 2013 and '14. This participant took FB Monday after it came out. Entering FB right here at Monday's close of 35.43, and using Thursday's low of 32.75 would result in a 7.6% stop loss. This is considered extended if one were to use a full-sized position. If, however, a junior position was used initially, the de facto risk drops to about 3.8%. Worth considering around Monday's closing level for those aggressive speculators not in the issue.

All rights reserved 3D Systems DDD, -3.36% was noted here in the July 14 report (""A potential entrance above the May 31 high of 50.98 presents itself.""). It cleared this level Monday on volume 117% above normal. The earnings release is expected pre-open Tuesday. (It is to be noted that the price behavior in advance of an earnings release may not always reflect the outcome of the report, let alone the market's reaction to the report. While the market is right most of the time, it is not right all of the time.) At this point, DDD is worth watching but not acting on until after the report. For a larger chart, please click here.

Under Armour UA, -2.58%   is another chart that has the same pattern. The Nasdaq's up-and-tight behavior since this advance began five weeks ago normally correlates with richer quotations. Most glamours act well. An aggressive speculator should not be lulled into a sense of complacency. Flexibility should rule the day. Only the paranoid survive.

OCN,"Back on Oct. 14 of last year, I wrote an article about the big rebound taking place in the housing market. At that time, the building-and-construction sector was ranked number three (on a performance basis) among the 65 sectors that I track on a daily basis. This number-three sector ranking placed it right below the biotech and pharmaceuticals sectors. Since then the biotech and pharmaceuticals sectors have maintained their rankings at the top of the leader board, while the building-and-construction sector has fallen along with rising interest rates. Between then and now, I have bagged some good profits in building related stocks like Toro TTC, -3.97% the homebuilders ETF XHB, -3.75% Lumber Liquidators LL, -5.85% Trex TREX, -2.45% Howard Hughes HHC, -1.34%  and Watsco WSO, -1.64% I currently find the portfolios that I manage with very little exposure to this once red-hot sector. However, I do believe that we are still in the early innings of a rebound in housing. The market has finally entered into a consolidation phase after a torrid seven-month run. Several of the leading sectors, like the building-and-construction sector have had their momentum wings clipped for now, but I believe strongly that they will have their day in the sun soon again, however. When the market enters into a consolidation (sideways) trend, not all stocks go along with the program. Some, like Biogen BIIB, -4.09%  (pictured below) roll over into a heavy bout of profit-taking. That is why having a sell discipline is so import. Other stocks break out to new high ground despite a market that is finally cooling off. Once such stock is Ocwen Financial OCN, -0.24% I included Ocwen in my previously mentioned article from October of last year. At the time, I pointed out the huge performance differential between the company and the market over the long, intermediate and short term. The stock was even up 65.7% in 2008 when the S&P 500 was down 38.5%. I also pointed out at the time that Ocwen had a PEG ratio of just 0.26, and I had a five-year target price of $51 on the stock at the time. The shares were trading at $28.96 back then. Today the shares are trading at over $44 per share. The stock is up 28% since that article. That was then, this is now. What do the shares look like today?

OCN,"Julian Robertson, who became a billionaire through his success at Tiger Management and also groomed many ""Tiger Cubs"" who currently manage their own hedge funds, filed his 13F for the first quarter of 2013 in May. Even though the information in 13Fs is a bit old (they disclose many of an investor's long equity positions as of the end of the previous quarter), there are a couple ways to make use of this information. For one, we use 13Fs to develop investment strategies; we have found, for example, that the most popular small caps stocks among hedge funds generate an average excess return of 18 percentage points per year (learn more about our small cap strategy). We can also screen individual managers' top picks for stocks which have ""high upside potential"" in the sense of having low PEG ratios. Read on for Robertson's five largest positions in stocks with a five-year PEG ratio of 0.9 or lower (or compare these picks to his previous filings). Robertson reported a position of about 330,000 shares in Chicago Bridge & Iron CBI, -6.67%  . Wall Street analysts are expecting high earnings growth at the infrastructure services company: its forward earnings multiple is 12, with a PEG ratio of 0.7. A recent acquisition has caused large increases in revenue and adjusted operating income compared with a year ago. We'd note that Chicago Bridge & Iron has the Warren Buffett seal of approval: the stock was one of Berkshire Hathaway's new picks during Q1, with the holding company owning 6.5 million shares by the end of March (see more of Buffett's stock picks). According to the 13F, Robertson bought almost 450,000 shares of Citigroup C, -0.87%   after not having owned any shares of the bank at the beginning of 2013. Our database shows that Citi was one of the five most popular stocks among hedge funds during the first quarter of the year (find more of hedge funds' favorite stocks). While many large banks are attractively priced, Citi deserves mention for its combination of a discount to book value (the P/B ratio is 0.8), analyst optimism (as shown by its low PEG ratio) and the fact that it actually has been delivering growth with earnings up 30% in Q1 versus a year earlier. Ocwen Financial OCN, -0.36%   was another high upside potential pick. The $5.6 billion market cap company services mortgage loans, including subprime residential loans, and has been quite acquisitive recently. It is up 160% in the last year, and while its trailing earnings numbers don't look particularly strong compared with its valuation the sell-side is bullish with the result being a forward P/E of 8 and a PEG ratio well below 1. Billionaire James Dinan's York Capital Management initiated a position in Ocwen between January and March. Pine River Capital, White Elm Capital, and billionaire Steve Cohen's SAC Capital are also bullish about Ocwen Financial. According to the 13F, Robertson cut his stake in Qualcomm QCOM, -3.72%   by 14% but he still had a little over 270,000 shares in his portfolio at the beginning of April. Qualcomm carries trailing and forward earnings multiples of 18 and 13, respectively, and analyst expectations for continued growth imply a PEG ratio of 0.8. Indeed, both revenue and earnings from continuing operations were up about 20% or more in its most recent quarter compared with the same period in the previous year. Lone Pine Capital, managed by billionaire and Tiger Cub Stephen Mandel, was one major shareholder in Qualcomm. Robertson disclosed a new position in $7.7 billion market cap cruise liner Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL, -2.04%  . Business for Royal Caribbean hasn't been that bad, considering events in the cruise line industry, and the stock is currently valued at 11 times forward earnings estimates even with the stock up 48% in the last year. We'd note that Royal Caribbean is highly dependent on the broader economy with a beta of 2.8. John Thaler's JAT Capital Management also took a new position in the company, and was the largest shareholder out of the filers we track in our database.

OCN,"Shares hit the sweet spot of the six-month advance, the phase when, despite the move being obvious to everyone, they still go up. Institutions, which make or break the vast majority of the individual leaders, are on a mission. Day in and day out, accumulation, or institutional buying, transpires as an increased growth rate into 2014 is discounted. The Nasdaq Composite, up 12 days in the last 14, just put in its best 14-day performance in 19 months. To say it is just about Federal Reserve accommodation probably misses the point, though that plays an outsized role. If that was all it is, gold would be leading the parade.

The thesis of these reports, as expounded last autumn, is for the economy to gain steam due primarily to the housing sector's resurgence, as well as the low base it operates from. Secondarily, a resurgence in the industrial sector, driven by dimming energy costs, would also contribute. As was mentioned here, the result would be a market that would surprise — on the upside. It is to be noted, and hastily, that the above analysis is about as far as it goes around here. Nothing is used to take a trade besides the chart, earnings estimates and revenue growth. For there is nothing intellectual about trading. One does not need a fancy degree, nor any degree at all. All the market cares about is order flow. Its job is to fill orders. And it goes where the orders are. Among the names, Genesis Energy GEL, +0.81% operates in the midstream segment of the oil and gas industry, focusing on pipelines and storage among other areas. Most analysts anticipate earnings growth of 31% and 29% in 2013 and '14. GEL stock is up 43% year to date. Technically, price tried to clear a five-week base two weeks ago, but was rejected at the key psychological level of 50. The stock then pulled back for a couple of days before rebounding and breaking out on Wednesday. The breakout came on volume 52% above normal. Based on Wednesday's close, price is less than 2% above the entrance pivot of 50.31. It is, therefore, not considered extended, and is potentially buyable around this level, using a stop-loss of 6%-7% below entrance. GEL is on the less liquid side, with average volume of $14 million per day. For a larger chart, please click here. Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2013 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. Nationstar Mortgage Holdings NSM, -0.39% first noted here last August, provides mortgage services to the residential market. Most analysts slate 2013 and '14 earnings growth at 79% and 50%. These estimates were most recently revised upward. As can be expected given the torrid housing market in certain areas of the U.S., sequential quarterly revenue growth has been greater than any other company in memory. Technically, after coming public in March 2012 at 14, NSM moved up 166% in seven months. It then began digesting this gain in rather sloppy fashion. Currently, price is nearing the top of a 12-week cup base. On Monday and Tuesday, the stock rose on above-average volume of 152% and 186%, respectively. NSM offers a potential entrance for an aggressive speculator above 42.24, the top of its base. As always, a junior-sized initial position is preferred, from which an add-on position could be put on as price moves in the correct direction. A protective sell-stop is always used on all positions. The risk of any housing-related actor, such as Nationstar, is a slowdown in home sales. When one considers the plethora of monthly economic reports dealing with housing, it is easy to understand the volatility in these titles. For example, there are reports on housing starts, new-home sales, existing-home sales, and builder sentiment, to name some. This promises to be a volatile player. Like any glamour, the blemishes can be overlooked by some if the other qualities are redeeming enough. In NSM's case, these other qualities are growth, growth, and growth, namely the heavy rate of estimated earnings growth and the large revenue growth rate. For a larger chart, please click here. Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2013 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. Ocwen Financial OCN, -0.36% is another mortgage servicer. It, too, has been experiencing torrid growth thanks to the housing revival. The Street expects 2013 and '14 earnings growth of 240% and 19%. This is not as impressive as the steadier figures of NSM, however these are rough guesstimates that are subject to change, and not to be relied upon too heavily. The chart is what 80% of the decision is based upon, in any case. Ocwen's chart shows a 176% gain in five months last year. This move began in May and peaked in October, covering the prime home-selling season. This was exactly what happened with NSM. Technically, as with Nationstar, OCN is building a 12-week base. Twice in the last five sessions, the stock has shown volume greater than 100% above average on up days in price.

OCN,"Luxor Capital, a hedge fund with $3 billion in assets under management that is run by Christian Leone, has disclosed ownership of 1.2 million shares of Altisource Portfolio Solutions ASPS, -2.18% in a 13G filed with the SEC. This gives Luxor 5% of the total shares outstanding. We track quarterly 13F filings from hedge funds and other notable investors as part of our work developing investing strategies—we have found, for example, that the most popular small cap stocks among hedge funds outperform the S&P 500 by an average of 18 percentage points per year—and so by using our database we can see that the fund has bought all of its currently held shares since the beginning of 2013 (see Luxor's largest holdings from the end of December). Altisource Portfolio Solutions is a $2.1 billion market cap providing services related to the management of mortgage loan portfolios. In the first quarter of 2013, the company experienced a 7% increase in revenue versus a year earlier with net income increasing by a similar amount. Altisource earns a large share of its revenue from mortgage loan originator and servicer Ocwen Financial OCN, -0.49% and some of its past growth has come from Ocwen's acquisitions; if Ocwen continues to grow in this manner then we imagine that the company would continue to benefit. At current prices, Altisource trades at 20 times trailing earnings, making it apparent that investors do expect considerable earnings growth going forward. However, Wall Street analysts are so bullish that they consider the stock very undervalued at these levels: consensus earnings forecasts imply a forward P/E of only 11 and a five-year PEG ratio of 0.3. We don't think that investors should necessarily take those projections at face value, but a PEG ratio that low does leave a lot of room for Altisource to underperform sell-side expectations and still prove undervalued at current prices. It is also easy to see why Luxor would be so excited about the stock- it only needs to come close to analyst targets. We've already mentioned Leone's interest in the stock, and we've tracked other funds with interest in Altisource as well. Earlier this year Renaissance Technologies, whose founder Jim Simons is now a billionaire, had reported a position of 1.2 million shares. Check out Renaissance's stock picks. Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Omega Advisors had about 960,000 shares in its portfolio at the end of December after cutting its stake by 28% during the fourth quarter of 2012 (find Cooperman's favorite stocks). Billionaires Louis Bacon, Israel Englander, and David E. Shaw had small positions in the stock as well. Peers for Altisource include Fiserv FISV, -1.57% Lender Processing Services US:LPS and Walter Investment Management US:WAC These companies are expected to improve their bottom lines over the next couple of years as well: Walter is actually unprofitable on a trailing basis, with Fiserv and Lender Processing Services each featuring trailing earnings multiples of 20 or higher, but forward earnings estimates show all three companies in value territory or close to it. The highest forward P/E is Fiserv's, at 13. However, Fiserv saw its earnings decline by 11% last quarter compared with the first quarter of 2012 (revenue was up slightly); while Lender Processing Services did grow its earnings, this was entirely due to wider net margins (and therefore probably not sustainable) as revenue fell 3%. It is interesting that analysts are so excited about Altisource, to a much greater degree than the market. However, we'd note that in its most recent quarter there wasn't as much growth as we'd normally like to see considering where the stock is currently trading. As a result, it is probably best for investors to wait for another quarter or two of results and only buy the stock if it shows more positive signs for growth over the next several years.

OCN,"That old nemesis of shares — Europe — arose from the dead Monday, after an Italian election cast doubt on that nation's ability to implement austerity measures. The selling was enough to saddle the Nasdaq Composite with its third distribution day, all major, in the past week. The S&P, for its part, notched its second. Chart created using TradeStation. ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2013. All rights reserved. A general rule of thumb is that three to five distribution days in a one-week period is enough to flash a sign of caution. Practically speaking, ""a sign of caution"" translates to a speculator raising some cash, or in some cases moving to an all-cash position. A lot depends on the action of the cycle's leading stocks. With the S&P 500 off only 2.8% from last week's rally high and the Nasdaq Composite just 3.0%, it hardly seems a time to be running for the hills. That is, unless one is holding some of the speculative growth glamours. As noted in Thursday's report, the somewhat curious aspect of this three-month advance in the averages has been that only a few growth titles with good liquidity have moved up more than 25% from breakout. The ramification of this is that the more-modest post-breakout gains seen in growth leaders are scarcely enough to weather a 3%-5% short-term reaction in the averages, let alone an 8%-12% intermediate-term correction. As noted previously, growth issues tend to correct 1.5 to 2.5 times that of the averages, if not more, in many cases. The current growth leadership is the type of generally lagging growth-stock performance that is consistent with the latter stages of a bull market. That cyclicals have led underscores this. Meanwhile, the action of the past week is an example of how volatility is mean-reverting. A period of low volatility, such as what was seen in the seven days highlighted in yellow in the above chart, tends to lead to a high-volatility period, as seen in the last four days. Increased volatility often signals a trend change. Following a trend change from down to up, it usually continues early into a new advance and also late in one. The view here is that the mild reaction thus far is likely to extend longer than the four days already seen, and for two reasons: 1) the median decline from peak for a universe of 56 growth titles is close to three times that of the declines in the averages, and 2) the reaction to the Italian election was extreme in the currency market, reflective of a shoot-now, ask-questions-later type of sentiment among global participants. Other concerns also persist. For starters, the housing-related shares account for 25% of the leaders. Any serious dent to their charts would suggest an impairment to the economic expansion. In addition to the builders, which are off 8.6% on average... Chart created using TradeStation. ©TradeStation Technologies, 2001-2013. All rights reserved.

OCN,"--Ally Bank looking to shed mortgage-servicing rights and business lending operations --Ally Financial has been distancing itself from the mortgage business and selling international operations --ResCap sold assets at bankruptcy auctions this week (Adds details throughout.) Ally Financial Inc. said Friday its banking unit is exploring strategic options for its mortgage assets as the government-owned lender continues to distance itself from the housing market. The assets include a $122 billion portfolio of servicing rights tied to mortgages backed by Freddie Mac FMCC, +5.37% and Fannie Mae FNMA, +6.38% It is also seeking a potential sale of an operation that buys mortgages from other lenders, known as correspondents, and wholesale brokers. ""Going forward our goal is to focus on our customer-centric deposit activities as well as supporting Ally's auto finance operation,"" Barbara Yastine, president and chief executive officer of the Midvale, Utah-based Ally Bank, said in a statement. The move is Ally Financial's latest action to distance itself from the mortgage business, which has bogged the company down in litigation. The company wants to shed assets to speed up repayment of a U.S. government bailout that topped $17 billion. In May, the company's mortgage subsidiary, Residential Capital LLC, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy as bond payments loomed and litigation over soured mortgage securities mounted. Ally, which isn't part of the bankruptcy, would gain a release from litigation and other liabilities under pending settlements reached as part of ResCap's bankruptcy. ResCap sold separate mortgage-servicing and origination assets to Ocwen Financial Corp. OCN, -0.97% and a loan portfolio to Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (BRKA, BRKB) as part of two bankruptcy auctions this week. The deals, which are subject to bankruptcy court approval, collectively are set to generate about $4.5 billion for ResCap's estate. Ally has also been shedding international assets, a move that coincided with ResCap's bankruptcy. This week it announced it was selling its Canadian auto-lending and deposit operations to Royal Bank of Canada (RY, RY.T) for $4.1 billion. Earlier this month it said it was selling its Mexican insurance business, ABA Seguros, to Swiss insurer Ace Ltd. ACE, +2.34% for $865 million. Ally, the former financing arm for General Motors Co. GM, -2.20% is trying to focus on its U.S. auto-lending business, which provides financing to customers and dealers of GM, Chrysler Group LLC and other manufacturers, and its online bank, which offers deposit products directly to consumers. The company said Friday that the bank will continue to originate a ""modest level of high-quality residential jumbo mortgages"" for its own portfolio through correspondents and wholesale brokers. Ally last year began scaling back its activities with correspondent lenders, which are typically smaller banks that originate loans and sell them to larger players, like Ally. In July, it announced it would exit warehouse lending, which it expects to complete by year end.

OCN,"Nationstar Mortgage Holdings Inc. NSM, -0.39% said Wednesday it did not top Ocwen Financial Corp. OCN, -0.97% in a bidding war for the mortgage-servicing assets of lender Residential Capital, which is in bankruptcy proceedings. The assets went to auction Tuesday as part of the bankruptcy proceedings for ResCap, a subsidiary of government-owned auto lender Ally Financial Inc. ResCap filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May as billions of dollars of bond payments loomed and litigation over soured mortgage securities mounted. Nationstar's shares were down 15% at $29.65 in recent trading. Nationstar and Ocwen were the only two bidders competing for ResCap's mortgage-servicing and -origination platform, which includes the rights to service 2.4 million mortgages that account for $374 billion in unpaid balances. The companies have been scooping up in recent months the mortgage-servicing assets of large banks that are exiting the business because of new regulations and capital requirements. Bidding on the assets extended into Wednesday, as both companies sought to top each other's offers. ""Price matters,"" said Nationstar Chief Executive Jay Bray in a statement. ""Obviously we are disappointed in the outcome of the auction, but in the end our judgment was that the price of the assets would not represent a compelling investment opportunity for us."" Nationstar did not disclose what its final bid was and the companies didn't disclose the size of the winning bid. The Wall Street Journal--citing people attending the auction--reported late Tuesday that Nationstar had submitted a $2.67 billion, bid which topped a bid of $2.65 billion by Ocwen. Nationstar, majority-owned by private-equity firm Fortress Investment Group LLC FIG, +0.00% was designated as the stalking horse bidder for ResCap's assets earlier this year by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The designation entitles the company to a breakup fee. ResCap would have doubled the assets of Nationstar, putting it on equal footing with Ocwen. For Ocwen, already the biggest player, a win would make the company more than three times as big as Nationstar. Ally, which isn't part of the bankruptcy proceedings, hopes to sever itself from ResCap's bond and litigation matters so it can focus on repaying a U.S. government bailout that topped $17 billion. -Christian Berthelsen and Melodie Warner contributed to this article.

Lennar LEN, -4.72% is up 160% over the last 12 months, while Toll Brothers TOL, -3.91% is up 132%, and D R Horton DHI, -4.68% is up 131%. The exchange-traded fund ITB, -4.14% that corresponds to the Home Construction Index is up 118% over the last 12 months, while Fidelity's Construction & Housing Mutual Fund FSHOX, +1.34% is up 59.5%. The obvious question is this: Is it too late to cash in on the recovering housing market? For this reason, I recently interviewed Mick Pattinson, CEO of Barratt Homes in Southern California, and a grizzled veteran of many housing cycles over the years, on my daily radio show, Best Stocks Now. I have to admit, that I have taken this whole rebound in housing with a grain of salt. After all, this is an election year, and there is a lot of spin going on from both sides of the aisle. I fully expected Mr. Pattinson to tell me that all this rebound talk is really smoke and mirrors, don't buy into it. Instead, I heard just the opposite. He stunned me when he started off the interview by stating the following: ""Yes, this rebound is for real!"" I had to throw out my interview notes and punt instead. He then proceeded to lay out the facts one by one: the shadow inventory is almost gone; there has not been any significant construction of new homes for almost five years; the waiting time for an appraisal is getting longer and longer, and in some markets it is getting hard to find enough framers. I should have known better. I have a mortgage expert, Craig Brock, also from Southern California, call in toward the end of my show every day. He has been telling me for months that he can hardly keep up with the demand for his services. He also told me that his firm has to hold job fairs in order to fill their job openings. I am now convinced that this thing is for real, and I actually have had quite a bit of exposure in the accounts that I manage to this sector. Here are some ways that you can get into a sector that I believe has years of outperformance ahead. Let's begin with 401(k) investors. How can you take advantage of the rebound in the housing market? Every 401(k) plan varies in the choices that are offered. Some have just a few very broad choices, some have a myriad of mutual funds available to their participants, and some even allow investors to invest in individual stocks and exchange-traded funds. If you have a very narrow selection of funds, the best you can do is select the various growth funds (preferably small- and mid-cap) that are made available to you. You also may have a choice that is related to real estate in some way. If you have a myriad of funds offered to you, check out the ones that focus on the home-building and construction sectors.

OCN,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Ramping up sales of $1.2 trillion in mortgages owned by government-controlled housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will help taxpayers and benefit borrowers, say analysts and a Treasury Department official who spearheaded the initiative. At issue is a Treasury Department decision last month to cut the amount of mortgages sitting on Fannie and Freddie’s portfolios by 15% a year instead of the previous plan that pushed the firms to sell assets at 10% annually. The faster sales, announced in late August, a 50% increase if fulfilled, will result in the two firms reducing their portfolios to $250 billion each by 2018, four years earlier than scheduled. MacArthur Foundation Michael Stegman, counselor to the Secretary of the Treasury for Housing Finance Policy Michael Stegman, counselor to the Secretary of the Treasury for Housing Finance Policy, told MarketWatch the faster cuts to the Fannie FNMA, +7.80%   and Freddie FMCC, +8.14% portfolio are “very significant” because they reduce taxpayer, operational and financial risks of the two firms.   He added that accelerating the wind-down of the portfolio requires Fannie and Freddie to sell some of their delinquent assets. This move, he said, will get non-performing mortgages outside of the mainstream banks and into the hands of so called “special servicers” that have less accounts per representative, and more time and energy to focus on modifying mortgages or reaching a resolution that is “good for the family.” Fannie and Freddie have roughly 1.7 million delinquent loans on their portfolio as of May 2012, down from the 1.9 million delinquent loans the firms had on their books in the same period in 2011. Delinquent loans are mortgages where the borrower is more than 30 days behind on their loan payment. “What you are also doing is helping to de-risk Fannie and Freddie as a source of volatility and cut the risk located within these very large portfolios that built up over time,” Stegman said. Tim Rood, managing director of business-advisory firm Collingwood Group, said he agreed with Stegman that the move would help delinquent borrowers, adding that Fannie and Freddie are not equipped to deal with such an “order of magnitude” of seriously non-performing loans. Nationstar Mortgage NSM, -0.50%  and Ocwen Finanicial Corp. OCN, -1.58%  are two examples of special mortgage servicers, also known as “high-touch” servicers. ECONOMY AND POLITICS | @MKTWEconomics  AFP/Getty Images A city-by-city look at home prices in May Tampa, Charlotte among gainers. • U.S. homeownership at 18-year low  Separately, the largest four U.S. mortgage servicers are owned by Bank of America Corp. BAC, -3.87% Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -3.36%  , J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -3.16% and Citigroup Inc. C, -0.84% C, -0.84% Rood added that the expedited sales -- including delinquent mortgages -- will bring the firms closer to a position where legislators can complete real reform of Fannie and Freddie, a process that has stalled recently and won’t pick up until after the November elections. “You need to get to a place where you have eliminated the bulk of the portfolio as this policy is working towards,” Rood said. “They need to increase their capital and they need restrictions on adding to the portfolio but for exigent circumstances.” Donald Lamson, a former Office of the Comptroller of the Currency assistant director who now is counsel at Shearman & Sterling in Washington, argued that the hike in sales will cut the role Fannie and Freddie play in the marketplace, a positive step. However, he added that it is a difficult balance. “For optics purposes the government wants to reduce the role Fannie and Freddie play in the marketplace at the same time they want the two firms to be able to hold mortgages so lending to homeowners can continue,” he said. Lamson, who helped draft crisis reform legislation at the Treasury, said it is an interesting coincidence that Fannie and Freddie are expediting its wind-down of mortgage securities at roughly the same time that the Federal Reserve has ramped up its purchases of mortgage-backed securities at a pace of $40 billion per month until the labor market improves in an effort known as QE3. See: Story about Fed launching QE3 by buying mortgage securities Capital Economics said Tuesday that QE3 could eventually leave the Fed holding nearly 30% of all mortgage-backed securities, making it a bigger player in the market than either banks or mutual funds both of which also buy MBS. Foreign governments such as China also buy MBS. Rood said that the faster sales complement an effort by the regulator for Fannie and Freddie to attract investors seeking to transform foreclosed properties on the firms’ books into rehabilitated rental units. Fannie and Freddie can sell $250 million security without Treasury approval One of the provisions in the new structure for Fannie and Freddie is to allow the two firms to sell up to $250 million in assets in one lump sum without Treasury’s approval. Previously, they had to come to Treasury for sales that were “outside the normal course of business.” RELATED STORIES: REAL ESTATE • Builder earnings may hold hint about prices • New-home sales fade in December • Home prices post first monthly decline in a year • Only 2 professions own more homes post-recession • Money tips for home remodeling | Most popular remodeling projects Treasury’s Stegman said that the cut off allows them to operate as efficiently as possible. “We think that $250 million means that anything really significant still will require Treasury approval, but it will enable them to operate as efficiently as possible, and not to have to come to us with every sale,” Stegman said. Rood said that approach will also help taxpayers. He argued that bulk sales of more than $250 million have had bad executions and that Fannie and Freddie have found more success breaking the securities into mini-bundles and selling those. “Not having to get Treasury’s approval for these sales expedites the liquidation of the assets at a better return,” Rood said. Why keep $250 billion on the books? Stegman defended the Treasury’s plan to ultimately keep $250 billion each on their portfolios. He said that keeping some remaining portfolio of mortgages gives the two firms the flexibility to buy out defaulted loans -- foreclosed mortgages that were securitized, for example, and hold them as they modify them into re-performing loans. After they become performing loans, Stegman said, they can be re-packaged and sold. He added that a portfolio is also needed to manage hard-to-securitize multi-family assets such as apartment buildings.

OCN,"Home Loan Servicing Solutions Ltd. (HLSS) declined on Wednesday, its first day as a public company, even as broader markets continued to push higher. The company's stock opened at $13.25 a share on the Nasdaq, down 5% from its initial public offering price of $14; it was changing hands recently at $13.56, down 3.1%. It sold 13.3 million shares at the low end of its $14-to-$16 price range. Headquartered in the Cayman Islands, Home Loan Servicing was created to acquire mortgage-servicing rights and other income from servicing mortgage loans. By just acquiring the rights, the company will not originate or purchase mortgage loans; in fact, it won't even actually service the loans. It plans to hire another firm to do that. Home Loan Servicing has multiple ties to Ocwen Financial Corp. OCN, -1.21% It is using its IPO proceeds to purchase the right to receive servicing and other fees from Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC, a subsidiary of Ocwen, on a portion of its pooling and servicing agreements. Its executives were in senior management roles at Ocwen Financial up until the IPO, when they resigned from Ocwen to join Home Loan Servicing. The company plans to eventually purchase ""substantially all"" the remaining mortgage-servicing rights currently owned by Ocwen Loan Servicing. Ocwen Financial's stock was trading recently at $16.15, essentially flat. Home Loan says its business plan will result in predictable revenue and expenses, generating a stable income stream. It plans to distribute at least 90% of its net income to its shareholders via dividends. On Jan. 30, Home Loan's board declared a contingent interim dividend of 10 cents a share per month for each of the three full months following the IPO; on an annualized basis of $1.20, that results in a yield of 8.6% at the IPO price. The company's strategy is complicated by the transfer of legal ownership of mortgage-servicing rights from the seller, which requires the prior approval or consent of various third parties, including rating agencies. That's the case with its initial deal with Ocwen Loan Servicing, which doesn't have the necessary approvals and consents as of the IPO closing. Home Loan Servicing says that shouldn't affect its business strategy or performance; if a seller hasn't obtained the necessary approvals and consents, the company instead plans to acquire the rights to receive the servicing fees that the current servicer receives, as it has done with Ocwen's first batch. As compensation for its servicing work after Home Loan buys the rights, Ocwen Loan Servicing will receive a monthly base fee initially equal to 12% of servicing fees collected each month, with the opportunity to earn a monthly performance-based incentive fee. The mortgage-servicing assets that the new company will purchase are a portion of the assets acquired by Ocwen Loan Servicing when it purchased the U.S. subprime mortgage-servicing business of HomEq Servicing in Sept. 2010. The estimated price for the initial purchase is $181 million. The company says it obtained an opinion from the Mortgage Industry Advisory Corporation, an independent valuation firm, of the fairness of the purchase price. One of the risks Home Loan cites in its prospectus is its status as a new company; it has no track record of performance to show investors. It warns that its business model is untested and its operations don't begin until after the IPO and the initial acquisition from Ocwen. William C. Erbey, the chairman and founder of Home Loan Servicing, has agreed to purchase $10 million worth of the new company's shares at the IPO price in a concurrent private placement; he will also continue to serve as chairman at Ocwen. Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -3.22% Barclays PLC's (BCS) Barclays Capital, Citigroup Inc. C, -0.68% and Deutsche Bank AG DB, -3.18% managed Home Loan Servicing's offering.

OCN,"Reuters CHICAGO (MarketWatch) — This spotty economic recovery has fooled more than a few: bad days for bears, good days for champions of small-cap stocks, whose strong rebound just may continue. In that constant churn between “risk on” and “risk off,” investors have been getting a little more adventurous, and small caps are delivering. The Russell 2000 Index RUT, -2.68%  rose 7% last month, marking its best January since 2006. The Fed’s pledge of low interest rates certainly helps small-capitalization firms, which often have more trouble borrowing than their bigger rivals. Rex Nutting: A Long Employment Road to Go Most economists think the U.S. economy will chug along, with several looking for 2012 GDP growth of around 2% or a little better. That’s not bad for a base case, considering global pressures and timid executives and consumers still smarting from the financial crisis and recession. The small-cap story is playing out in earnings results. Four of every 10 small-cap companies are beating Wall Street expectations so far this year, and 54% have topped the sales estimate in recent reporting rounds, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. But have small-cap stocks come too far, too fast? “We are sticking with our [small-cap] return target of 11.5% for 2012 despite the strong gains to start the year, as the U.S. economy is expected to slow in the back half of the year but earnings expectations do not reflect this trend,” said Steven DeSanctis, head of U.S. small-cap strategy at B. of A. Merrill in a recent research report. “Volatility will rise thanks to Europe, the U.S. presidential election, new fiscal policies, and the Middle East,” he added. “This could put a damper on performance going forward.” TimeRussell 2000 IndexMay 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:RUT 1,400 1,500 1,600 Yet Jeffrey Schwartz, senior portfolio manager of the Pyxis Small-Cap Equity Fund HSZAX, -0.37% argued that the small caps is precisely where to position a portfolio for domestic economic growth because the space has less exposure to troubled international areas than both midcaps and large caps. Clearly there may be a few snags to the small-cap thread. That said, with the required caution also considered, here’s a short list of economic catalysts and market sectors where improved conditions should bode well for small-cap stocks: 1. Banking and credit There’s so much bad news priced into financial shares, “it sure wouldn’t take much to reignite fundamental improvement,” said Lawrence Creatura, manager of the Federated Clover Small Value Fund VSFAX, +1.10% “Expectations are subterranean. Nobody expects the environment to get much better here soon.” With pessimism about the economy still prevalent, Creatura is looking closely at smaller banks with a regional focus. “Pick your region, your management team, the type of lending you prefer, and track lending history,” Creatura said. “Small-cap financials have a huge advantage in this environment to the conglomerate banks.” For example, his fund includes Ocwen Financial Corp. OCN, -1.21% Still, banks have little interest-rate margin, no matter their size. Foreclosure backlogs are still unclogging. And Europe remains a risk to financial-system health, though more safeguards may be in place since 2008. 2. Home builders The trend is up in both housing construction and resale data. Starts jumped more than 9% in November and promptly fell a deeper-than-expected 4% in December. Industry surveys of residential builders are more optimistic. In late January, California-based builder Ryland Group Inc. RYL  reported a narrow profit after seven straight losing quarters. Its stock has doubled since October’s low. That should provide some inspiration for careful bargain hunting in the space, particularly those names yet unnoticed, according to analysts. Read more: Hope for home builders is bright, but for how long? That said, “For Sale” signs still dot many a cul-de-sac. Borrowing conditions are more favorable, but credit access and efficiency have been slowly catching up. Read more: Mortgage delinquencies, foreclosures decline. 3. Business investment In this case, technology investment is the key driver. Balance sheets are much improved and companies will have greater leverage as the economy gets better. Creatura said cloud computing and social networking are primary beneficiaries of business investment. When Will Apple Pay Dividends? “Companies have to reinvest in tech and infrastructure to keep up with the way the customer is researching and purchasing,” he said. He added that the recession weeded out tech firms that didn’t adapt, and those left standing are positioned to ride the economic upswing. Software multiples are at three times enterprise value/sales compared with one times EV/sales for hardware. The divergence shows the investment community believes hardware capital expenditures will climb, said Satya Pradhuman, director of research at Cirrus Research LLC. The semiconductor sector’s book-to-bill ratio looks to have bottomed at 0.71 and has risen in its last three monthly readings, standing now at 0.88. Yet valuations for semiconductor stocks, Pradhuman said, are at levels last seen late in 2004. Semiconductor makers “may be the poster child for high beta in this current market environment,” he added. “Mid- and small-cap semis have recovered a good portion of their 2011 loss but still have room to run.” Stocks his firm rates “most attractive” include Vishay Intertechnology Inc. VSH, -3.36% Veeco Instruments Inc. VECO, -4.71%  and Amkor Technology Inc. AMKR, -5.33% Also on the list: Entegris Inc. ENTG, -4.81%  and RF Micro Devices Inc. RFMD Read more: 5 money moves a small-cap stock pro is making now. 4. Retail sales and consumer discretionary spending For consumer-discretionary stocks, those focused on retailers in particular, it’s survival of the fittest. Nowadays, small-cap investors can pick from the premium crop, Federated’s Creatura said. During the recession, retailers worked down inventory and built up technology that better allows them to control in-demand inventory, plus spot and stock trends (including sizing) more efficiently. Consumer-sentiment gauges improved late in 2011 but paused to start the year. The trend here has been up. “Consumers are more upbeat about employment, but less optimistic about business conditions and their income prospects,” said Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center. Still, any sign of an economic stall, and investors are likely to scamper back into defensive consumer-staple stocks. 5. Hiring strength The best reading for job growth in nine months in January has some strong supporting data. The four-week moving average of jobless-benefits claims is near a four-year low. Some companies are lean to the point of skeletal, and, while many may get by with fewer workers, others need help to handle new orders. According to the Conference Board, consumers’ outlook for the labor market is moderately more favorable. Those expecting more jobs in the months ahead increased to 16.2% from 14%, while those anticipating fewer jobs has declined to 19.5% from 20.2%. Who’s hiring? According to Indeed.com, an employment website, health-care postings are up 42% on a year-over-year basis; hospitality listings are up 36%; manufacturing, up 22%; and construction-related jobs up 15%.

OCN,"TAKING THE PULSE: A confluence of concerns -- from European debt uncertainty to weak U.S. housing to questions about growth in Asia -- weighed on the markets in the second quarter, and as a consequence, on bank revenues from trading activities. For investment banks like Goldman Sachs GS, -2.76% which has derived more than half of its revenues from trading for the last few years, that weakness will likely lead to lower profits in the quarter, despite gains from investment banking because of a revival in deal activity. ""Trading activity levels continued to deteriorate, especially in the more complex and higher margin products"" in the quarter, said Sandler O'Neill + Partners analyst Jeff Harte in a note to clients, adding that fixed income currencies and commodities trading revenues are likely to be down roughly 25% to 30%, while equity trading revenues are projected more than 10% lower. COMPANIES TO WATCH: Goldman Sachs Group Inc. GS, -2.76% - reports July 19. Wall Street Expectations: Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect Goldman to post earnings of $2.38 a share. Expected revenues of $8.1 billion would be down 3% from last year's second quarter. The consensus does not include the $264 million cash sale of Litton Loan Servicing to Ocwen Financial Corp. OCN, -1.09% in June. Last year Goldman reported profits of 78 cents a share on revenue of $8.8 billion. Excluding a $550 million fine paid to the Securities and Exchange Commission and a U.K. payroll tax, last year's second quarter per-share profits would have been $2.75. Key Issues: Second quarter results in equity and FICC trading are expected to decline. But Goldman might have another issue: a 7% decline in June in its stake of Industrial & Commercial Bank of China, its biggest investment holding. That may result in a $224 million mark-to-market loss for the quarter, according to an estimate by Sandler O'Neill + Partners. Morgan Stanley MS, -3.04% -- reports July 21. Wall Street Expectations: Analysts expect Morgan Stanley to post a loss of 61 cents a share on revenue of $8 billion. The expected quarterly loss is due to a $1.7 billion charge from the restructuring of Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc.'s (8306.TO) investment in Morgan Stanley, which closed during the quarter. A year ago, the investment bank reported earnings of $1.09 a share, including discontinued operations, on revenue of $8 billion. Key Issues: The second quarter will be somewhat noisy for Morgan Stanley, which closed the conversion of Mitsubishi's ownership from preferred shares to common shares a quarter earlier than it had originally expected. The deal, which should result in a charge of roughly $1.00 a share, saved Morgan Stanley from having to make $800 million in annual dividend payments. Plunging trading volumes should continue to weigh on Chief Executive James Gorman's efforts to revive Morgan Stanley's underperforming trading business. On the investment banking front, Morgan Stanley took the lead role in many of the Street's hottest technology initial public offerings, though fees from those deals won't be booked until they close. Declining debt underwriting levels should offset higher equity underwriting activity during the quarter. Morgan Stanley will have a difficult time boosting the pre-tax profit margin in its wealth management business, a key goal for its brokerage joint venture. The firm needs to double its 10% margin to reach its 20% goal. (The Thomson Reuters and year-earlier figures may not be comparable due to one-time items and other adjustments.)

OCN,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — The Obama administration on Thursday halted payments to three of the largest U.S. banks until they make “substantial” improvements to their performance in a mortgage assistance program. ECONOMY AND POLITICS | @MKTWEconomics  AFP/Getty Images A city-by-city look at home prices in May Tampa, Charlotte among gainers. • U.S. homeownership at 18-year low  J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM Bank of America Corp. BAC and Wells Fargo & Co. WFC  can no longer receive fees from the program known as the Making Home Affordable Program, until they make changes to ensure their processes work better, the Treasury Department announced. The program seeks to help troubled borrowers avoid foreclosure. The big banks have been broadly criticized for foreclosure documentation errors, and in many cases, institutions have assigned only a single employee to rapidly approve numerous foreclosures. The major banks were sanctioned in April by federal regulators for “negligence” in residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure processes. Hefty fines in the billions of dollars are likely still on the way from a related, ongoing investigation on the part of state attorneys general and the Justice Department. The Treasury Department found that the three firms are in need of substantial improvements based on the agency’s compliance reviews and program performance results from the first quarter of 2011. They agency evaluated banks on how they contacted homeowners, evaluated whether homeowners need assistance and their management and governance. Banks have treated borrowers poorly, in part, by forcing them to repeatedly submit paperwork over and over and leaving them in limbo for months while they struggled to make payments, said Rev. Lucy Kolin, a spokeswoman at the PICO National Network, a group of faith-based community organizations. In many cases, the institutions ultimately deny “hundreds of thousands” of troubled borrowers a chance to avoid foreclosure, Kolin said. Wells Fargo spokeswoman Theresa Schrettenbrunner took issue with the Treasury report, noting that one of the calculations, on whether the lender correctly determined eligibility, uses data from the fourth quarter of 2010 and that Wells Fargo internal calculations show that the bank is performing much better lately. J.P. Morgan spokesman Patrick Linehan made a similar point. “The bank respectfully disagrees with the assessment,” he said in a statement. “We have made significant improvements since the modifications that Treasury reviewed and continue to work hard to keep improving our processes and controls.” Bank of America said in a statement that it acknowledges improvements must be made in key areas, particularly those affecting the customer experience. “We have made great progress in several key performance areas,” they added. Acting Assistant Secretary Timothy Massad said he wasn’t going to talk about any particular bank and the problems they may have with the report. He added that the Treasury Department will discuss any objections with each bank individually. He pointed out that the payment withholding decision is based on testing and sampling conducted in the fourth quarter of 2010 and first quarter of 2011. “If the servicer has fixed a problem in a reasonable time, then we will go back and resume payments,” Massad told reporters. He added that lenders who fix problems appropriately can still be eligible down the road to obtain payments that were halted based on this assessment. According to a Treasury spokeswoman, the three banks received $24 million in taxpayer-funded payments in May from the program. So far, the Treasury has spent just less than $2 billion of $50 billion in taxpayer funds allotted to the programs. In addition to the three big banks, another servicer, Ocwen Loan Servicing LLC OCN  , was also found as having substantial improvements but the agency decided not to withhold payments from the program because, the Treasury said, their problems were caused in part by a large servicing portfolio the company acquired recently. The Treasury results are part of an assessment it did on the ten largest mortgage servicers participating in the program. The Treasury said the other six servicers reviewed, including Citigroup Inc.’s C   CitiMortgage Inc., need moderate improvement and they are not having their taxpayer-funded payments stopped. The Making Home Affordable Program includes five subsidiary programs, the largest of which is the embattled Home Affordable Modification Program, which is uses government funds to modify mortgages so troubled borrowers can avoid foreclosure. As part of the HAMP program, mortgage servicers receive an up-front payment of $1,000 for each successful modification after completion of the trial-period, and “pay for success” fees of up to $1,000 per year for three years, as long as the borrower remains current. The other programs are smaller and include the Second Lien Modification Program, the Unemployment Program, Principal Reduction Alternative and the Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program. The penalties come after the Treasury last month required all lenders agreeing to modify mortgages using HAMP to provide a single point of contact to borrowers for loans not backed by housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.","June 9, 2011 2:01 p.m. ET",1,U.S. halts mortgage fees to three big banks,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-fees-to-three-big-banks-are-stopped-2011-06-09

Late last week, the Securities and Exchange Commission ordered a ban on short selling in shares of 799 U.S. financial institutions until Oct. 2. Short sales -- in which investors take a position in a stock in the belief that the stock's price will go down -- will continue to be prohibited in listings covered by the SEC's prior order. However, the SEC that said difficulties with classifications led to an incomplete list and that it's now up to exchanges to publish changes. ""We believe that these amendments are necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors to maintain fair and orderly securities markets, and to prevent substantial disruption to securities markets,"" according to a statement from the SEC.

Forward-looking statements by their nature address matters that are, to different degrees, uncertain. Our business has been undergoing substantial change, which has magnified such risks and uncertainties. You should bear these factors in mind when considering forward-looking statements and should not place undue reliance on such statements. Forward-looking statements involve a number of assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by such statements. In the past, actual results have differed from those suggested by forward-looking statements and this may happen again.

The new servicing system includes loan boarding, payment processing, escrow administration, and default management, among other functions. We also plan to use certain ancillary services offered by Black Knight. We believe this investment will improve the way we work, help simplify internal processes, and allow our teams to provide better service to our servicing customers and clients. However, implementing a large-scale transition to a new technology product such as a new servicing system is inherently complex and involves significant operational risk. We expect to devote significant capital and human resources to implementing this transition. If our transition to MSP does not go as planned, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.

OCN,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Feb 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Combined company to service 1.9 million loans on a pro forma basis as of December 31, 2017 Accelerates Ocwen's transition to an industry-leading servicing platform Expected to achieve meaningful operational and corporate overhead cost synergies Continue to be an industry leader in helping borrowers and improving loan portfolio performance through innovative loss mitigation programs Ocwen Financial Corporation OCN, -1.46% (""Ocwen"" or the ""Company""), a leading financial services holding company, today announced a definitive agreement under which Ocwen will acquire all of the outstanding shares of PHH Corporation PHH, +0.33% (""PHH""), a mortgage platform with established servicing and origination recapture capabilities, for approximately $360 million in cash or $11 per diluted common share. The purchase price represents a 35 percent discount to PHH's GAAP book equity at December 31, 2017. On a combined basis, as of December 31, 2017, the company would service 1.9 million loans with an unpaid principal balance of $328 billion and originate over $3 billion of residential mortgage loans, including reverse mortgages, annually. Ocwen projects that the increased size and scale of the combined company should create various strategic and financial benefits, including: Accelerating Ocwen's transition to an industry-leading servicing platform, Improving servicing and origination margins through improved economies of scale, Reducing fixed costs (on a combined basis) by eliminating redundant corporate overhead and public company-related costs, and Providing a superior foundation to eventually enable the combined servicing platform to resume new business and growth activities to offset portfolio runoff. It is anticipated that at closing, which is expected to occur during the second half of 2018 following various required approvals, there will be sufficient available cash on PHH's balance sheet to enable $260 million of the $360 million purchase price to be funded out of PHH's available cash, while providing for sufficient additional liquidity to fund its operations going forward. Ocwen will also assume $119 million of PHH's outstanding corporate debt. Ron Faris, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ocwen, stated, ""We are very pleased to announce the proposed acquisition of PHH, a leading non-bank servicer. PHH is a high-quality servicer with complementary capabilities and business lines to Ocwen, making it a great strategic match for us. In addition to providing significant scale benefits, this transaction gives us the opportunity to migrate to their existing BlackKnight LoanSphere MSP(R) servicing platform more quickly and with less risk than had we just implemented the system ourselves. We are also excited by the opportunity to welcome the PHH employees to the Ocwen family and by the opportunity to bring our industry-leading and innovative loss mitigation capabilities to existing PHH servicing customers currently struggling with their mortgage payments."" Robert B. Crowl, President and Chief Executive Officer of PHH, said, ""We are pleased to have reached an agreement with Ocwen, and we look forward to working with them to bring this transaction to a successful close. We are excited by the opportunity to build a stronger combined company for our servicing and subservicing clients, our borrowers, and our employees."" The acquisition is subject to various closing conditions, including PHH shareholder approval and regulatory and other approvals, and is targeted to close in the second half of 2018. Barclays is serving as lead financial advisor to Ocwen and Sullivan and Cromwell LLP is serving as its legal counsel.

OCN,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla., Nov 02, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Reported a Q3 2017 net loss of $(6) million, a $38 million improvement over Q2 2017 Servicing segment recorded a pre-tax profit for fifth consecutive quarter Generated $120 million of Cash Flows from Operating Activities during Q3 2017 Continued focus on helping homeowners, including those recently impacted by hurricanes Ocwen Financial Corporation OCN, -0.36% (""Ocwen"" or the ""Company""), a leading financial services holding company, today announced operating results for the third quarter of 2017. Ocwen incurred a GAAP net loss of $(6.1) million, or $(0.05) per share, for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to net income of $9.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Ocwen generated revenue of $284.6 million, down 20.8% compared to the third quarter of the prior year, primarily driven by the impact of portfolio run-off and lower HAMP fees due to the expiration of the program. Cash Flows from Operating Activities were $120.5 million for the third quarter and $401.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to $178.3 million for the third quarter of last year and $350.4 million for the first nine months of last year. ""We continued to make progress during the third quarter on a number of fronts. We transferred the first tranche of mortgage servicing rights under our July agreements with New Residential Investment Corp., and we made progress settling some of our regulatory matters,"" commented Ron Faris, President and CEO of Ocwen. Mr. Faris continued, ""Our servicing business continues to perform well despite portfolio runoff and achieved its fifth consecutive quarterly pre-tax profit. We continue to focus on helping homeowners in need, including those recently impacted by the hurricanes through a variety of targeted programs. I would also note that our own offices, especially those in the United States Virgin Islands, sustained substantial damage, but we have been able to maintain operations with only minimal interruption."" Third Quarter 2017 Results Pre-tax loss for the third quarter of 2017 was $(26.6) million, a $(28.9) million decline from the third quarter of 2016. Net loss for the third quarter results for 2017 included a one-time tax benefit of $23.2 million related to the release of certain previously established reserves relating to uncertain tax positions. The Servicing segment recorded $5.7 million of pre-tax income, a $(29.8) million decline versus the third quarter of 2016, driven by $(25.8) million lower HAMP fees. Revenue loss from runoff was offset by operational and financing cost improvements across multiple areas. On September 1, 2017, we transferred legal title for MSRs with $15.9 billion in UPB to NRZ and received a lump sum payment of $54.6 million. Conceptually, these upfront payments are a proxy for the net present value of the difference between higher future fees for servicing the mortgage loans under the relevant 2012 and 2013 agreements and the lower fees for servicing the mortgage loans under the new subservicing arrangements. The Lending segment recorded $(7.6) million of pre-tax loss for the third quarter of 2017, an $(8.9) million decline versus the third quarter of 2016. Pre-tax results for the quarter included a $(6.8) million write-off of the carrying value of internally-developed software used in our forward lending wholesale channel. Total mortgage lending volume declined by 46% over the third quarter of 2016, driven by our decision to exit the forward lending correspondent channel in the second quarter of 2017 and a 55% reduction in the forward lending wholesale channel over the third quarter of 2016. The correspondent and wholesale volume declines were partially offset by a 102% increase in funded volumes at our higher margin forward lending retail channel and 7% overall growth in reverse lending versus the third quarter of 2016. Additional Third Quarter 2017 Business Highlights Completed 6,544 modifications in the quarter, 9% of which were HAMP modifications. Note that the HAMP program ended on December 31, 2016, but modifications in process at that time continue to close. Delinquencies decreased from 11.2% at December 31, 2016 to 9.4% at September 30, 2017, primarily driven by loss mitigation efforts. The constant pre-payment rate (CPR) decreased from 15.0% in the second quarter of 2017 to 14.7% in the third quarter of 2017. In the third quarter of 2017, prime CPR was 18.0%, and non-prime CPR was 12.7%. In the third quarter of 2017, Ocwen originated forward and reverse mortgage loans with unpaid principal balance of $541.2 million and $227.8 million, respectively. Our reverse mortgage portfolio ended the quarter with an estimated $98.7 million in undiscounted future gains from forecasted future draws on existing loans. Neither the anticipated future gains nor the future funding liability are included in the Company's financial statements. Webcast and Conference Call Ocwen will host a webcast and conference call on Thursday, November 2, 2017, at 8:30 a.m., Eastern Time, to discuss its financial results for the third quarter of 2017.
