ACRS,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included later in this Annual Report. In addition to historical financial information, the following discussion contains forward�looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, beliefs and expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward�looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report, particularly in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" and ""Special Note Regarding Forward�Looking Statements."" Overview We are a dermatologist-led biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing innovative and differentiated therapies to address significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology. Our lead product ESKATA (hydrogen peroxide) topical solution, 40% (w/w), or ESKATA, is a proprietary formulation of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide topical solution that has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, as a prescription treatment for raised seborrheic keratosis, or SK, a common non-malignant skin tumor. The FDA approved our New Drug Application, or NDA, for ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs in December 2017. We also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, for ESKATA in the European Union in July 2017. We are also developing another high-concentration formulation of hydrogen peroxide, A-101 45% Topical Solution, as a prescription treatment for common warts, also known as verruca vulgaris. Additionally, in 2015, we in-licensed exclusive, worldwide rights to certain inhibitors of the Janus kinase, or JAK, family of enzymes, for specified dermatological conditions, including alopecia areata, or AA, vitiligo and androgenetic alopecia, or AGA, also known as male or female pattern baldness. In 2016, we acquired additional intellectual property rights for the development and commercialization of certain JAK inhibitors for specified dermatological conditions. We intend to continue to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates and technologies to build a fully integrated dermatology company. In August 2017, we acquired Confluence Life Sciences, Inc. or Confluence. The acquisition of Confluence adds small molecule drug discovery and preclinical development capabilities which has allowed us to bring early-stage research and development activities in-house that we previously outsourced to third parties. Through the acquisition of Confluence, we also acquired several preclinical product candidates, including inhibitors of the MK-2 signaling pathway, additional JAK inhibitors known as ""soft"" JAK inhibitors, and inhibitors of interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase, or ITK. Since our inception in July 2012, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain and engaging in other discovery and clinical activities in dermatology. We have financed our operations with sales of our convertible preferred stock, as well as net proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO, in October 2015, a private placement of our common stock in June 2016, public offerings of our common stock in November 2016 and August 2017, and an at-the-market facility with Cowen and Company LLC, or Cowen, that we entered into in November 2016. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 and $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $159.4 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution over the next several years as we begin to commercialize ESKATA. In addition, ESKATA and our other drug candidates, if approved, may not achieve commercial success. Though ESKATA has been approved by the FDA, we do not expect to generate substantial revenue from sales of ESKATA in the near term, if at all. We also expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our other drug candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our other drug candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. We may also incur expenses in connection with the in-license or acquisition of additional drug candidates. Furthermore, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with operating as a public company, including legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements Table of Contents or arrangements when needed on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions. License Agreement with Rigel In August 2015, we entered into an exclusive, worldwide license and collaboration agreement with Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Rigel, for the development and commercialization of products containing two specified JAK inhibitors. Under this agreement, we intend to develop these JAK inhibitors for the treatment of alopecia areata, or AA, and potentially for other dermatological conditions. We paid Rigel an upfront nonrefundable payment of $8.0 million in September 2015. In addition, we have agreed to make aggregate payments of up to $80.0 million upon the achievement of specified pre-commercialization milestones, such as clinical trials and regulatory approvals. Further, we have agreed to pay up to an additional $10.0 million to Rigel upon the achievement of a second set of development milestones. With respect to any products we commercialize under the agreement, we will pay Rigel quarterly tiered royalties on our annual net sales of each product at a high single digit percentage of annual net sales, subject to specified reductions until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis or, in specified countries under specified circumstances, 10 years from the first commercial sale of such product. The agreement terminates on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations unless earlier terminated by either party for a material breach. We may also terminate the agreement without cause at any time upon advance written notice to Rigel. Rigel, after consultation with us, will be responsible for maintaining and prosecuting the patent rights, and we will have final decision-making authority regarding such patent rights for a product in the United States and the European Union. To the extent that we jointly develop intellectual property, we will confer and decide which party will be responsible for filing, prosecuting and maintaining those patent rights. The agreement also establishes a joint steering committee composed of an equal number of representatives for each party, which will monitor progress in the development of products. We accounted for the license and collaboration agreement with Rigel as an asset acquisition since the arrangement did not meet the definition of a business pursuant to the guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations. Accordingly, we recorded the $8.0 million upfront payment as research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2015. We will record contingent milestone payments and royalties as research and development expense or cost of revenues, respectively, in the period in which such liabilities are incurred. We concluded the licensing arrangement with Rigel did not meet the definition of a business because the transaction principally resulted in its acquisition of intellectual property. As part of the transaction, we did not acquire employees, tangible assets, processes, protocols or operating systems. In addition, at the time of the acquisition, there were no activities being conducted related to the licensed patents. We expensed the acquired intellectual property asset upon acquisition because we will use it in our research and development activities and believe it has no alternative future uses. Table of Contents Stock Purchase Agreement with Vixen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and License Agreement with Columbia University In March 2016, we entered into a stock purchase agreement with Vixen Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Vixen, and JAK1, LLC, JAK2, LLC and JAK3, LLC, all together with Vixen, the Selling Stockholders, and Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company, solely in its capacity as the representative of the Selling Stockholders. Pursuant to the Vixen Agreement, we acquired all shares of Vixen's capital stock from the Selling Stockholders, or the Vixen Acquisition. Following the Vixen Acquisition, Vixen became a wholly-owned subsidiary of us. Pursuant to the Vixen Agreement, we paid $0.6 million upfront and issued an aggregate of 159,420 shares of our common stock to the Selling Stockholders. We are obligated to make annual payments of $0.1 million on March 24th of each year, through March 2022, with such amounts being creditable against specified future payments that may be paid under the Vixen Agreement. We are obligated to make aggregate payments of up to $18.0 million to the Selling Stockholders upon the achievement of specified pre-commercialization milestones for three products in the United States, the European Union and Japan, and aggregate payments of up to $22.5 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. With respect to any commercialized products covered by the Vixen Agreement, we are obligated to pay low single-digit royalties on net sales, subject to specified reductions, limitations and other adjustments, until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis or, in specified circumstances, ten years from the first commercial sale of such product. If we sublicense any of Vixen's patent rights and know-how acquired pursuant to the Vixen Agreement, we will be obligated to pay a portion of any consideration we receive from such sublicenses in specified circumstances. As a result of the transaction with Vixen, we became party to the Exclusive License Agreement, by and between Vixen and the Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York, or Columbia, dated as of December 31, 2015, or the License Agreement. Under the License Agreement, we are obligated to pay Columbia an annual license fee of $10,000 subject to specified adjustments for patent expenses incurred by Columbia and creditable against any royalties that may be paid under the License Agreement. We are also obligated to pay up to an aggregate of $11.6 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones, including specified levels of net sales of products covered by Columbia patent rights and/or know-how, and royalties at a sub-single-digit percentage of annual net sales of products covered by Columbia patent rights and/or know-how, subject to specified adjustments. If we sublicense any of Columbia's patent rights and know-how acquired pursuant to the License Agreement, we will be obligated to pay Columbia a portion of any consideration received from such sublicenses in specified circumstances. The royalties, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis, are payable until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, the expiration of any market exclusivity period granted by a regulatory body or, in specified circumstances, ten years from the first commercial sale of such product. The License Agreement terminates on the date of expiration of all royalty obligations thereunder unless earlier terminated by either party for a material breach, subject to a specified cure period. We may also terminate the License Agreement without cause at any time upon advance written notice to Columbia. We accounted for the transaction with Vixen as an asset acquisition as the arrangement did not meet the definition of a business pursuant to the guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 805, Business Combinations. We concluded the transaction with Vixen did not meet the definition of a business because the transaction principally resulted in the acquisition of the License Agreement. We did not acquire tangible assets, processes, protocols or operating systems. In addition, at the time of the transaction, there were no activities being conducted related to the licensed patents. We expensed the acquired intellectual property as of the acquisition date on the basis that the cost of intangible assets purchased from others for use in research and development activities, and that have no alternative future uses, are expensed at the time the costs are incurred. Accordingly, we recorded the $0.6 million upfront payment, the fair value of the shares of common stock issued of $2.4 million, and the present value of the six non-contingent annual payments as research and development expense in the year ended December 31, 2016. Additionally, we will record as expense any contingent milestone payments or royalties in the period in which such liabilities are incurred. Table of Contents Agreement and Plan of Merger with Confluence In August 2017, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Confluence, Aclaris Life Sciences, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary, or Merger Sub, and Fortis Advisors LLC, as representative of the holders of Confluence equity, or the Agreement and Plan of Merger. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, the Merger Sub merged with and into Confluence, with Confluence surviving as our wholly-owned subsidiary. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, we paid $10.3 million in cash and issued 349,527 shares of our common stock with a value of $9.7 million. We also agreed to pay the Confluence equity holders aggregate contingent consideration of up to $80.0 million, based upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones set forth in the Agreement and Plan of Merger. Of the contingent consideration, $2.5 million may be paid in shares of our common stock upon the achievement of a specified development milestone. In addition, we have agreed to pay the Confluence equity holders specified future royalty payments calculated as a low single-digit percentage of annual net sales, subject to specified reductions, limitations and other adjustments, until the date that all of the patent rights for that product have expired, as determined on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis or, in specified circumstances, ten years from the first commercial sale of such product. In addition, if we sell, license or transfer any of the intellectual property acquired from Confluence pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger to a third party, we will be obligated to pay the Confluence equity holders a portion of any incremental consideration (in excess of the development and milestone payments described above) that we receive from such sale, license or transfer in specified circumstances. Other Third-Party Agreements Under an assignment agreement, pursuant to which we acquired intellectual property, we have agreed to pay royalties on sales of ESKATA, or other related products, at rates ranging in low single-digit percentages of net sales, as defined in the agreement. Under this assignment agreement, we have paid aggregate milestone payments of $0.2 million and there are no remaining milestone payment obligations. In connection with the assignment agreement, we also entered into a finder's services agreement under which we have paid aggregate milestone payments of $1.5 million upon the achievement of specified pre-commercialization milestones, such as clinical trials and regulatory approvals, as described in the agreement. We have also agreed to make aggregate payments of up to $4.5 million upon the achievement of specified commercial milestones. In addition, we have agreed to pay royalties on sales of ESKATA, or other related products, at a low single-digit percentage of net sales, as defined in the agreement. Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue We earn revenue from the provision of laboratory services to clients through Confluence, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Laboratory service revenue is generally evidenced by contracts with clients which are on an agreed upon fixed-price, fee-for-service basis and are generally billed on a monthly basis in arrears for services rendered. Revenue related to these contracts is generally recognized as the laboratory services are performed, based upon the rates specified in the contracts. We also receive revenue from grants under the Small Business Innovation Research program of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. Through our Confluence subsidiary, we currently have two active grants from NIH which are related to early-stage research. We recognize revenue related to these grants as amounts become reimbursable under each grant, which is generally when research is performed, and the related costs are incurred. Our contract research segment has earned all of our revenue to date. We have never received revenue in our dermatology therapeutics segment. Table of Contents Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of costs incurred in connection with the provision of laboratory services to our clients through Confluence. Cost of revenue primarily includes: � employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; � outsourced professional scientific services; � depreciation of laboratory equipment; � facility-related costs; and � laboratory materials and supplies used to support the services provided. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our drug candidates. We expense research and development costs as incurred. These expenses include: � expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies; � manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials and commercial materials, including manufacturing validation batches; � outsourced professional scientific development services; � employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; � depreciation of manufacturing equipment; � payments made under agreements with third parties under which we have acquired or licensed intellectual property; � expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; and � laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Our direct research and development expenses primarily consist of external costs including fees paid to CROs, consultants, investigator sites, regulatory agencies and third parties that manufacture our preclinical and clinical trial materials, and are tracked on a program-by-program basis. We do not allocate personnel costs, facilities or other indirect expenses, which are included within ""Personnel and other costs"" in the table below, to specific research and development programs. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods presented:  Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 2015 ESKATA and A-101 45% Topical Solution $ 10,712 $ 15,357 $ 4,578 JAK inhibitors 11,789 7,314 29 Vixen acquisition - 3,435 - Rigel up-front payment - - 8,253 Other research expenses 1,253 190 201 Total project-related expenses 23,754 26,296 13,061 Personnel and other costs 10,565 4,889 2,021 Stock-based compensation 5,471 2,291 257 Total research and development expenses $ 39,790 $ 33,476 $ 15,339  Research and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, continue to conduct clinical trials of A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts, and conduct preclinical and clinical development activities and prepare regulatory filings for our other drug candidates. Table of Contents The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our drug candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including: � the number of clinical sites included in the trials; � the length of time required to enroll suitable patients; � the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials; � the number of doses patients receive; � the duration of patient follow-up; and � the results of our clinical trials. Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of marketing approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our drug candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Drug commercialization will take several years and millions of dollars in development costs. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, administrative, finance and legal functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, patent filing and prosecution costs, professional fees for marketing, legal, auditing and tax services, insurance costs, as well as payments made under our related party services agreement and milestone payments under our finder's services agreement. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with Nasdaq and SEC requirements, accounting and investor relations costs, and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company. Additionally, we anticipate a significant increase in payroll, marketing, sales and other expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations related to the launch of ESKATA. Interest Income Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States. The preparation of our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of expenses during the reported period. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. We evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. While our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in the notes to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we believe that the following accounting policies are those most critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, which under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Topic No. 13, ""Revenue Recognition,"" is when revenue is realized or realizable and earned, there is persuasive evidence a revenue arrangement exists, delivery of goods or services has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. . . .

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain statements contained in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. The words or phrases ""would be,"" ""will allow,"" ""intends to,"" ""will likely result,"" ""are expected to,"" ""will continue,"" ""is anticipated,"" ""estimate,"" ""project,"" or similar expressions, or the negative of such words or phrases, are intended to identify ""forward-looking statements."" We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and projections about future events. Because such statements include risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including risks related to: � our estimates regarding expenses, future revenues, capital requirements and needs for additional financing; � the success and timing of our preclinical studies and clinical trials and regulatory approval of protocols for future clinical trials; � the difficulties in obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our drug candidates, and the labeling under any approval we may obtain; � our plans and ability to develop, manufacture and commercialize our drug candidates; � the expected benefits of our acquisition of Confluence Life Sciences, Inc.; � our ability to recruit or retain key scientific or management personnel or to retain our executive officers; � the size and growth of the potential markets for our drug candidates and our ability to serve those markets; � regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries; � the rate and degree of market acceptance of any of our drug candidates; � our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates and our proprietary technology; � the successful development of our commercialization capabilities, including sales and marketing capabilities; � the impact of recently enacted and future legislation and regulation regarding the healthcare system; � the success of competing therapies and products that are or become available; and � the performance of third parties, including contract research organizations and third-party manufacturers. These and other factors that could cause or contribute to these differences are described in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q in Part II - Item 1A, ""Risk Factors,"" and under similar captions in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Statements made herein are as of the date of the filing of this Form 10-Q with the Table of Contents Securities and Exchange Commission and should not be relied upon as of any subsequent date. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, we do not undertake, and we specifically disclaim, any obligation to update any forward-looking statements to reflect occurrences, developments, unanticipated events or circumstances after the date of such statement. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 15, 2017. Overview We are a dermatologist-led biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing innovative and differentiated therapies to address significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology. Our lead drug candidate, A-101 40% Topical Solution, is a proprietary formulation of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide topical solution that we are developing as a prescription treatment for seborrheic keratosis, or SK, a common non-malignant skin tumor. In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated two multi-center, randomized, double blinded, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials and one open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of A-101 40% Topical Solution in patients with SK. In November 2016, we announced positive top-line results from the two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, which are summarized below. Based on these results, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, for A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of SK to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in February 2017, and the NDA was accepted for filing by the FDA in May 2017. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of the NDA is December 24, 2017. We also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the European Union in July 2017. We are also developing A-101 45% Topical Solution as a prescription treatment for common warts, also known as verruca vulgaris. Additionally, in 2015, we in-licensed exclusive, worldwide rights to certain inhibitors of the Janus kinase, or JAK, family of enzymes, for specified dermatological conditions, including alopecia areata, or AA, vitiligo and androgenetic alopecia, or AGA. In 2016, we acquired additional intellectual property rights for the development and commercialization of certain JAK inhibitors for specified dermatological conditions. We intend to continue to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates and technologies to build a fully integrated dermatology company. In November 2016, we completed two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of A-101 40% Topical Solution in a combined 937 patients who each had a total of four target SK lesions located on the face, trunk and extremities. Each trial met all primary and secondary endpoints for that trial, achieving clinically and statistically significant clearance of SK lesions. Additionally, we completed an open-label safety trial of A-101 40% Topical Solution in November 2016, in which we enrolled 147 patients. Across all three clinical trials, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events among patients treated with A-101 40% Topical Solution, and the most common adverse events reported were nasopharyngitis and sinusitis which were determined to be unrelated to A-101 40% Topical Solution. Based on these results, we submitted an NDA for A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of SK to the FDA in February 2017, and the NDA was accepted by the FDA in May 2017. We also submitted an MAA in the European Union in July 2017. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of the NDA is December 24, 2017. If approved, A-101 40% Topical Solution would become the first FDA-approved medication for the treatment of SK. Table of Contents We are also developing A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts. Although common warts are generally not harmful and in most cases eventually clear without medical treatment, they may be painful and aesthetically unattractive and are contagious. On an annual basis, 1.9 million people are diagnosed with common warts. Common warts can be removed with slow-acting, over-the-counter products containing salicylic acid. As with SK, cryosurgery is the most frequently used in-office treatment for common warts. No prescription drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of common warts. We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in August 2016 evaluating 40% and 45% concentrations of A-101 for the treatment of common warts. In this Phase 2 clinical trial, in which 90 patients completed an eight-week treatment period, we observed statistically significant improvements in the mean change in the Physician's Wart Assessment, or PWA, score and in complete clearance of common warts in patients treated with the 45% concentration of A-101 compared to placebo. In June 2017, we commenced two additional Phase 2 clinical trials of A-101 45% Topical Solution to assess the dose frequency in adult and pediatric patients with common warts. We have completed enrollment in these trials, with a total of 316 patients enrolled at 34 investigational centers in the United States. We expect to report data from these additional Phase 2 clinical trials in the first half of 2018. In addition, we are developing the JAK inhibitors, ATI-50001 and ATI-50002, which we in-licensed from Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Rigel, as potential treatments for AA. AA is an autoimmune dermatologic condition typically characterized by patchy non-scarring hair loss on the scalp and body. More severe forms of AA include total scalp hair loss, known as alopecia totalis, and total hair loss on the scalp and body, known as alopecia universalis. AA affects up to 2.0% of people globally at some point during their lifetime (i.e. incidence) and up to 0.2% of people are affected at any given time (i.e. prevalence) - with two-thirds of affected individuals being 30 years old or younger at the time of disease onset. Treatment options for the less severe, patchy forms of AA include corticosteroids, either topically applied or injected directly into the scalp where the bare patches are located, or the induction of an allergic reaction at the site of hair loss using a topical contact sensitizing agent, an approach known as topical immunotherapy. The same treatment options are utilized for the more severe forms of AA, although utilization of these treatment options for the more severe forms of AA is limited due to limited efficacy, certain side effects, and their impracticality for extensive surface areas. We are developing ATI-50001 as an oral treatment for AA and ATI-50002 as a topical treatment for AA and vitiligo, a disorder in which white patches of skin appear on different parts of the body. We submitted an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to the FDA for ATI-50001 in October 2016, and we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of this drug candidate in the first quarter of 2017. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 dose-ranging clinical trial of ATI-50001 for the treatment of AA in the first half of 2018. We submitted an IND to the FDA for ATI-50002 for the treatment of AA in July 2017. We have initiated two Phase 2 clinical trials of ATI-50002 for the treatment of AA in which we expect to enroll a total of up to 36 patients, with data expected to be available in the first half of 2018. We expect to initiate one additional Phase 2 dose-ranging clinical trial of ATI-50002 for the treatment of AA in November 2017 in which we plan to enroll approximately 120 patients at 20 investigational centers in the United States. We expect data for this additional Phase 2 clinical trial to be available in the second half of 2018. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial of ATI-50002 for the treatment of vitiligo by the end of 2017. We are also developing another series of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of AGA. In August 2017, we acquired Confluence Life Sciences, Inc. or Confluence. The acquisition of Confluence adds small molecule drug discovery and preclinical development capabilities which, we expect, will allow us to bring early-stage research and development activities in-house that we currently outsource to third parties. Through the acquisition of Confluence, we also acquired several preclinical product candidates, including additional JAK inhibitors known as ""soft"" JAK inhibitors, as well as inhibitors of the MK-2 signaling pathway and inhibitors of interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase, or ITK. We paid $10.3 million in cash and issued 349,527 shares of our common stock with a value of $9.7 million, to the former equity holders of Confluence. We are obligated to pay up to $80.0 million to the former Confluence equityholders upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as low single-digit royalties upon net sales of covered products and a portion of any amounts we may receive from the further sale, out-license or transfer of the acquired intellectual property to third parties. Table of Contents Since our inception in July 2012, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of SK, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain and engaging in other discovery and clinical activities in dermatology. Through the date of this report, we have financed our operations with sales of our convertible preferred stock, as well as net proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO, in October 2015, a private placement of our common stock in June 2016, public offerings of our common stock in November 2016 and August 2017, and an at-the-market facility with Cowen and Company LLC, or Cowen that we entered into in November 2016. We do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for and commercialize A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of SK or one of our other current or future drug candidates. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $45.6 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $136.5 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials, seek marketing approval and pursue commercialization of any approved drug candidate. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our drug candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. In addition, we may incur expenses in connection with the in-license or acquisition of additional drug candidates. Furthermore, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs associated with operating as a public company, including legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions. Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue We recognize revenue when the earnings process is complete, which under SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Topic No. 13, ""Revenue Recognition,"" is when revenue is realized or realizable and earned, there is persuasive evidence a revenue arrangement exists, delivery of goods or services has occurred, the sales price is fixed or determinable, and collectability is reasonably assured. We earn revenue from the provision of laboratory services to clients through Confluence, our wholly-owned subsidiary. Laboratory service revenue is generally evidenced by contracts with clients which are on an agreed upon fixed-price, fee-for-service basis and are generally billed on a monthly basis in arrears for services rendered. Revenue related to these contracts is generally recognized as the laboratory services are performed, based upon the rates specified in the contracts. We also receive revenue from grants under the Small Business Innovation Research program of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH. Through our Confluence subsidiary, we currently have two active grants from NIH which are related to early-stage research. We recognize revenue related to these grants as amounts become reimbursable under each grant, which is generally when research is performed and the related costs are incurred. Table of Contents Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue consists of costs incurred in connection with the provision of laboratory services to our clients through Confluence. Cost of revenue primarily includes: � employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; � outsourced professional scientific services; � depreciation of laboratory equipment; � facility-related costs; and � laboratory materials and supplies used to support the services provided. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our drug candidates. These expenses primarily include: � expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies; � manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials and commercial materials, including manufacturing validation batches; � outsourced professional scientific development services; � employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; � depreciation of manufacturing equipment; � payments made under agreements with third parties under which we have acquired or licensed intellectual property; � expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; and � laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Our direct research and development expenses primarily consist of external costs including fees paid to CROs, consultants, investigator sites, regulatory agencies and third parties that manufacture our preclinical and clinical trial materials, and are tracked on a program-by-program basis. We do not allocate personnel costs, facilities or other indirect expenses, which are included within ""Personnel and other costs"" in the table below, to specific research and development programs. The following table summarizes our research and development expenses for the periods presented:  Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) A-101 Topical Solution (40% and 45%) $ 3,750 $ 3,326 $ 7,031 $ 13,029 JAK inhibitors 2,753 1,893 7,639 4,901 Vixen acquisition - - - 3,385 Other research expenses 407 50 508 140 Total project-related expenses 6,910 5,269 15,178 21,455 Personnel and other costs 2,622 1,270 7,570 3,501 Stock-based compensation 1,332 623 3,853 1,577 Total research and development expenses $ 10,864 $ 7,162 $ 26,601 $ 26,533  Table of Contents Research and development activities are central to our business model. Drug candidates in later stages of clinical development generally have higher development costs than those in earlier stages of clinical development, primarily due to the increased size and duration of later-stage clinical trials. We expect our research and development expenses to increase significantly over the next several years as we increase personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, continue to conduct pre-commercial activities related to A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of SK, and conduct clinical trials and prepare regulatory filings for our other drug candidates. The successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain. At this time, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of, or when, if ever, material net cash inflows may commence from any of our drug candidates. This uncertainty is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials, which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of many factors, including: � the number of clinical sites included in the trials; � the length of time required to enroll suitable patients; � the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trials; � the number of doses patients receive; � the duration of patient follow-up; and � the results of our clinical trials. Our expenditures are subject to additional uncertainties, including the terms and timing of marketing approvals, and the expense of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims or other intellectual property rights. We may never succeed in achieving marketing approval for any of our drug candidates. We may obtain unexpected results from our clinical trials. We may elect to discontinue, delay or modify clinical trials of some drug candidates or focus on others. A change in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of a drug candidate could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of that drug candidate. For example, if the FDA or other regulatory authorities were to require us to conduct clinical trials beyond those that we currently anticipate, or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development. Drug commercialization will take several years and millions of dollars in development costs. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, administrative, finance and legal functions, including stock-based compensation, travel expenses and recruiting expenses. Other general and administrative expenses include facility-related costs, patent filing and prosecution costs, professional fees for marketing, legal, auditing and tax services, insurance costs, as well as payments made under our related party services agreement and milestone payments under our finder's services agreement. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase as a result of increased personnel costs, including stock-based compensation, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal and tax-related services associated with maintaining compliance with NASDAQ and SEC requirements, accounting and investor relations costs, and director and officer insurance premiums associated with being a public company. Additionally, if and when we believe a marketing approval of a drug candidate appears likely, we anticipate an increase in payroll and other expenses as a result of our preparation for commercial operations, especially as it relates to the sales and marketing of that drug candidate. Table of Contents Other Income, Net Other income, net consists of interest earned on our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, interest expense, and gains and losses on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates This discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our condensed consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our condensed consolidated financial statements. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses, contingent consideration and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and use of estimates as disclosed in the footnotes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2017. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include both finite lived and indefinite lived assets. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful life based on the pattern over which the intangible assets are consumed or otherwise used up. If that pattern cannot be reliably determined, the straight-line method of amortization is used. Indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized. In-process research and development assets acquired in a business combination are considered indefinite lived until the completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. We test intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or if indicators of impairment are present. We recognize impairment losses when and to the extent that the estimated fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying value. Contingent Consideration We initially recorded the contingent consideration related to future potential payments based upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones, resulting from the acquisition of Confluence, at its estimated fair value on the date of acquisition. Changes in fair value reflect new information about the likelihood of the payment of the contingent consideration and the passage of time. Future changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration, if any, will be recorded as income or expense in our consolidated statement of operations. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-01, Business Combinations-Clarifying the Definition of a Business (Topic 805). The amendments in this ASU provide a screen to determine when a set of acquired assets and/or activities is not a business.

The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended December 31, 2016, which are included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, on March 15, 2017. Overview We are a dermatologist-led biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing innovative and differentiated therapies to address significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology. Our lead drug candidate, A-101 40% Topical Solution, is a proprietary formulation of high-concentration hydrogen peroxide topical solution that we are developing as a prescription treatment for seborrheic keratosis, or SK, a common non-malignant skin tumor. In the first quarter of 2016, we initiated two multi-center, randomized, double blinded, vehicle-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials and one open-label Phase 3 clinical trial of A-101 40% Topical Solution in patients with SK. In November 2016, we announced positive top-line results from the two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials, which are summarized below. Based on these results, we submitted a New Drug Application, or NDA, for A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of SK to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in February 2017, and the NDA was accepted by the FDA in May 2017. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of the NDA is December 24, 2017. We also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in the European Union in July 2017. We are also developing A-101 45% Topical Solution as a prescription treatment for common warts, also known as verruca vulgaris. Additionally, in 2015, we in-licensed exclusive, worldwide rights to certain inhibitors of the Janus kinase, or JAK, family of enzymes, for specified dermatological conditions, including alopecia areata, or AA, vitiligo and androgenetic alopecia, or AGA. In 2016, we acquired additional intellectual property rights for the development and commercialization of certain JAK inhibitors for specified dermatological conditions. We intend to continue to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates and technologies to build a fully integrated dermatology company. In November 2016, we completed two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of A-101 40% Topical Solution in a combined 937 patients who each had a total of four target SK lesions located on the face, trunk and extremities. Each trial met all primary and secondary endpoints for that trial, achieving clinically and statistically significant clearance of SK lesions. Additionally, we completed an open-label safety trial of A-101 40% Topical Solution in November 2016, in which we enrolled 147 patients. Across all three clinical trials, there were no treatment-related serious adverse events among patients treated with A-101 40% Topical Solution, and the most common adverse events reported were nasopharyngitis and sinusitis which were determined to be unrelated to A-101 40% Topical Solution. Based on these results, we submitted an NDA for A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of SK to the FDA in February 2017, and the NDA was accepted by the FDA in May 2017. The PDUFA target action date for the completion of the FDA's review of the NDA is December 24, 2017. We also submitted an MAA in the European Union in July 2017. If approved, A-101 40% Topical Solution would become the first FDA-approved medication for the treatment of SK. Table of Contents We are also developing A-101 45% Topical Solution for the treatment of common warts. Although common warts are generally not harmful and in most cases eventually clear without medical treatment, they may be painful and aesthetically unattractive and are contagious. On an annual basis, 1.9 million people are diagnosed with common warts. Common warts can be removed with slow-acting, over-the-counter products containing salicylic acid. As with SK, cryosurgery is the most frequently used in-office treatment for common warts. No prescription drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of common warts. We completed a Phase 2 clinical trial in August 2016 evaluating 40% and 45% concentrations of A-101 for the treatment of common warts. In this Phase 2 clinical trial, in which 90 patients completed an eight-week treatment period, we observed statistically significant improvements in the mean change in the Physician's Wart Assessment, or PWA, score and in complete clearance of common warts in patients treated with the 45% concentration of A-101 compared to placebo. In June 2017, we commenced two additional Phase 2 clinical trials of A-101 45% Topical Solution to assess the dose frequency in adult and pediatric patients with common warts. We expect to report results from these additional Phase 2 clinical trials in the first half of 2018. In addition, we are developing the JAK inhibitors, ATI-50001 and ATI-50002, which we in-licensed from Rigel Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Rigel, as potential treatments for AA. AA is an autoimmune dermatologic condition typically characterized by patchy non-scarring hair loss on the scalp and body. More severe forms of AA include total scalp hair loss, known as alopecia totalis, and total hair loss on the scalp and body, known as alopecia universalis. AA affects up to 2.0% of people globally at some point during their lifetime (i.e. incidence) and up to 0.2% of people are affected at any given time (i.e. prevalence) - with two-thirds of affected individuals being 30 years old or younger at the time of disease onset. Treatment options for the less severe, patchy forms of AA include corticosteroids, either topically applied or injected directly into the scalp where the bare patches are located, or the induction of an allergic reaction at the site of hair loss using a topical contact sensitizing agent, an approach known as topical immunotherapy. The same treatment options are utilized for the more severe forms of AA, although utilization of these treatment options for the more severe forms of AA is limited due to limited efficacy, certain side effects, and their impracticality for extensive surface areas. We are developing ATI-50001 as an oral treatment for alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis and ATI-50002 as a topical treatment for patchy AA. We submitted an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, to the FDA for ATI-50001 in October 2016, and we completed a Phase 1 clinical trial to evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of this drug candidate in the first quarter of 2017. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial for ATI-50001, for the treatment of alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis, in the second half of 2017. We submitted an IND to the FDA for ATI-50002, for the treatment of patchy AA, in July 2017, and plan to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial in the second half of 2017. We expect the Phase 2 clinical trials for ATI-50001, for the treatment of alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis, and for ATI-50002, for the treatment of patchy AA, each to take approximately one year to complete. We also plan to develop ATI-50001 and ATI-50002 as potential treatments for vitiligo, a disorder in which white patches of skin appear on different parts of the body. We plan to commence a Phase 2 clinical trial for ATI-50002, for the treatment of vitiligo, in the second half of 2017. In August 2017, we acquired Confluence Life Sciences, Inc. or Confluence. The merger with Confluence will add small molecule drug discovery and preclinical development capabilities which, we expect, will allow us to bring early-stage research and development activities in-house that we currently outsource to third parties. Through the acquisition of Confluence, we also acquired several preclinical product candidates, including additional JAK inhibitors known as ""soft"" JAK inhibitors, as well as inhibitors of the MK-2 signaling pathway and inhibitors of interleukin-2-inducible T cell kinase, or ITK. At the closing of the acquisition, we paid approximately $10.0 million and issued 349,527 shares of our common stock to the former equityholders of Confluence, including amounts deposited into escrow. We are obligated to pay up to $80.0 million to the former Confluence equityholders upon the achievement of specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones, as well as low single-digit royalties upon net sales of covered products and a portion of any amounts we may receive from the further sale, out-license or transfer of the acquired intellectual property to third parties. Since our inception in July 2012, we have devoted substantially all of our resources to organizing and staffing our company, business planning, raising capital, developing A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of SK, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain and engaging in other discovery and clinical Table of Contents activities in dermatology. Through the date of this report, we have not generated any revenue and have financed our operations with sales of our convertible preferred stock, as well as net proceeds from our initial public offering, or IPO, in October 2015, a private placement of our common stock in June 2016, a follow-on public offering of our common stock in November 2016 and our at-the-market facility with Cowen and Company LLC, or Cowen. We do not expect to generate significant revenue unless and until we obtain marketing approval for and commercialize A-101 40% Topical Solution for the treatment of SK or one of our other current or future drug candidates. Since our inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016 and $27.4 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $118.3 million. We expect to incur significant expenses and operating losses for the foreseeable future as we advance our drug candidates from discovery through preclinical development and clinical trials, seek marketing approval and pursue commercialization of any approved drug candidate. In addition, if we obtain marketing approval for any of our drug candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution. In addition, we may incur expenses in connection with the in-license or acquisition of additional drug candidates. Furthermore, we have incurred and expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company, including significant legal, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. As a result, we will need substantial additional funding to support our continuing operations and pursue our growth strategy. Until such time as we can generate significant revenue from product sales, if ever, we expect to finance our operations through the sale of equity, debt financings or other capital sources, including potential collaborations with other companies or other strategic transactions. We may be unable to raise additional funds or enter into such other agreements or arrangements when needed on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. If we fail to raise capital or enter into such agreements as, and when, needed, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and commercialization of one or more of our drug candidates or delay our pursuit of potential in-licenses or acquisitions. Components of Our Results of Operations Revenue We have not generated any revenue since our inception. Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our drug candidates. These expenses include: � expenses incurred under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs, as well as investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and preclinical studies; � manufacturing scale-up expenses and the cost of acquiring and manufacturing preclinical and clinical trial materials and commercial materials, including manufacturing validation batches; � outsourced professional scientific development services; � employee-related expenses, which include salaries, benefits and stock-based compensation; � depreciation of manufacturing equipment; � payments made under agreements with third parties under which we have acquired or licensed intellectual property; � expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to regulatory agencies; and � laboratory materials and supplies used to support our research activities. We expense research and development costs as incurred.

On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and judgments, including those related to accrued expenses and stock-based compensation. We base our estimates on historical experience, known trends and events and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. We believe there have been no material changes to our critical accounting policies and use of estimates as disclosed in the footnotes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 included in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on March 15, 2017. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In January 2017, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Accounting Standards Update, or ASU, 2017-01, Business Combinations-Clarifying the Definition of a Business (Topic 805). The amendments in this ASU provide a screen to determine when a set of acquired assets and/or activities is not a business. The screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired, or disposed of, is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets, the set is not a business. The amendments in this ASU will reduce the number of transactions that meet the definition of a business. ASU 2017-01 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2017, including interim periods within those years, and early adoption will be permitted. We are assessing the potential impact of ASU 2017-01 on our consolidated financial statements. Table of Contents Results of Operations Comparison of Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 Change (In thousands) Revenue $ - $ - $ - Operating expenses: Research and development 7,965 9,836 (1,871) General and administrative 7,330 3,153 4,177 Total operating expenses 15,295 12,989 2,306 Loss from operations (15,295) (12,989) (2,306) Other income, net 457 118 339 Net loss $ (14,838) $ (12,871) $ (1,967)  Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses were $8.0 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $9.8 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease of $1.9 million was primarily driven by a $4.4 million decrease in costs associated with the development of A-101 40% Topical Solution as a result of the completion of our Phase 3 clinical trials in November 2016. The decrease in development costs for A-101 40% Topical Solution was partially offset by an increase of $0.8 million in preclinical development expenses related to the JAK inhibitor technology, an increase of $0.6 million in payroll-related expenses due to higher headcount, an $0.8 million increase in stock-based compensation expense, and a $0.5 million increase in expenses related to medical affairs activities. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses were $7.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $3.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase of $4.2 million was primarily attributable to a $1.0 million one-time milestone payment pursuant to the finder's services agreement related to A-101 40% Topical Solution which was incurred in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $0.4 million in payroll-related expenses due to increased headcount, $1.2 million in higher stock-based compensation expense, and a $0.7 million increase in market research expenses related to pre-commercial activities for A-101 40% Topical Solution. Other Income, Net The increase in other income, net was primarily due to higher invested balances of marketable securities as a result of funds received from our private placement in June 2016, as well as our follow-on public offering in November 2016 and sales under our at-the-market facility with Cowen in April 2017.

This morning, Aclaris Therapeutics most recent news is on our radar and our team decided to put out a fantastic report on the company that is now available for free below: www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=ACRS Common Warts, An Unmet Medical Need Common warts is a condition wherein skin cells are infected by human papillomavirus (HPV) and spreads via direct contact or contact with infected surfaces. Common warts, which look like skin-colored papules with a rough surface, mostly occur on hands. At present, common warts, or verruca vulgaris, affects about 22 million Americans. The condition is more prevalent in children than adults. Over 2 million people take treatment for common warts from healthcare professionals every year, mainly due to symptoms such as pain, bleeding, itching, and burning. As of now, there are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved prescription medications for warts. The currently available over-the-counter topical treatments for common warts are slow and hardly effective. These treatments are known to have undesirable outcomes such as scarring or depigmentation, and mostly require repeated visits. A-101 for Treatment of Warts A-101 45% topical solution (A-101 45%) is an investigational new drug that is being developed as a prescription treatment for common warts. It comprises proprietary high-concentration hydrogen peroxide topical solution. WART-203 Study Design The WART-203 Trial evaluated the safety and efficacy of A-101 45% in comparison to placebo in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial, with a 3-month post-treatment follow-up period. The rationale behind the 3-month follow-up period was to analyze the clinical effect of the twice-weekly treatment regimen for 8 weeks, as well as the durability of the clinical effect. Earlier, A-101 45% met the trial endpoints related to the reduction and clearance of common warts versus placebo in the 56-day treatment period. Post that, subjects continued with the 3-month follow-up portion of the trial. The WART-203 trial assessed 159 subjects who self-administered either A-101 45% or placebo twice-weekly for 56 days, for a total of 16 treatments. Of these 159 subjects, 151 subjects were able to complete the 3-month post-treatment follow-up period in compliance with the protocol. It must be noted that each subject reported between one and six warts at baseline. In this trial, the primary efficacy analysis was based on the mean change from baseline in the Physician's Wart Assessment (PWA) scale score at Day 56 (Visit 8) and Day 134 (Visit 13). The PWA score is a four-point scale of the investigators' static assessment of the severity of a target wart at a particular time point. Significant improvements were noted in common wart reduction and clearance versus placebo among subjects treated with A-101 45% in the 3-month post-treatment follow-up period, i.e. at Day 134. Study Results The primary efficacy analysis of the WART-203 trial At Day 56, the mean reduction in PWA score on the target warts was 0.87 points in subjects who received A-101 45% compared to a mean reduction of 0.17 points for the subjects treated with placebo (p<0.001). At Day 134, the mean reduction in PWA score on the target warts was 1.0 point in subjects who received A-101 45%, in comparison to a reduction of 0.39 points for subjects that received placebo, which is a statistically significant result (p = 0.0004). Secondary and exploratory endpoints of the WART-203 trial At Day 56, subjects who received A-101 45% had 30.2% treated warts that were clear (PWA= 0) compared to 9.2% among subjects in the placebo group (p<0.0001). At Day 134, subjects who received A-101 45% had 39.2% treated warts that were clear compared to 17.2% among subjects in the placebo group (p<0.0001). At Day 56, 25.3% of the subjects who received A-101 45% achieved target wart compared to 2.6% among subjects in the placebo group (p<0.0001). At Day 134, the 37.3% of subjects who received A-101 45% achieved target wart clearance compared to 11.8% among subjects in the placebo group (p<0.0002). At Day 56, the proportion of subjects with all treated wart(s) clear (PWA= 0), stratified by the baseline number of warts treated (1-6), was 19.0% for those who received A-101 45%. This was substantially higher than 2.6% for subjects in the placebo group (P=0.001). At Day 134, the proportion of subjects with all treated wart(s) clear, stratified by the baseline number of warts treated (1-6), was 33.3% for those who received A-101 45% compared to 7.9% for subjects in the placebo group (P=0.0002). Safety Results No treatment-related serious adverse events were observed among subjects treated with A-101 45%.

ACRS,"WAYNE, Pa., Mar 20, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. ACRS, -4.94% a dermatologist-led biopharmaceutical company committed to identifying, developing, and commercializing innovative therapies to address significant unmet needs in aesthetic and medical dermatology and immunology, today announced a publication in the Journal of Experimental Medicine The title of the article is: ""Selective inhibition of the p38a MAPK-MK2 axis inhibits inflammatory cues, including inflammasome priming signals"". ATI-450, an investigational drug formerly known as CDD-450, is a unique p38a MAPK-MK2 pathway selective inhibitor used to uncover the function of this protein complex in inflammasome priming signals. Importantly, ATI-450 is as efficacious as global p38a MAPK inhibitors in decreasing inflammation in disease models. Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndrome (CAPS) and the most severe form of the disease, Neonatal-Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) result from dysregulated inflammasome generating elevated systemic levels of the cytokine IL-1B. As the article elucidates: Selective inhibition of p38a MAPK -MK2 decreases IL-1B, IL-6, and TNF-a production by promoting mRNA instability. ATI-450 attenuates NOMID-associated complications in a transgenic mouse model of CAPS. ATI-450 prevents bone destruction in CAPS mice. ATI-450 inhibits IL-1B in blood cells from CAPS patients ATI-450 prevents inflammation and joint destruction in inflammatory arthritis in rats. ATI-450 selectively blocks p38a MAPK activation of the proinflammatory kinase MK2 while sparing p38a activation of other effectors such as PRAK and ATF2. Use of ATI-450 helped to reveal a critical role of the p38a MAPK -MK2 pathway in NLRP3 inflammasome priming. ATI-450 also inhibited other inflammatory pathways (e.g., TNF-a and IL-6), thus implying potential indications for this drug candidate beyond inflammasopathies. These findings may have potential clinical implications because ATI-450 is at least as efficacious as clinically evaluated global p38a MAPK inhibitors in suppressing inflammation in both animal disease models and patients' cells, and ATI-450's offers the potential lack of transient efficacy and safety issues associated with global p38a MAPK inhibitors which may result from their inhibition of non-MK2 substrates involved in anti-inflammatory and housekeeping functions. This study was carried out by Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. in collaboration with the laboratory of Gabriel Mbalaviele, Ph.D., at Washington University Medical School. The article is available at http://jem.rupress.org/cgi/doi/10.1084/jem.20172063 and will appear in print form on May 7th. About Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.

ACRS,"WAYNE, Pa., Mar 19, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Primary, secondary, and exploratory endpoints of Phase 2 trial met during 8-week treatment period After treatment completed, greater improvement vs. placebo observed in 3-month post-treatment follow-up evaluation If approved, A-101 45% would be the first FDA-approved treatment for common warts Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. ACRS, -4.94% today announced positive results from the 3-month, post-treatment, follow-up evaluation period of its twice-weekly placebo-controlled trial (WART-203) of A-101 45% topical solution (A-101 45%), an investigational new drug consisting of a proprietary high-concentration hydrogen peroxide topical solution being developed as a prescription treatment for common warts (verruca vulgaris). As previously reported, A-101 45% met the trial endpoints related to reduction and clearance of common warts versus placebo during the initial 56-day treatment period. Over the 3-month post-treatment follow-up period, greater improvements in common wart reduction and clearance vs. placebo were observed among subjects treated with A-101 45%. WART-203 evaluated the safety and efficacy of A-101 45% as compared to placebo (vehicle) in a randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trial with a 3-month post-treatment follow-up period. This 3-month follow-up period was designed to understand the clinical effect of the twice weekly treatment regimen for 8 weeks and durability of the clinical effect. Statistically significant results related to common wart reduction and clearance were previously reported after the 56-day treatment period. Subjects then continued into the 3-month follow-up portion of the trial. The WART-203 trial evaluated 159 subjects who self-administered either A-101 45% or placebo twice weekly through Day 56, for a total of 16 treatments. Of the 159 subjects randomized, 151 subjects completed the 3-month post-treatment follow-up period in compliance with the protocol. Each subject had between one and six warts at baseline. The primary efficacy analysis was assessed based on the mean change from baseline in the Physician's Wart Assessment (PWA) scale score at Day 56 (Visit 8) and Day 134 (Visit 13). The PWA score is a four-point scale of the investigators' static assessment of the severity of a target wart at a particular time point. At the end of the 3-month follow-up period, at Day 134, subjects in the A-101 45% group showed greater improvement vs. placebo. The primary efficacy analysis of the WART-203 trial: At Day 56, the mean reduction in PWA score on the target warts was 0.87 points in subjects who received A-101 45%, compared to a mean reduction of 0.17 points for the subjects treated with placebo (p<0.001). At Day 134, the mean reduction in PWA score on the target warts was 1.0 points in subjects who received A-101 45%, compared to a reduction of 0.39 points for subjects that received placebo, a result that was statistically significant (p = 0.0004). Secondary and exploratory endpoints of the WART-203 trial: At Day 56, the percentage of all treated warts that were clear (PWA= 0) was 30.2% in subjects who received A-101 45%, compared to 9.2% among subjects in the placebo group (p<0.0001). At Day 134, the percentage of all treated warts that were clear was 39.2% in subjects who received A-101 45%, compared to 17.2% among subjects in the placebo group (p<0.0001). At Day 56, the proportion of subjects achieving target wart clearance (PWA= 0) was 25.3% among those who received A-101 45%, compared to 2.6% among subjects in the placebo group (p<0.0001). At Day 134, the proportion of subjects achieving target wart clearance was 37.3% among those who received A-101 45%, compared to 11.8% among subjects in the placebo group (p<0.0002). At Day 56, the proportion of subjects with all treated wart(s) clear (PWA= 0), stratified by the baseline number of warts treated (1-6), was 19.0% among those who received A-101 45%, compared to 2.6% among subjects in the placebo group (P=0.001). At Day 134, the proportion of subjects with all treated wart(s) clear, stratified by the baseline number of warts treated (1-6), was 33.3% among those who received A-101 45%, compared to 7.9% among subjects in the placebo group (P=0.0002). Safety Results There were no treatment-related serious adverse events among subjects treated with A-101 45%. A-101 45% was generally well tolerated through visit 13 (Day 134). ""We are extremely pleased by these results,"" said Stu Shanler, M.D., Chief Scientific Officer. ""This is an important milestone for the A-101 45% wart program, and these data further substantiate the potential clinical utility of our proprietary formulation of A-101 45% topical solution. Based on these results, we plan to meet with the FDA mid-year regarding our Phase 3 program for the treatment of common warts. We expect to initiate our Phase 3 program in the second half of 2018."" About Common Warts Common warts, also called verruca vulgaris, affect more than 22 million Americans. Prevalence is higher in children than adults. Common warts most often appear on the hands and usually look like skin-colored papules with a rough surface. They result when skin cells are infected by human papillomavirus (HPV) and spread via direct contact or contact with infected surfaces. Though common warts may resolve without treatment, they can persist for years. Over-the-counter topical treatments are first-line therapy for common warts but are marginally effective and slow to work. More than two million patients seek treatment for common warts from healthcare professionals each year, possibly because of social stigma, embarrassment or symptoms such as pain, bleeding, itching and burning. There are currently no FDA-approved prescription medications for warts, and existing treatment procedures are often painful or invasive, can have undesirable outcomes like scarring or dyspigmentation, and often require repeat visits. About Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. is a dermatologist-led biopharmaceutical company committed to identifying, developing, and commercializing innovative therapies to address significant unmet needs in dermatology, both aesthetic and medical, and immunology. Aclaris' focus on market segments with no FDA-approved medications or where treatment gaps exist has resulted in the first FDA-approved treatment for raised seborrheic keratoses and several clinical programs to develop medications for the potential treatment of common warts, alopecia areata, and vitiligo.

The '301 Patent contains 67 claims and expires in November 2031.  This newly allowed patent is owned by The Trustees of Columbia University in the City of New York and exclusively licensed to Aclaris and is the latest U.S. patent to issue in connection with Aclaris' JAK drug development program for hair loss disorders.  Recently added to the NASDAQ Biotechnology Index NBI, +0.68% Financial Highlights Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2017, Aclaris had aggregate cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $208.9 million compared to $174.1 million as of December 31, 2016. The $34.8 million increase during the year ended December 31, 2017 included: Aggregate net proceeds of $100.2 million from the sale of common stock under an at-the-market facility with Cowen and Company LLC in April 2017 and a follow-on public offering of common stock in August 2017.  $9.6 million of cash used to acquire Confluence in August 2017, net of cash acquired.  $1.2 million of purchases of property and equipment.  Net loss of $68.5 million, offset by $0.9 million of net cash provided by working capital and $14.8 million of non-cash stock-based compensation expense, depreciation and amortization. Aclaris anticipates that its cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities as of December 31, 2017 will be sufficient to fund its operations into the second half of 2019, without giving effect to any potential new business development transactions or financing activities. Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results Net loss was $22.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $11.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Upon new tax legislation passed in December 2017, Aclaris recognized an income tax benefit of $1.8 million related to the reversal of the deferred tax liability associated with the In-Process Research and Development recognized in the Confluence acquisition earlier this year.  Revenue of $1 million and cost of revenue of $0.8 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 related to our contract research business acquired in August 2017.  Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $25.7 million, compared to $11.6 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. Research and development expenses were $13.2 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $6.9 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of $6.3 million was primarily attributable to a $2.3 million increase in expenses related to the WART-202 and WART-203 trials, a $1.5 million increase in personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to increased headcount, a $2 million increase in preclinical and clinical trial development expenses related to the JAK inhibitor portfolio and a $1.5 million increase in Medical Affairs expenses and other costs, including early stage drug discovery. This increase was partially offset by a $1.3 million decrease due to the completion of our ESKATA Phase 3 clinical trials and the submission preparation of the NDA for ESKATA in November 2016.  General and administrative expenses were $12.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $4.7 million for the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase of $7.8 million was primarily attributable to $2.9 million in higher personnel-related expenses, including stock-based compensation, due to increased headcount, and a $1 million increase related to relocating our corporate headquarters and administrative costs related to our St. Louis, Missouri operations acquired in August 2017. Additionally, Aclaris incurred a $3.3 million increase in market research and sales operations expenses related to pre-commercial activities for ESKATA. Full Year 2017 Financial Results Net loss was $68.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $48.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Revenue of $1.7 million and cost of revenue of $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 related to the contract research business acquired in August 2017.  Total operating expenses were $72.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $48.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Net cash used in operating activities was $54.7 million, compared to $34.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2016.  Research and development expenses were $39.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $33.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $6.3 million was due to higher payroll-related expenses of $5.6 million due to increased headcount, including stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $4.5 million in preclinical and clinical trial development expenses related to our JAK inhibitor portfolio, an increase of $3.4 million in expenses related to the WART-202 and WART-203 trials, and a $3.6 million increase in medical affairs and early stage drug discovery activities. The increases noted above were partially offset by a $7.7 million decrease related to our ESKATA Phase 3 clinical trials costs, which were completed in November 2016, and $3.4 million in costs incurred with the acquisition of Vixen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. in the year ended December 31, 2016. General and administrative expenses were $33.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $15.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase of $18 million was primarily attributable to an increase of $9.3 million in payroll-related expenses due to increased headcount, including stock-based compensation expense, an increase of $6.1 million in pre-commercial launch activities for ESKATA, a $1.3 million increase in facilities-related costs, and a $1.3 million increase in other professional fees. As of December 31, 2017, Aclaris had approximately 30.8 million shares of common stock outstanding. 2018 Financial Outlook Aclaris expects 2018 GAAP research and development (R&D) expenses to be in the range of $67 to $75 million, which, when excluding estimated stock-based compensation of $9 million, results in 2018 non-GAAP R&D expense of $58 to $66 million. The anticipated increase in R&D expenses in 2018 is mainly due to the planned execution of Phase 2 clinical trials in AA, AGA, and vitiligo, two planned pivotal Phase 3 trials in common warts, and development of our early stage pipeline compounds.  Aclaris expects 2018 GAAP selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses to be in the range of $80 to $86 million, which, when excluding estimated stock-based compensation of $14 million, results in 2018 non-GAAP SG&A expense of $66 to $72 million. The anticipated increase in SG&A expenses in 2018 is primarily the result of the deployment of our new sales force in January 2018 and the additional selling, marketing and consumer initiatives to support the commercial launch of ESKATA.

ACRS,"MALVERN, Pa., Jan 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Highly statistically significant results on all primary and secondary endpoints Statistical significance seen as early as day 28, after 4 weeks of treatment in WART-203 If approved, A-101 45% would be the first FDA approved treatment for common warts Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. ACRS, -4.94% a dermatologist-led biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing innovative and differentiated therapies to address significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology, today announced positive results from its two Phase 2 clinical trials (WART-202 and WART-203) of A-101 45% topical solution (A-101 45%), an investigational new drug for the treatment of common warts (verruca vulgaris). A-101 45% met all primary and secondary endpoints of each trial, achieving clinically and statistically significant clearance of common warts. A-101 45% is a proprietary high-concentration hydrogen peroxide topical solution being developed as a prescription treatment for common warts. Both trials evaluated the safety and efficacy of A-101 45% as compared to placebo (vehicle). The two randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled trials were designed to understand the effects of dose frequency and to explore additional clinical endpoints that will be further evaluated in a planned Phase 3 development program. The WART-203 trial evaluated 159 patients who self-administered either A-101 45% or placebo twice weekly through Day 56, for a total of 16 treatments. Each patient had between one and six warts at baseline. The trial achieved its primary endpoint, which was mean change from baseline in the Physician's Wart Assessment (PWA) scale score at Day 56 (Visit 10 or one week after the last treatment). The PWA score is a four-point scale of the investigators' assessment of the severity of a target wart at a particular time point. The mean reduction in PWA score at Day 56 on the target warts was 0.87 points in patients who received A-101 45%, compared to a reduction of 0.17 points for the target warts that received placebo, a result that was statistically significant (p<0.001). Secondary endpoints of the WART-203 trial: The percentage of all treated warts that were clear (PWA = 0) at Day 56 was 30.20% in patients who received A-101 45%, compared to 9.22% among patients in the placebo group (p<0.001). The percentage of all treated warts that were clear or near-clear (PWA <= 1) at Day 56 was 45.64% among patients who received A-101 45%, compared to 15.60% among patients in the placebo group (p<0.001). The proportion of patients achieving target wart clearance at Day 56 was 25.32% among those who received A-101 45%, compared to 2.56% among patients in the placebo group (p<0.0001). The proportion of patients with all treated wart(s) clear at Day 56, stratified by the baseline number of warts treated (1-6), was 18.99% among those who received A-101 45%, compared to 2.56% among patients in the placebo group (P=0.001). The WART-202 trial evaluated 157 patients who self-administered either A-101 45% or placebo once weekly through Day 56, for a total of 8 treatments. Each patient had between one and four warts at baseline. The trial achieved its primary endpoint, which was mean change from baseline in the PWA score of the target wart at Day 56 (one week after the last treatment). The mean reduction in PWA score at Day 56 on the target warts was 0.77 points in patients who received A-101 45%, compared to a reduction of 0.23 points for the target warts that received placebo, a result that was also statistically significant (p<0.001). Secondary endpoints of the WART-202 trial: The percentage of all treated warts that were clear at Day 56 was 20.75% in patients who received A-101 45%, compared to 2.94% among patients in the placebo group (p<0.001). The percentage of all treated warts that were clear or near-clear at Day 56 was 52.83% among patients who received A-101 45%, compared to 13.73% among patients in the placebo group (p<0.001). The proportion of patients achieving target wart clearance at Day 56 was 15.71% among those who received A-101 45%, compared to 1.37% among patients in the placebo group (p<0.001). The proportion of patients with all treated wart(s) clear at Day 56, stratified by the baseline number of warts treated (1-4), was 11.43% among those who received A-101 45%, compared to 1.37% among patients in the placebo group (P=0.01). Patients in both of the WART-202 and WART-203 trials are continuing in a 3-month open-label drug-free follow-up evaluation to assess the durability of clinical effect. Safety Results There were no treatment-related serious adverse events among patients treated with A-101 45%. A-101 45% was well tolerated through visit 10 (Day 56). ""We are extremely pleased by these results,"" said Dr. Neal Walker, President and CEO of Aclaris. ""This is an important milestone for the A-101 45% wart program, and these data further substantiate the potential clinical utility of our proprietary formulation of A-101 45% topical solution. Based on these results, we plan to meet with the FDA mid-year regarding our Phase 3 program for the treatment of common warts. We expect to initiate our Phase 3 program in the second half of 2018."" About Common Warts Common warts, also called verruca vulgaris, affect more than 22 million Americans. Prevalence is higher in children than adults. Common warts most often appear on the hands and usually look like skin-colored papules with a rough surface. They result when skin cells are infected by human papillomavirus (HPV) and spread via direct contact or contact with infected surfaces. Though common warts may resolve without treatment, they can persist for years. Over-the-counter topical treatments are first-line therapy for common warts but are marginally effective and slow to work. More than two million patients seek treatment for common warts from healthcare professionals each year, possibly because of social stigma, embarrassment or symptoms such as pain, bleeding, itching and burning. There are currently no FDA-approved prescription medications for warts, and existing treatment procedures are often painful or invasive, can have undesirable outcomes like scarring or dyspigmentation, and often require repeat visits.

ACRS, -4.94% a dermatologist-led biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing, and commercializing innovative and differentiated therapies to address significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology, today announced that it has initiated a Phase 2 open-label clinical trial of ATI-50002, a topical Janus Kinase (JAK) 1/3 inhibitor (ATI-50002 Topical) and an investigational drug, for the potential treatment of non-segmental vitiligo of the face. This trial will evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of ATI-50002 Topical applied twice daily in 24 adult subjects with non-segmental vitiligo of the face. This 24-week trial will be conducted at 3 investigational centers within the United States. ""This trial is the first step in evaluating the potential clinical benefit of ATI-50002 Solution in treating patients with non-segmental vitiligo of the face,"" said Dr. Stuart Shanler, Chief Scientific Officer of Aclaris. ""This is an important step forward in understanding the clinical utility of our JAK program in patients with vitiligo."" About Vitiligo Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease in which the pigment producing skin cells (melanocytes) are progressively lost from the skin. As a result, pigment (melanin) is absent and areas of skin appear to be lighter on various parts of the body. The cause of vitiligo is unknown; however, an autoimmune-mediated destruction of the pigment cells is currently the most favored theory. Impacting one to two percent of the global population, vitiligo is considered the most frequently occurring depigmenting disorder. Irrespective of sex, race or age, the condition is more prominently found in darker skinned individuals. Its sufferers may experience reduced quality of life and psychological distress. None of the currently available treatment options are perceived to manage vitiligo adequately. There are currently no FDA-approved medications for vitiligo that restore pigmentation.

This morning, Aclaris Therapeutics most recent news is on our radar and we have decided to include it on our blog post. Today's free coverage is available at: www.active-investors.com/registration-sg/?symbol=ACRS SKs are common skin growths that are non-cancerous but aesthetically unappealing and usually found in areas like the face and neck. As per an estimate, nearly 83 million American adults are afflicted by this skin condition and typically increases in size as a person ages. The condition is more widespread than the three most common skin conditions - acne, psoriasis, and rosacea put together. About ESKATA™? Aclaris' ESKATA™ is a proprietary, non-invasive high-concentration (40%) hydrogen peroxide-based topical solution. It is designed in such a manner that a healthcare provider can easily treat a patient with an in-office application using a pen-like applicator directly on the raised SKs. The treatment is non-invasive has a low risk of scarring. The treatment is recommended only with the consultation of a healthcare provider with expertise in diagnosing skin conditions and is not suitable for use at home Aclaris' ESKATA™ received approval from FDA after the Company completed two pivotal Phase-3 clinical trials which confirmed the safety and efficacy of ESKATA™ for the treatment of raised SKs. The patients at the clinical trials were given two applications of the treatment, once at the start of the trial and the second application in the third week. The data from these clinical trials indicated that patients treated with ESKATA™ were more likely to have all four treated SKs completely cleared after two treatments compared to those patients who received placebo treatment. The treatment was mostly tolerable for patients treated with ESKATA™. There were some incidences of side effects which included symptoms like itching, stinging, crusting, swelling, redness, and scaling at the site of application. According to a consumer survey conducted by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS), there is a need for the effective treatment of SKs. Aclaris' ESKATA™ has the distinction of being the first topical treatment option available with physicians to satisfy this unmet patient need. The Company plans to launch the product commercially as a self-pay aesthetic treatment in Q2 2018. The Company has also been planning to commercially launch ESKATA™ in the European markets and has applied for a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for ESKATA™ with the European Union. Management Comments Commenting on the receipt of FDA's approval for ESKATA™, Dr. Neal Walker, President and CEO of Aclaris., said: ""This achievement delivers on Aclaris' commitment to bringing innovative therapies to market that address significant unmet needs in dermatology. For the first time, with the approval of ESKATA™, patients will have access to an FDA-approved topical, non-invasive treatment for raised SKs."" Stuart D. Shanler, M.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Aclaris, added: ""We are proud to offer ESKATA™ to dermatologists and their patients as a treatment that can clear raised SKs without cutting, burning, or freezing the skin. As a clinician, I saw first-hand that patients preferred non-invasive treatments."" Anne M. Chapas, M.D., FAAD, Founder and Medical Director of Union Square Dermatology, Clinical Instructor of Dermatology, Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York and a consultant for Aclaris.

""With the approval of ESKATA, I am pleased to be able to offer my patients a topical treatment option that is well tolerated and can clear raised SKs with a low risk of scarring."" The FDA approval of ESKATA is based on two pivotal Phase 3 trials that demonstrated the safety and efficacy of ESKATA for the treatment of raised SKs. In these trials, patients received up to two treatments with ESKATA, with one at treatment initiation and a second at week three. Patients treated with ESKATA were more likely to have all four treated SKs completely cleared after two treatments than patients who received placebo. Treatment with ESKATA was generally well tolerated, with the most common side effects being itching, stinging, crusting, swelling, redness and scaling at the site of application. It is important to see a healthcare provider with expertise in diagnosing skin conditions to confirm the diagnosis of SKs and determine whether ESKATA is an appropriate treatment. ""A recent consumer survey by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery (ASDS) supports the need for an effective treatment of SKs,"" said Lisa Donofrio, M.D., ASDS President. ""ESKATA provides physicians with the first topical treatment option to satisfy this unmet patient need.""

ACRS,"BETHESDA, Md., Dec. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Epidarex Capital (""Epidarex""), an early-stage, transatlantic life science venture fund, today announced that its portfolio company, Harpoon Medical, Inc. (""Harpoon""), a pioneer in beating-heart repair for degenerative mitral regurgitation (DMR), has been acquired by Edwards Lifesciences for up to $250 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, Edwards paid $100 million in cash for Harpoon at closing on December 1, 2017 with a potential for up to an additional $150 million in pre-specified milestone-driven payments.  Epidarex was among Harpoon's earliest supporters, funding the development of the company's core technology shortly after it was spun-out of the University of Maryland, Baltimore (UMB). Epidarex led the Series A funding. As part of the subsequent Series B funding, Edwards secured an option to acquire Harpoon.  ""Having been actively involved with Harpoon since its early days, this is an exciting milestone for the company, for the University of Maryland Baltimore and for Epidarex,"" said Kyp Sirinakis, Managing Partner, Epidarex. ""Harpoon is a good example of how Epidarex identifies and funds the most promising early-stage technologies in under-ventured markets. Harpoon exemplifies the Epidarex strategy of successfully building highly innovative companies that are addressing large, unmet medical needs with solutions that provide significant benefits to patients."" The Harpoon acquisition follows the successful sale of Confluence Life Sciences, Inc., to Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. ACRS, -4.94% in August for a total deal value of up to $100 million in up-front and milestone payments, and the completion of the Apellis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. APLS, -7.87% initial public offering announced in November of this year. Epidarex was also one of Apellis' earliest backers, identifying and funding its promising technology platform.   Harpoon's lead product is an investigational device designed to facilitate beating-heart minimally invasive echo-guided mitral valve repair. Pivotal clinical trial results of this investigational device showed positive safety data and procedural outcomes, as well as symptom improvement. Patients also had no need to take blood thinners following the procedure.  ""Operating at the nexus of technology innovation and academic research found in our region, Epidarex clearly understood our needs and had the experience necessary for a medical technology company at our stage of development to be successful,"" said Bill Niland, President and CEO, Harpoon Medical, Inc. ""We had the strong science and technology but needed the right champion to lead the investor syndicate required to fund our early human studies. Epidarex provided that leadership."" Universities outside the major life science hubs are often a source for promising technologies that address unmet medical need, but lack the early-stage funding that is essential to commercialize their products. The BioHealth Capital Region is no exception with innovation hot spots powering science and technology breakthroughs. ""Harpoon, an exceptional UMB startup company founded on innovative intellectual property developed by Dr. Gammie and his team at the University of Maryland School of Medicine, has wisely taken advantage of the funding resources available through both UMB and the State of Maryland,"" said Jay A. Perman, M.D., President, University of Maryland, Baltimore. ""Eventually however, most successful life sciences companies will require significantly greater capital and additional financing sources to continue to move towards commercialization, which is why UMB's Office of Tech Transfer has developed a strong working relationship with the team at Epidarex.""  About Degenerative Mitral RegurgitationMitral valve prolapse is a condition in which the two valve flaps of the mitral valve do not close smoothly or evenly, but instead bulge (prolapse) upward into the left atrium causing regurgitation or backflow of blood from incomplete closure of the valve. Mitral regurgitation (MR) affects millions of people worldwide. It is the most common type of heart valve insufficiency in the United States and the second most common in Europe where prevalence and incidence are similar to the United States. Approximately four million people in the United States have significant mitral valve insufficiency, with an annual incidence of 250,000. Approximately 50,000 patients in the United States undergo surgery each year for MR. About Epidarex CapitalEpidarex invests in early-stage, high-growth life science and health technology companies in under-ventured markets in the United States and United Kingdom. With offices in Bethesda, Maryland, and in Edinburgh, Scotland, Epidarex builds successful companies from world-class medical research to achieve commercial, patient-driven success. The Epidarex international management team has a track record of successfully partnering with scientists and entrepreneurs to develop highly innovative products for the global healthcare market. www.epidarex.com View original content with multimedia:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/epidarex-capital-portfolio-company-harpoon-medical-acquired-by-edwards-lifesciences-300568196.html SOURCE Epidarex Capital Copyright (C) 2017 PR Newswire.

ACRS,"MALVERN, Pa., Nov 21, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc. ACRS, -4.94% a dermatologist-led, biopharmaceutical company focused on identifying, developing and commercializing innovative and differentiated therapies to address significant unmet needs in medical and aesthetic dermatology, today announced that Dr. Gabriel Mbalaviele presented data from pre-clinical studies of Aclaris' recently acquired drug candidate, ATI-450 (formerly known as CDD-450), a selective inhibitor of the p38/MK2 pathway, at a symposium at the American College of Rheumatology annual meeting earlier this month. The abstract summarizing the data is titled ""NOMID-Associated Complications in Mice Are Prevented By CDD-450, a Small Molecule Inhibitor of the Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase-Activated Protein Kinase 2 (MK2) Pathway."" In pre-clinical studies, ATI-450 was active in blocking multiple manifestations of the Neonatal-onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID) form of Cryopyrin associated periodic syndromes (CAPS) using an inducible transgenic murine model of the disease. CAPS are a spectrum of diseases arising from the gain of function mutations in NLRP3, a key component of the inflammasome, resulting in elevated systemic IL-B levels. Furthermore, ATI-450 inhibited cold-induced production of IL-1B from the blood of patients with another CAPS syndrome, Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS). These results confirm the key role of the p38/MK2 pathway in the IL-1B biosynthetic pathway and suggest the potential for ATI-450 to be an oral treatment for CAPS. ""This data is compelling, and clearly, further evaluation of ATI-450 as a potential oral treatment for CAPS is warranted,"" said Dr. Joseph Monahan, Executive Vice President, Research & Development of Aclaris. ""We look forward to advancing this program towards the clinic."" About Aclaris Therapeutics, Inc.
