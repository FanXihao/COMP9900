ACMR,"What was hyped as the biggest week for initial public offerings in months started out hot, then fell flat, as a number of stocks made their debut below their IPO prices. No less than eight companies went public in the week ending Nov. 3, the most since the week ending June 30, according to market intelligence firm Ipreo. The total proceeds raised, about $2.4 billion, was also the most since June. The less-than-stellar IPO performance comes during a week that the both the Renaissance IPO IPO, +1.24% and the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.38%  hit record highs. That may not bode well for next week, which could feature as many as 10 IPOs that raise a total of about $2 billion, Ipreo said. The week started out with a bang, with the shares of engineering and cloud computing software company Altair Engineering Inc.’s ALTR, +1.98%  IPO pricing at $13 a share, at the top of the expected range of $11-to-$13 a share. The stock opened at $17 at 10:36 a.m. ET, or 31% above its IPO price. It ran up to an intraday high of $18.98 on its first day, then rallied further to close at $19.37 Friday. Don’t miss: IPO market heats up as stocks of first of 8 deals this week rocket in their debut. TimeRenaissance IPO ETF15 Jan29 Jan12 Feb26 Feb12 Mar26 Mar US:IPO $27 $28 $29 $30 The same day, shares of Argentine cement and concrete maker Loma Negra Compania Industrial Argentina LOMA, -0.19%  made its debut at $21.65 at 10:57 a.m. That was 14% above the IPO price of $19 a share, which was also at the top of the expected range, of $15 to $19. Since then, it has traded in a range of $21 to $22.15, and closed at $21.50 on Friday. But then things went south. Toy and consumer products company Funko Inc. FNKO, +0.00%  was by far the worst performer of the week. The company’s IPO not only priced at $12, below its expected range of $14 to $16, but the offering also dropped its offering to 10.42 million Class A shares from 11.61 million. So the company raised $125 million from the IPO, before options granted to underwriters, compared with previous expectations that it could raise up to $185.7 million. The opening was delayed till 11:35 a.m., at $8, or 33% below its offering price. The stock fell even further to close Thursday at $7.07. It fell 1.0% on Friday. “We can’t get too caught up on what happens on Day 1,” said Chief Executive Brian Mariotti, in a phone interview with MarketWatch. “We’re going to be here for a long time.” After-HoursTime (EDT)Funko Inc. Cl A12:004:0029 Mar4:00 US:FNKO $8.00 $8.05 $8.10 $8.15 $8.20 Before Funko, the first trade of Spero Therapeutics Inc.’s stock SPRO, +0.42%  was at 10:03 a.m. Thursday at $13.25. That was 5.4% below the IPO price of $14 a share, which was at the bottom of the expected range of $14 to $16. Shares of the developer of treatments of resistant bacterial infections kept falling, to end the first day 18% below its IPO price at $11.50. The stock rose 0.5% on Friday. Water treatment company Evoqua Water Technologies Corp.’s stock AQUA, +1.14%  then opened at $19 at 10:12 a.m., or 5.6% above the IPO price of $18 a share, which was price in the middle of the expected range of $17 to $19. It rose a further 9.9% to close at $20.88 on Thursday, but then pulled back 2.7% on Friday. Biopharmaceutical company Allena Pharmaceuticals Inc.’s stock ALNA, +6.17%  was next, opening at $12 at 11 a.m. That was 14% below the IPO price of $14, which priced at the bottom of the expected range of $14 to $16. It tumbled even further, closing down 29% below its IPO price at $10, then fell 1.9% on Friday. On Friday, shares of both companies going public rose, but only after their IPOs priced below expectations. Shares of Aquantia Corp. AQ, +3.36% a maker of high-speed communications integrated circuits for Ethernet connections, opened at 10:29 a.m. at $9.40, or 4.4% above the IPO price of $9. That price was below the expected pricing range of $10 to $12. The stock closed up 5.7% at $9.51. And chip equipment maker ACM Research Inc.’s IPO ACMR, -0.65%  priced at $5.60, well below the expected range of $7.50 to $9.50. So although the stock closed up 8.0% at $6.05 Friday, it was still trading below the expected range, and has fallen sharply from its 11:11 a.m. opening price of $8.17. For next week, technology IPOs could include China-based Sogou Inc. SOGO, +0.61%  and Bandwidth Inc. BAND, +1.78% according to Ipreo; health care IPOs could include Germany’s Fireman B.V. IFRX, -4.60%  and Apellis Pharmaceuticals Inc. APLS, -7.87% ; IPOs in the financial sector could include Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp. MCB, -5.71%  and China’s PPDAI Group Inc.

ACMR,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7: Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this report. In addition to historical information, the following discussion contains forward-looking statements that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions. See ""Forward-Looking Statements and Statistical Data"" at page 4 of this report. Please read ""Item1A. Risk Factors"" for a discussion of factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations. Overview We develop, manufacture and sell single-wafer wet cleaning equipment, which semiconductor manufacturers can use in numerous manufacturing steps to remove particles, contaminants and other random defects, and thereby improve product yield, in fabricating advanced integrated circuits, or chips. Our Ultra C equipment is designed to remove random defects from a wafer surface effectively, without damaging a wafer or its features, even at an increasingly advanced process node (the minimum line width on a chip) of 22 nanometers, or nm, or less. Our equipment is based on our innovative, proprietary Space Alternated Phase Shift, or SAPS, and Timely Energized Bubble Oscillation, or TEBO, technologies. We developed our proprietary technologies to enable manufacturers to produce chips that reach their ultimate physical limitations while maintaining product yield, which is the percentage of chips on a wafer that meet manufacturing specifications We seek to market our wet processing equipment by first establishing a referenceable base of leading logic and memory chip makers, whose use of our products can influence decisions by other manufacturers. We believe this process will help us to penetrate the mature integrated circuit manufacturing markets and to build credibility with industry leaders. We have placed evaluation SAPS equipment with selected memory and logic chip customers since 2009 and recognized revenue from SAPS equipment since 2011. Using a similar ""demo-to-sales"" process, we began placing TEBO evaluation equipment with selected customers in 2016 and recognized revenue from our initial sale of TEBO equipment in December 2016. As of December 31, 2017, we had sold and deployed more than 30 single-wafer wet cleaning tools. We recognized revenue from the selected customers' purchases of single-wafer wet cleaning equipment totaling $27.1 million, or 74.2% of our revenue, in 2017 and $21.5 million, or 78.4% of our revenue, in 2016. We market and sell our products worldwide using a combination of our direct sales force and third-party representatives. We employ direct sales teams in Asia, Europe and North America, and have located these teams near our customers, primarily in the People's Republic of China, or PRC, Korea, Taiwan and the United States. To supplement our direct sales teams, we have contacts with several independent sales representatives in the PRC, Taiwan and Korea. We also provide after-sales services to our customers by installing new replacement parts as well as making small scale modifications to improve our customers' product yields. We established our operational center in Shanghai in 2006 to help us establish and build relationships with chip manufacturers in China and throughout Asia. In addition to our SAPS and TEBO tools, we offer a range of custom-made wafer assembly and packaging equipment, such as coaters and developers, to wafer assembly and packaging factories, principally in the PRC. Corporate Background ACM Research incorporated in California in 1998 and redomesticated to Delaware in November 2016. Key events in our corporate development have included: ? ? ? Table of Contents ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Recent Equity Transactions Issuance of Warrant In December 2016 Shengxin (Shanghai) Management Consulting Limited Partnership, or SMC, delivered to our subsidiary ACM Shanghai 20,123,500 RMB (approximately $3.0 million as of the date of funding) in cash, which we refer to as the SMC Investment, for potential investment pursuant to terms to be subsequently negotiated. SMC is a PRC limited partnership owned by Jian Wang, our Vice President, Research and Development and the brother of our Chair of the Board, Chief Executive Officer and President, David H. Wang, and other employees of ACM Shanghai. In March 2017 we issued to SMC a warrant exercisable to purchase 397,502 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $7.50 per share, for a total exercise price of approximately $3.0 million. The warrant may be exercised for cash or on a cashless basis, at the option of SMC, at any time on or before May 17, 2023 to acquire all, but not less than all, of the shares of Class A common stock subject to the warrant. ? ? In connection with the completion of IPO on November 2, 2017, we issued a five-year warrant to Roth Capital Partners, LLC, the Company's IPO underwriter, up to 80,000 shares (""Underwriter's Warrant) of the Company's Class A common stock at the exercise price of $6.16. The Underwriter's Warrant is immediately exercisable and expires on November 1, 2022. Table of Contents Acquisition of Outstanding Minority Interests in Our Operating Company Until August 31, 2017, ACM Research owned 62.87% of the outstanding equity interests in ACM Shanghai and three PRC-based third-party investors held the remaining 37.13% of equity interests, which were reflected as ""non-controlling interests"" in our consolidated balance sheets and related notes. We took the following actions in order to enable ACM Research to acquire, consistent with requirements of arrangements previously entered into in connection with the investors' acquisition of ACM Shanghai equity interests, the outstanding non-controlling interests in ACM Shanghai: ? ? ? Since November 8, 2017, ACM Research has owned all of the outstanding equity interests in ACM Shanghai. Strategic Investment in Key Supplier Ninebell Co., Ltd., or Ninebell, which is located in Seoul, Korea, is the principal supplier of robotic delivery system subassemblies used in our single-wafer cleaning equipment. On September 6, 2017 we and Ninebell entered into: ? ? In addition, under the ordinary share purchase agreement, Ninebell granted us a preemptive right for all future issuances of equity-related securities by Ninebell and the founder of Ninebell, who is the only other equity holder of Ninebell, granted us a right of first refusal with respect to any future sales of his equity securities. Key Components of Results of Operations Revenue We develop, manufacture and sell single-wafer wet cleaning equipment and custom-made wafer assembly and packaging equipment. Because we currently sell our capital equipment, or tools, to a small number of customers and we customize those tools to fulfill the customers' specific requirements, our revenue generation fluctuates, depending on the length of the sales, development and evaluation phases: Table of Contents Sales and Development. During the sale process we may, depending on a prospective customer's specifications and requirements, need to perform additional research, development and testing to establish that a tool can meet the prospective customer's requirements. We then host an in-house demonstration of the customized tool prototype. Sales cycles for orders that require limited customization and do not require that we develop new technology usually take from 6 to 12 months, while the product life cycle, including the initial design, demonstration and final assembly phases, for orders requiring development and testing of new technologies can take as long as 2 to 4 years. As we expand our customer base, we expect to gain more repeat purchase orders for tools that we have already developed and tested, which will eliminate the need for a demonstration phase and shorten the development cycle. Evaluation Periods. When a chip manufacturer proposes to purchase a particular type of tool from us for the first time, we offer the manufacturer an opportunity to evaluate the tool for a period that can extend for 24 months or longer. We do not receive any payment on first-time purchases until the tool is accepted. As a result, we may spend between $1.0 and $2.0 million to produce a tool without receiving payment for more than 24 months or, if the tool is not accepted, without receiving any payment. Please see ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-We may incur significant expenses long before we can recognize revenue from new products, if at all, due to the costs and length of research, development, manufacturing and customer evaluation process cycles."" Purchase Orders. In accordance with industry practice, sales of our tools are made pursuant to purchase orders. Each purchase order from a customer for one of our tools contains specific technical requirements intended to ensure, among other things, that the tool will be compatible with the customer's manufacturing process line. Until a purchase order is received, we do not have a binding purchase commitment. Our SAPS and TEBO customers to date have provided us with non-binding one- to two-year forecasts of their anticipated demands, and we expect future customers to furnish similar non-binding forecasts for planning purposes. Any of those forecasts would be subject to change, however, by the customer at any time, without notice to us. Fulfillment. We seek to obtain a purchase order for a tool from three to four months in advance of the expected delivery date. Depending upon the nature of a customer's specifications, the lead time for production of a tool generally will extend from two to four months. The lead-time can be as long as six months, however, and in some cases we may need to begin producing a tool based on a customer's non-binding forecast, rather than waiting to receive a binding purchase order. We expect our sales prices generally to range between $2.5 million and $5.0 million for SAPs tools and between $3.5 million and $6.5 million for TEBO tools. The sales price of a particular tool will vary depending upon the required specifications. We have designed equipment models using a modular configuration that we customize to meet customers' technical specifications. For example, our Ultra C models for SAPS and TEBO solutions use modular configurations that enable us to create a wet-cleaning tool meeting a customer's specific requirements, while using pre-existing designs for chamber, electrical, chemical delivery and other modules. Because of the relatively large purchase prices of our tools, customers generally pay in installments. For a customer's repeat purchase of a particular type of tool, the specific payment terms are negotiated in connection with acceptance of a purchase order. Based on our limited experience with repeat sales of SAPS and TEBO tools, we expect that we will receive an initial payment upon delivery of a tool in connection with a repeat purchase, with the balance being paid once the tool has been tested and accepted by the customer. Our sales arrangements for repeat purchases do not include a general right of return. Since introducing SAPS technology in 2009, we have focused on selling SAPS-based tools and, beginning in 2016, TEBO-based tools. Our revenue from sales of single-wafer wet cleaning equipment totaled $27.1 million, or 74.2% of our revenue, in 2017 and $21.5 million, or 78.4% of our revenue, in 2016. We have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers as the result of our strategy of initially placing SAPS- and TEBO-based equipment with a small number of leading chip manufacturers that are driving technology trends and key capability implementation. In 2017, 55.2% of our revenue was derived from four customers: SK Hynix Inc., a leading Korean memory chip company that accounted for 18.1% of our revenue; Shanghai Huali Integrated Circuit Research and Development Center Ltd., a public research consortia for the Chinese semiconductor industry that accounted for 14.1% of our revenue; JiangYin ChangDian Advanced Packaging Co. Ltd., a leading PRC foundry that accounted for 12.8% of our revenue; and Yangtze Memory Technologies Co., Ltd., a leading PRC memory chip company that, together with one of its subsidiaries, accounted for 10.2% of our revenue. In 2016 99.3% of our revenue was derived from four customers: Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation, which accounted for 33.7% of our revenue; Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, a leading PRC foundry that accounted for 25.0% of our revenue; SK Hynix Inc., which accounted for 24.0% of our revenue; and JiangYin ChangDian Advanced Packaging Co. Ltd., a leading PRC foundry that accounted for 16.6% of our revenue. Table of Contents Based on our market experience, we believe that implementation of our equipment by one of our selected leading companies will attract and encourage other manufacturers to evaluate our equipment, because the leading company's implementation will serve as validation of our equipment and will enable the other manufacturers to shorten their evaluation processes. We placed our first SAPS-based tool in 2009 as a prototype. We worked closely with the customer for two years in debugging and modifying the tool, and the customer then spent two more years of qualification and running pilot production before beginning volume manufacturing. We expect that the period from new product introduction to high volume manufacturing will be three years or less in the future. Please see ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Business-We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. There are also a limited number of potential customers for our products."" All of our sales in 2016 and 2017 were to customers located in Asia, and we anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to come from customers located in this region for the near future. We have increased our sales efforts to penetrate the markets in North America and Western Europe. We utilize the guidance set forth in the FASB's ASC Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, regarding the recognition, presentation and disclosure of revenue in our financial statements. We recognize revenue when: persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; delivery has occurred and the major risks and remunerations of ownership have been transferred to the customer; collectability is probable; and the selling price is fixed or determinable, as described below under ""-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates-Revenue Recognition."" We offer extended maintenance service contracts to provide services such as trouble-shooting or fine-tuning tools, and installing spare parts, following expiration of applicable initial warranty coverage periods, which for sales to date have extended from 12 to 36 months as described under ""-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates-Warranty."" A limited number of the single-wafer wet cleaning tools we have sold to date are no longer covered by their initial warranties. In 2016 and 2017, we received payments for parts and labor for service activities provided from time to time, but as of December 31, 2017 we had not yet entered into extended maintenance service contracts with respect to any of the tools for which initial warranty coverage had expired. We expect to enter into extended maintenance service contracts with customers as additional initial warranties expire, but we do not expect revenue from extended maintenance service contracts to represent a material portion of our revenue in the future. The loss or delay of one or more large sale transactions in a quarter could impact our results of operations for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is lost or delayed, as described under ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-Our quarterly operating results can be difficult to predict and can fluctuate substantially, which could result in volatility in the price of Class A common stock."" It is difficult to predict accurately when, or even if, we can complete a sale of a tool to a potential customer or to increase sales to any existing customer. Our tool demand forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, including non-binding forecasts received from customers years in advance, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. Difficulties in forecasting demand for our tools make it difficult for us to project future operating results and may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excess spending on inventory or on tools that may not be purchased, as further described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-Difficulties in forecasting demand for our tools may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excess spending on inventory items that may not be used."" Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue for capital equipment consists primarily of: ? ? ? ? ? ? We are not party to any long-term purchasing agreements with suppliers. Please see ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-Our customers do not enter into long-term purchase commitments, and they may decrease, cancel or delay their projected purchases at any time."" As our customer base and tool installations continue to grow, we will need to hire additional manufacturing personnel. The rates at which we add customers and install tools will affect the level and time of this spending. In addition, because we often import components and spare parts from the United States, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, the effect of the dollar's growth on our cost of revenue. Table of Contents Gross Margin Our gross margin was 47.2% in 2017 and 48.7% in 2016. Gross margin may vary from period to period, primarily related to the level of utilization and the timing and mix of purchase orders. We expect gross margin to be between 40% and 45% for the foreseeable future, with direct manufacturing costs approximating 50% to 55% of revenue and overhead costs totaling approximately 5% of revenue. The higher margin in 2016 and 2017 were primarily due to two systems manufactured under governmental subsidies (see ""-PRC Government Research and Development Funding"" below), which were sold for $1.8 million and $3.7 million in 2016. Costs associated with these systems were recorded as research and development expenses as these systems were research and development in nature and had not reached the final product manufacture stage. The related research and development expense was recorded as reduction of our research and development expense as incurred. We seek to maintain our gross margin by continuing to develop proprietary technologies that avoid pricing pressure for our wet cleaning equipment. We actively manage our operations through principles of operational excellence designed to ensure continuing improvement in the efficiency and quality of our manufacturing operations by, for example, implementing factory constraint management and change control and inventory management systems. In addition, our purchasing department actively seeks to identify and negotiate supply contracts with improved pricing to reduce cost of revenue. A significant portion of our raw materials are denominated in Renminbi, or RMB, while the majority of our purchase orders are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, currency exchange rates may have a significant effect on our gross margin. For further information, please see ""Exchange Rate Information."" Operating Expenses We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, growth in the dollar amount of our operating expenses, as we make investments to support the anticipated growth of our customer base and the continued development of proprietary technologies. As we continue to grow our business, we expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense accounted for 15.1% of our revenue in 2017 and 14.3% of our revenue in 2016. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of: ? ? ? ? ? ? ? Sales and marketing expense can be significant and may fluctuate, in part because of the resource-intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and variability of our sales cycle. The length of our sales cycle, from initial contact with a customer to the execution of a purchase order, is generally 6 to 24 months. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities, including educating customers about our tools, participating in extended tool evaluations and configuring our tools to customer-specific needs. Sales and marketing expense in a given period can be particularly affected by the increase in travel and entertainment expenses associated with the finalization of purchase orders or the installation of tools. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars, as we continue to invest in sales and marketing by hiring additional employees and expanding marketing programs in existing or new markets. We must invest in sales and marketing processes in order to develop and maintain close relationships with customers. We are making dollar-based . . .

ACMR,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report and our final prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 3, 2017 pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act of 1933. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this report, particularly in the section titled ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in Part II. In this discussion, we use financial measures that are considered non-GAAP financial measures under Securities and Exchange Commission rules. These rules require supplemental explanation and reconciliation, which is included elsewhere in this report. Investors should not consider non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from or in substitution for, financial information presented in compliance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. Overview We develop, manufacture and sell single-wafer wet cleaning equipment, which semiconductor manufacturers can use in numerous manufacturing steps to remove particles, contaminants and other random defects, and thereby improve product yield, in fabricating advanced integrated circuits, or chips. Our Ultra C equipment is designed to remove random defects from a wafer surface effectively, without damaging a wafer or its features, even at an increasingly advanced process node (the minimum line width on a chip) of 22 nanometers, or nm, or less. Our equipment is based on our innovative, proprietary Space Alternated Phase Shift, or SAPS, and Timely Energized Bubble Oscillation, or TEBO, technologies. We developed our proprietary technologies to enable manufacturers to produce chips that reach their ultimate physical limitations while maintaining product yield, which is the percentage of chips on a wafer that meet manufacturing specifications In November 2017 we issued and sold 2,233,000 shares of Class A common stock in our initial public offering, or IPO. Of the shares sold in the IPO, 2,000,000 were sold upon completion of the IPO on November 7, 2017 and 233,000 shares were sold on November 14, 2017 upon exercise of an over-allotment option granted to the underwriters of the IPO. In addition, on November 7, 2017, following the completion of the IPO, we issued and sold 1,333,334 shares of Class A common stock in a private placement to two investors, which we refer to as the concurrent private placement. All of the 3,566,334 shares of Class A common stock issued in the IPO and the concurrent private placement were sold at a price of $5.60 per share, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20.0 million. We received $16.5 million in net proceeds from the IPO and the concurrent private placement, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, placement fees, and offering costs. Minority Interests in Our Operating Company We conduct our business operations principally through ACM Shanghai, a subsidiary of ACM Research. Until August 31, 2017 ACM Research owned 62.87% of the outstanding equity interests in ACM Shanghai. Three third-party investors based in the People's Republic of China, or PRC, held the remaining 37.13% of the ACM Shanghai equity interests, which are reflected as ""non-controlling interests"" in our consolidated balance sheets. On August 31, 2017 we acquired an additional 18.77% of the ACM equity interests, increasing our ownership of ACM equity interests to 81.64%. On that date, Shanghai Science and Technology Venture Capital Co., Ltd. contemporaneously sold to ACM Research, for an aggregate price of $6.2 million, its 18.77% equity interests in ACM Shanghai and purchased from ACM Research, for an aggregate price of $5.8 million, shares of Series E preferred stock that converted, upon completion of the IPO, into 1,666,170 shares of Class A common stock, for an effective purchase price of $3.48 per share. Under PRC regulations, each of the two remaining minority investors could sell its ACM Shanghai equity interests only by means of an auction process. In September 2017 each of the two minority investors commenced an auction process for the sale of its ACM Shanghai equity interests and, pursuant to securities purchase agreements entered into by ACM Research and each of the minority investors in August 2017, ACM Research submitted auction bids for the ACM Shanghai equity interests held by the two minority investors. In October 2017 ACM Table of Contents Research was advised that its bids for the minority ACM Shanghai equity interests had won both auctions and that the sales of the minority interests would be completed by no later than December 31, 2017: Shanghai Pudong High-Tech Investment Co., Ltd. will sell 10.78% of the ACM Shanghai equity interests to ACM Research for an aggregate price of $8.4 million. Its subsidiary Pudong Science and Technology (Cayman) Co., Ltd., pursuant to one of the August 2017 securities purchase agreements, had purchased from ACM Research on September 8, 2017 a total of 1,119,576 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $7.50 per share, representing an aggregate price of $8.4 million. Shanghai Zhangjiang Science & Technology Venture Capital Co., Ltd. will sell 7.58% of the ACM Shanghai equity interests to ACM Research for an aggregate price of $5.9 million. Its subsidiary Zhangjiang AJ Company Limited, pursuant to an August 2017 securities purchase agreement, purchased from ACM Research on September 8, 2017 a total of 787,098 shares of Class A common stock at a price of $7.50 per share, representing an aggregate price of $5.9 million. Upon completion of the two auction processes in the fourth quarter of 2017, ACM will own all of the outstanding equity interests of ACM Shanghai. Key Components of Results of Operations Revenue We develop, manufacture and sell single-wafer wet cleaning equipment and custom-made wafer assembly and packaging equipment. Because we currently sell our capital equipment, or tools, to a small number of customers and we customize those tools to fulfill the customers' specific requirements, our revenue generation fluctuates, depending on the length of the sales, development and evaluation phases: Sales and Development. During the sale process we may, depending on a prospective customer's specifications and requirements, need to perform additional research, development and testing to establish that a tool can meet the prospective customer's requirements. We then host an in-housedemonstration of the customized tool prototype. Sales cycles for orders that require limited customization and do not require that we develop new technology usually take from 6 to 12 months, while the product life cycle, including the initial design, demonstration and final assembly phases, for orders requiring development and testing of new technologies can take as long as 2 to 4 years. As we expand our customer base, we expect to gain more repeat purchase orders for tools that we have already developed and tested, which will eliminate the need for a demonstration phase and shorten the development cycle. Evaluation Periods. When a chip manufacturer proposes to purchase a particular type of tool from us for the first time, we offer the manufacturer an opportunity to evaluate the tool for a period that can extend for 24 months or longer. We do not receive any payment on first-time purchases until the tool is accepted. As a result, we may spend between $1.0 and $2.0 million to produce a tool without receiving payment for more than 24 months or, if the tool is not accepted, without receiving any payment. Please see ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-We may incur significant expenses long before we can recognize revenue from new products, if at all, due to the costs and length of research, development, manufacturing and customer evaluation process cycles"" in Part II below. Purchase Orders. In accordance with industry practice, sales of our tools are made pursuant to purchase orders. Each purchase order from a customer for one of our tools contains specific technical requirements intended to ensure, among other things, that the tool will be compatible with the customer's manufacturing process line. Until a purchase order is received, we do not have a binding purchase commitment. Our SAPS and TEBO customers to date have provided us with non-binding one- to two-year forecasts of their anticipated demands, and we expect future customers to furnish similar non-binding forecasts for planning purposes. Any of those forecasts would be subject to change, however, by the customer at any time, without notice to us. Fulfillment. We seek to obtain a purchase order for a tool from three to four months in advance of the expected delivery date. Depending upon the nature of a customer's specifications, the lead time for production of a tool generally will extend from two to four months. The lead-time can be as long as six months, however, and in some cases we may need to begin producing a tool based on a customer's non-binding forecast, rather than waiting to receive a binding purchase order. Table of Contents We expect our sales prices generally to range between $2.5 million and $5.0 million for SAPS tools and between $3.5 million and $6.5 million for TEBO tools. The sales price of a particular tool will vary depending upon the required specifications. We have designed equipment models using a modular configuration that we customize to meet customers' technical specifications. For example, our Ultra C models for SAPS and TEBO solutions use modular configurations that enable us to create a wet-cleaning tool meeting a customer's specific requirements, while using pre-existing designs for chamber, electrical, chemical delivery and other modules. Because of the relatively large purchase prices of our tools, customers generally pay in installments. For a customer's repeat purchase of a particular type of tool, the specific payment terms are negotiated in connection with acceptance of a purchase order. Based on our limited experience with repeat sales of SAPS and TEBO tools, we expect that we will receive an initial payment upon delivery of a tool in connection with a repeat purchase, with the balance being paid once the tool has been tested and accepted by the customer. Our sales arrangements for repeat purchases do not include a general right of return. Since introducing SAPS technology in 2009, we have focused on selling SAPS-based tools and, beginning in 2016, TEBO-based tools. Our revenue from sales of single-wafer wet cleaning equipment totaled $14.8 million, or 76.8% of our revenue, in the nine months of 2017 (compared with $5.8 million, or 44.6% of revenue, in the first nine months of 2016), $21.5 million, or 78.4% of our revenue, in 2016 and $26.8 million, or 86.0% of our revenue, in 2015. We have generated most of our revenue from a limited number of customers as the result of our strategy of initially placing SAPS- and TEBO-based equipment with a small number of leading chip manufacturers that are driving technology trends and key capability implementation. In 2016 99.3% of our revenue was derived from four customers: Shanghai Huali Microelectronics Corporation, which accounted for 33.7% of our revenue; Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, a leading PRC foundry that accounted for 25.0% of our revenue; SK Hynix Inc., which accounted for 24.0% of our revenue; and JiangYin ChangDian Advanced Packaging Co. Ltd., a leading PRC foundry that accounted for 16.6% of our revenue. In 2015 all of our revenue was derived from three customers, including SK Hynix Inc., which accounted for 86.0% of our revenue, and JiangYin ChangDian Advanced Packaging Co., Ltd., which accounted for 10.1% of our revenue. Based on our market experience, we believe that implementation of our equipment by one of our selected leading companies will attract and encourage other manufacturers to evaluate our equipment, because the leading company's implementation will serve as validation of our equipment and will enable the other manufacturers to shorten their evaluation processes. We placed our first SAPS-based tool in 2009 as a prototype. We worked closely with the customer for two years in debugging and modifying the tool, and the customer then spent two more years of qualification and running pilot production before beginning volume manufacturing. Our revenue in 2015 included sales of SAPS-based tools following the customer's completion of its qualification process. We expect that the period from new product introduction to high volume manufacturing will be three years or less in the future. Please see ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Business-We depend on a small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenue, and the loss of, or a significant reduction in orders from, one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and operating results. There are also a limited number of potential customers for our products"" in Part II below. All of our sales in 2015, 2016 and the first nine months of 2017 were to customers located in Asia, and we anticipate that a substantial majority of our revenue will continue to come from customers located in this region for the near future. We have increased our sales efforts to penetrate the markets in North America and Western Europe. We recognize revenue in accordance with the Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 605, Revenue Recognition, of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, as described below under ""-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates-Revenue Recognition."" We offer extended maintenance service contracts to provide services such as trouble-shooting or fine-tuning tools, and installing spare parts, following expiration of applicable initial warranty coverage periods, which for sales to date have extended from 12 to 36 months as described under ""-Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Judgments and Estimates-Warranty."" A limited number of the single-wafer wet cleaning tools we have sold to date are no longer covered by their initial warranties. In 2015, 2016 and the first nine months of 2017, we received payments for parts and labor for service activities provided from time to time, but as of September 30, 2017 we had Table of Contents not yet entered into extended maintenance service contracts with respect to any of the tools for which initial warranty coverage had expired. We expect to enter into extended maintenance service contracts with customers as additional initial warranties expire, but we do not expect revenue from extended maintenance service contracts to represent a material portion of our revenue in the future. The loss or delay of one or more large sale transactions in a quarter could impact our results of operations for that quarter and any future quarters for which revenue from that transaction is lost or delayed, as described under ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-Our quarterly operating results can be difficult to predict and can fluctuate substantially, which could result in volatility in the price of Class A common stock"" in Part II below. It is difficult to predict accurately when, or even if, we can complete a sale of a tool to a potential customer or to increase sales to any existing customer. Our tool demand forecasts are based on multiple assumptions, including non-binding forecasts received from customers years in advance, each of which may introduce error into our estimates. Difficulties in forecasting demand for our tools make it difficult for us to project future operating results and may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excess spending on inventory or on tools that may not be purchased, as further described in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-Difficulties in forecasting demand for our tools may lead to periodic inventory shortages or excess spending on inventory items that may not be used"" in Part II below. Cost of Revenue Cost of revenue for capital equipment consists primarily of: direct costs, which consist principally of costs of tool components and subassemblies purchased from third-party vendors; compensation of personnel associated with our manufacturing operations, including stock-based compensation (""SBC""); depreciation of manufacturing equipment; amortization of costs of software used for manufacturing purposes; other expenses attributable to our manufacturing department; and allocated overhead for rent and utilities. We are not party to any long-term purchasing agreements with suppliers. Please see ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business and Our Industry-Our customers do not enter into long-term purchase commitments, and they may decrease, cancel or delay their projected purchases at any time"" in Part II below. As our customer base and tool installations continue to grow, we will need to hire additional manufacturing personnel. The rates at which we add customers and install tools will affect the level and time of this spending. In addition, because we often import components and spare parts from the United States, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, the effect of the dollar's growth on our cost of revenue. Gross Margin Our gross margin was 41.7% in the first nine months of 2017 (compared with 44.1% in the first nine months of 2016), 48.7% in 2016 and 45.3% in 2015. Gross margin may vary from period to period, primarily related to the level of utilization and the timing and mix of purchase orders. We expect gross margin to be between 40% and 45% for the foreseeable future, with direct manufacturing costs approximating 50% to 55% of revenue and overhead costs totaling approximately 5% of revenue. We seek to maintain our gross margin by continuing to develop proprietary technologies that avoid pricing pressure for our wet cleaning equipment. We actively manage our operations through principles of operational excellence designed to ensure continuing improvement in the efficiency and quality of our manufacturing operations by, for example, implementing factory constraint management and change control and inventory management systems. In addition, our purchasing department actively seeks to identify and negotiate supply contracts with improved pricing to reduce cost of revenue. Table of Contents A significant portion of our raw materials are denominated in Renminbi, or RMB, while the majority of our purchase orders are denominated in U.S. dollars. As a result, currency exchange rates may have a significant effect on our gross margin. For further information, please see ""Exchange Rate Information."" Operating Expenses We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, growth in the dollar amount of our operating expenses, as we make investments to support the anticipated growth of our customer base and the continued development of proprietary technologies. As we continue to grow our business, we expect operating expenses to increase in absolute dollars. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expense accounted for 18.7% of our revenue in the first nine months of 2017 (compared with 19.4% of revenue in the first nine months of 2016), 14.3% of our revenue in 2016 and 13.5% of our revenue in 2015. Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of: compensation of personnel associated with pre- and after-sales support and other sales and marketing activities, including stock-based compensation; sales commissions paid to independent sales representatives; fees paid to sales consultants; shipping and handling costs for transportation of products to customers; warranty costs; cost of trade shows; travel and entertainment; and allocated overhead for rent and utilities. Sales and marketing expense can be significant and may fluctuate, in part because of the resource-intensive nature of our sales efforts and the length and variability of our sales cycle. The length of our sales cycle, from initial contact with a customer to the execution of a purchase order, is generally 6 to 24 months. During the sales cycle, we expend significant time and money on sales and marketing activities, including educating customers about our tools, participating in extended tool evaluations and configuring our tools to customer-specific needs. Sales and marketing expense in a given period can be particularly affected by the increase in travel and entertainment expenses associated with the finalization of purchase orders or the installation of tools. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, sales and marketing expense will increase in absolute dollars, as we continue to invest in sales and marketing by hiring additional employees and expanding marketing programs in existing or new markets. We must invest in sales and marketing processes in order to develop and maintain close relationships with customers. We are making dollar-based investments in dollars in order to support growth of our customer base in the United States, and the relative strength of the dollar could have a significant effect on our sales and marketing expense. Research and Development Research and development expense accounted for 15.9% of our revenue in the first nine months of 2017 (compared with 17.7% of revenue in the first nine months of 2016), 11.9% of our revenue in 2016 and 9.4% of our revenue in 2015. Research and development expense relates to the development of new products and processes and encompasses our research, development and customer support activities. Research and development expense consists primarily of: Table of Contents costs of components and other research and development supplies; travel expense associated with customer support; amortization of costs of software used for research and development purposes; and allocated overhead for rent and utilities. Some of our research and development has been funded by grants from the PRC government, as described in ""-PRC Government Research and Development Funding"" below. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, research and development expense will increase in absolute dollars and will range between 10% and 12% of revenue, as we continue to invest in research and development to advance our technologies. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to support and enhance our existing single-wafer wet cleaning products and to develop future product offerings to build and maintain our technology leadership position. General and Administrative General and administrative expense accounted for 22.9% of our revenue in the first nine months of 2017 (compared with 13.0% of revenue in the first nine months of 2016), 9.8% of our revenue in 2016 and 6.7% of our revenue in 2015. General and administrative expense consists primarily of: compensation of executive, accounting and finance, human resources, information technology, and other administrative personnel, including stock-based compensation; professional fees, including accounting and legal fees; other corporate expenses; and allocated overhead for rent and utilities. We expect that, for the foreseeable future, general and administrative expense will increase in absolute dollars, as we incur additional costs associated with growing our business and operating as a public company. Stock-Based Compensation Expense We grant stock options to employees and non-employee consultants and directors, and we accounts for those stock-based awards in accordance with the FASB's ASC Topic 718, Compensation-Stock Compensation and ASC Subtopic 505-50, Equity-Based Payments to Non-Employees. Stock-based awards granted to employees are measured at the fair value of the awards on the grant date and are recognized as expenses either Stock-based awards granted to non-employees are accounted for at the fair value of the awards at the earlier of (a) the date at which a commitment for performance by the non-employee to earn the awards is reached and Table of Contents Cost of revenue and operating expenses during the periods presented below have included stock-based compensation as follows:  Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Stock-Based Compensation Expense: Cost of revenue $ 5 $ 3 $ 15 $ 8 Sales and marketing expense 17 1 35 4 Research and development expense 13 1 38 4 General and administrative expense 308 (5 ) 1,604 177 Total stock-based compensation expense $ 343 $ 0 $ 1,692 $ 193  We recognized stock-based compensation expense to employees of $72,000 in the third quarter of 2017 (compared to $23,000 in the third quarter of 2016), $200,000 in the first nine months of 2017 (compared to $68,000 in the first nine months of 2016), $92,000 in 2016 and $73,000 in 2015. As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 and 2015, there was $712,000, $726,000 and $299,000 of total unrecognized employee share-based compensation expense, net of estimated forfeitures, related to unvested share-based awards, which are expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.92 years, 2.25 years and 1.24 years, respectively. We recognized stock-based compensation expense to non-employees of $272,000 in the third quarter of 2017 (compared to ($23,000) in the third quarter of 2016), $1.5 million in the first nine months of 2017 (compared to $125,000 in the first nine months of 2016), $291,000 in 2016 and $350,000 in 2015.

(2) Non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation. Revenue. Revenue in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 19.9% from the comparable quarter in 2016 to $17.2 million. The increase was due to greater sales of single-wafer cleaning equipment and from the first sale of copper plating equipment. Revenue for fiscal year 2017 totaled $36.5 million, an increase of 33.4% from fiscal year 2016, due largely to a higher volume of shipments of single-wafer cleaning equipment.  Gross Margin. Gross margins of 53.4% and 47.2%, respectively, in the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017 were above the range of 40.0% to 45.0% generally anticipated by the Company for the foreseeable future. Gross margin may vary from period to period, primarily related to the level of utilization and the timing and mix of purchase orders. The strong gross margin performance in the fourth quarter of 2017 was due to the sale of the first copper plating equipment, which was manufactured under PRC governmental subsidies.  Operating Expenses. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 were $5.4 million, up from $3.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Operating expenses in fiscal year 2017 totaled $16.5 million, compared to $9.8 million in fiscal 2016. The increases in operating expenses in the fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 were due to higher R&D spending, sales and marketing expenses, the cost of preparing for the Company's initial public offering (""IPO""), and an increase in stock-based compensation.  Net Income (Loss) attributable to ACM Research. Net income in the fourth quarter 2017 was $3.4 million, up from $1.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Net loss for fiscal year 2017 was $0.3 million, compared to net income of $1.0 million in fiscal year 2016. Net loss in 2017 reflected increased spending on research and development and customer support, as well as expenses associated with preparation for the IPO as well as an increase in stock-based compensation.  Cash and Capital Stock. In November 2017 ACM Research sold 2,233,000 shares of Class A common stock in its initial public offering and an additional 1,333,334 shares in a concurrent private placement, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20.0 million. The Company held $17.7 million in cash as of December 31, 2017. 2018 Revenue Outlook For fiscal year 2018, the Company expects revenue to be approximately $65 million. Conference Call Details A conference call to discuss fourth quarter and fiscal year 2017 results will be held today at 8:00 a.m. U.S Eastern Time (9:00 p.m. China Time).

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ACM Research presents non-GAAP gross margin, operating income and net income (loss) as supplemental measures to GAAP financial measures regarding ACM Research's operational performance. These supplemental measures exclude the impact of stock-based compensation, which ACM Research does not believe is indicative of its core operating results. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below under ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures."" ACM Research believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in assessing its operating performance. ACM Research uses these financial measures internally to evaluate its operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Financial analysts may focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on the non-GAAP financial measures. ACM Research also believes it is in the best interests of investors for ACM Research to provide this non-GAAP information. While ACM Research believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be reported by competitors, and they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in calculation methodologies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP information and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures. They should be used only as a supplement to GAAP information and should be considered only in conjunction with ACM Research's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Forward-Looking Statements Information presented above under ""Financial Summary--Gross Margin"" with respect to the expected range of gross margin for the foreseeable future and under ""Fiscal 2018 Revenue Outlook"" contains forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may vary significantly from ACM Research's expectations based on a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the following: anticipated customer orders or identified market opportunities may not grow or develop as anticipated; customer orders already received may be postponed or canceled; suppliers may not be able to meet ACM Research's demands on a timely basis; volatile global economic, market, industry and other conditions could result in sharply lower demand for products containing semiconductors and for the company's products and in disruption of capital and credit markets; ACM Research's failure to successfully manage its operations; and trade regulations, currency fluctuations, political instability and war may materially adversely affect ACM Research due to its substantial non-U.S. customer and supplier base and its substantial non-U.S. manufacturing operations. ACM Research cannot guarantee any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. ACM Research expressly disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements after the date of this press release. About ACM Research, Inc.

(2) Non-GAAP financial measures exclude stock-based compensation. Revenue. Revenue in the third quarter of 2017 was essentially flat with the prior year period, reflecting a decrease in revenue from advanced packaging equipment that was substantially offset by an increase in revenue from single-wafer cleaning equipment. Revenue in the first nine months of 2017 increased 48.3% from the first nine months of 2016, due to a higher volume of shipments of single-wafer cleaning equipment during the first half of 2017.  Gross Margin. Gross margins of 45.0% and 41.7%, respectively, in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were within the range of 40.0% to 45.0% generally anticipated by the company for the foreseeable future. Gross margin may vary from period to period, primarily related to the level of utilization and the timing and mix of purchase orders. The strong gross margin performance in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 was due to the sale of one higher--margin single-wafer wet cleaning equipment tool.  Net Income (Loss). Net losses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 reflected increased spending on research and development and customer support, as well as expenses associated with preparation for the company's initial public offering.  Non-controlling Interests. In the third quarter of 2017 ACM acquired 18.77% of the outstanding equity interest in ACM's operating company ACM Research (Shanghai), Inc., increasing ACM's holdings to a total of 81.64% of the operating company's equity interests. Subsequent to quarter end, ACM closed the commitment to acquire the remaining 18.36% of the operating company's equity interests.  Cash and Capital Stock. In November 2017 ACM sold 2,233,000 shares of Class A common stock in its initial public offering and an additional 1,333,334 shares in a concurrent private placement, for aggregate gross proceeds of $20.0 million. The company held $20.3 million in cash as of December 1, 2017. The stock offerings, including the automatic conversion of ACM's convertible preferred stock upon completion of the initial public offering, will be reflected in ACM's financial statements for the fourth quarter of 2017. Fourth Quarter 2017 Revenue Outlook For the fourth quarter of 2017, the company expects revenue to be in the range of $11 million to $12 million.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ACM presents non-GAAP gross margin, operating income (loss) and net income (loss) as supplemental measures to GAAP financial measures regarding ACM's operational performance. These supplemental measures exclude the impact of stock-based compensation, which ACM does not believe is indicative of its core operating results. A reconciliation of each non-GAAP financial measure to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measure is provided below under ""Reconciliation of Non-GAAP to GAAP Financial Measures."" ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors in assessing its operating performance. ACM uses these financial measures internally to evaluate its operating performance and for planning and forecasting of future periods. Financial analysts may focus on and publish both historical results and future projections based on the non-GAAP financial measures. ACM also believes it is in the best interests of investors for ACM to provide this non-GAAP information. While ACM believes these non-GAAP financial measures provide useful supplemental information to investors, there are limitations associated with the use of these non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures may not be reported by competitors, and they may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies due to differences in calculation methodologies. The non-GAAP financial measures are not an alternative to GAAP information and are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP financial measures. They should be used only as a supplement to GAAP information and should be considered only in conjunction with ACM's consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP. Forward-Looking Statements Information presented in the second paragraph of this press release and under ""Financial Summary--Gross Margin"" above with respect to the expected range of gross margin for the foreseeable future contains forward-looking statements for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Actual results may vary significantly from ACM's expectations based on a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to the following: anticipated customer orders or identified market opportunities may not grow or develop as anticipated; customer orders already received may be postponed or canceled; suppliers may not be able to meet ACM's demands on a timely basis; volatile global economic, market, industry and other conditions could result in sharply lower demand for products containing semiconductors and for the company's products and in disruption of capital and credit markets; ACM's failure to successfully manage its operations; and trade regulations, currency fluctuations, political instability and war may materially adversely affect ACM due to its substantial non-U.S. customer and supplier base and its substantial non-U.S. manufacturing operations. ACM cannot guarantee any future results, levels of activity, performance or achievements. ACM expressly disclaims any obligation to update forward-looking statements after the date of this press release. About ACM Research, Inc.

ACMR,"Nov 10, 2017 (NetworkNewsWire via COMTEX) -- Zinc One Resources Inc.'s (tsx.v:Z) ZZZOF, -1.61% (RH33) past-producing Bongara Zinc-Oxide Mine Project in Peru spans an area of more than 19,768 acres. The company intends to bring Bongara back into production as world stockpiles of zinc are at multi-year lows. An article discussing this reads: ""Zinc One's objective is to delineate and update the historical resource and then be aggressive in taking the next steps to move the company into a producer generating cash flow. The company is extremely confident that it can match or exceed the historical resource at the Bongara Mine Project. The Company will have years of exploration along a six-kilometer strike length on the Bongara concessions, as well as the prospective Charlotte Bongara concessions. The company anticipates a completed updated resource estimate by Q2 of 2018 with a target of between 1.2 million and 2 million tons of zinc at 20 percent grade followed in short order by a Preliminary Economic Assessment."" To view the full press release, visit: http://nnw.fm/ej4Cx About Zinc One Resources, Inc. Zinc One is focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of prospective and advanced zinc projects in mining-friendly jurisdictions. Zinc One's key assets are the Bongara Mine and Charlotte-Bongara Zinc-Oxide Projects in north-central Peru. The Bongara Zinc-Oxide Mine Project was in production from 2007 to 2008, but shut down due to the global financial crisis and concurrent decrease in the zinc price. Past production included 20% zinc grades and recoveries over 90% from surface and near-surface nonsulfide zinc mineralization. High-grade nonsulfide zinc mineralization is known to outcrop between the mined area and the Charlotte-Bongara Zinc-Oxide Project, which is nearly six kilometers to the north-northwest and where past drilling intercepted various near-surface zones with high-grade zinc. Zinc One is managed by a proven team of exploration geologists and engineers who have previously constructed and operated successful mining operations.
