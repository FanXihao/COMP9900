ODC,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Among the stocks that could see active trade in Friday’s session are American International Group Inc., AAR Corp. and Royal Gold Inc. TimeAmerican International Group Inc.May 15Jan 16Sep 16May 17Jan 18 US:AIG $50 $55 $60 $65 Marking another milestone, AIG AIG, -2.77%  said it’s now reduced U.S. government-authorized support in the company by more than $152 billion as a result of the repayment of the Federal Reserve’s so-called Maiden Lane III LLC loan. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York recently completed auctions of Maiden Lane III assets, meaning AIG has fully repaid the non-recourse loan using cash flows from interest and principal payments as well as liquidation of assets. The New York-based company, which received billions in federal support at the height of the 2008-2009 financial crisis, noted the Fed earned nearly $3 billion from the previous sale of the Maiden Lane II portfolio and said the central bank “could earn as much” when the Maiden Lane III portfolio has been fully liquidated. The U.S. Treasury still owns about $30 billion in AIG common stock as the government’s remaining investment. Maximum support for AIG authorized by the government reached $182 billion in 2008, of which $21 billion was unused or expired, the company said. TimeAAR Corp.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:AIR $35 $40 $45 AAR AIR, -3.31%  isn’t scheduled to formally report until July 17 its financial results for the fourth quarter ended May 31, but the Wood Dale, Ill.-based company disclosed preliminary results late Thursday — including the highest quarterly sales in company history — and set forth its outlook for fiscal 2013. Net earnings for the May quarter are pegged at 30 cents to 32 cents a share, with profit on an adjusted basis seen in a range of 44 cents and 46 cents a share. Quarterly sales are expected to range between $560 million and $565 million. Special charges taken against results for the latest quarter are expected to total about $13.5 million, AAR said. For fiscal 2013, the company projected earnings of $1.55 to $1.65 a share on consolidated sales of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion. Separately, AAR’s board authorized the company to buy back up to $50 million in common stock. Repurchases will be made from time to time in open-market or private transactions using available cash and cash generated from operations, the company said. The new authorization replaces a stock-buyback program in effect since 2006. TimeRoyal Gold Inc.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:RGLD $70 $80 $90 Also late Thursday, Royal Gold RGLD, +1.79%  priced a $325 million public offering of convertible senior notes. The offering of the 7-year notes is scheduled to close June 20, the Denver-based company said. Royal Gold granted underwriters a 30-day option to buy up to an additional $45 million of the notes if needed to satisfy investor demand. Net proceeds will be used to pay down and terminate Royal Gold’s term-loan facility as well as for general corporate purposes, including future acquisitions. The notes will pay interest twice a year, at a rate of 2.875%, starting Dec. 15. Effective March 15, 2019, or earlier if certain events take place, the notes can be converted into Royal Gold common stock at an initial rate of 9.4955 shares per $1,000 principal amount. The initial conversion price of about $105.31 a share represents a 35% premium over the closing price on Royal Gold’s Nasdaq-listed common stock on Thursday. Royal Gold said it may redeem some or all of the notes for cash under certain circumstances on or after June 15, 2015. TimeOil-Dri Corp. of AmericaMay 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:ODC $35 $40 $45 $50 The board of Oil-Dri Corp. of America ODC, -2.91%  authorized the further repurchase of common stock. An additional 250,000 shares can be repurchased, on top of 89,229 shares still available under previous authorizations, the company said. Oil-Dri said it’s bought back 277,648 shares during the fiscal year ending in July, at an average price of $21.08 each. The company had more than 7.1 million average shares outstanding on a diluted basis in the third quarter ended April 30. Chicago-based Oil-Dri’s board also declared a quarterly cash dividend on common stock of 18 cents a share, representing an increase of nearly 6%.

It’s payable Oct. 15 to holders of record as of Sept. 17, the Detroit-based company said. MicroVision Inc. MVIS, -8.41%  said it would make a secondary public offering of common shares and warrants to purchase common stock. Net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, according to the Redmond, Wash.-based company. Oppenheimer & Co. has been designated underwriter. The move comes as MicroVision said that it’s regained compliance with Nasdaq listing rules and that its stock will continue to trade on the Nasdaq Global Market. Wabtec Corp. WAB, -2.14%  said it paid about $88 million to acquire Mors Smitt Holding, a manufacturer of electronic components for rail and industrial markets that has annual sales of about $60 million. The deal’s expected to contribute to earnings in its first year, Wilmerding, Pa.-based Wabtec said. With about 350 employees, Mors Smitt has operations in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, the U.S., France, China and Hong Kong.

ODC,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Among the stocks that could see active trade in Wednesday’s session are TE Connectivity Ltd., Chevron Corp. and PepsiCo Inc. Besides PepsiCo, companies on Wednesday’s earnings calendar include Adtran Inc. ADTN, -1.77% Host Hotels & Resorts Inc. HST, -1.56% Oil-Dri Corp. of America ODC, -3.01% Bank of the Ozarks Inc. OZRK, -3.31% and Art’s Way Manufacturing Co. ARTW, +6.25% among others. The consensus of analysts surveyed by FactSet Research is for Purchase, N.Y.-based PepsiCo PEP, -1.91%  to post a third-quarter profit of 1.30 a share on revenue of $17.11 billion. Late Tuesday, Standard & Poor’s said TE Connectivity TEL, -3.39%  will become part of the S&P 500 Index SPX, -2.76%  after the close of trading on Oct. 14. It will replace Cephalon Inc.

Chevron CVX, -2.74% part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, said earnings for the third quarter “are expected to be comparable” with what the energy company generated during the second quarter. In its interim update late Tuesday, San Ramon, Calif.-based Chevron pointed to weaker crude-oil realizations as well as lower liftings as factors behind reduce earnings anticipated from its upstream operations. Downstream earnings are expected to be higher, largely reflecting an asset sale gain, and both operating segments are expected to benefit from currency transactions as a result of strengthening in the U.S. dollar in the third quarter. Chevron’s quarterly results are scheduled for Oct. 28. Along with reporting third-quarter results, Neustar Inc. NSR, -1.26%  raised its full-year financial forecast, announced the repurchase of up to $250 million in Class A common shares on an accelerated basis and said it would make acquisition. As revised, the company now sees revenue in a range of $595 million to $600 million, with earnings from continuing operations pegged at $1.76 to $1.84 a share. Sterling, Va.-based Neustar also said it’s entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Targus Information Corp. for about $650 million in cash. IDT Corp.

ODC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Small companies are often overlooked, unappreciated and hard to understand. That's just how Eric Cinnamond likes them. ""Small-cap companies are really unique,"" said the manager of Intrepid Small Cap Fund ICMAX, -0.22% ""Companies like this don't move with the market."" Going against the herd was the driving force behind the three stocks Cinnamond recommended in a late April interview for MarketWatch's column ""The Stockpickers."" See full story. Over a treacherous 13-week stretch that challenged investors' patience and rattled their confidence, the stocks Cinnamond chose were notable standouts, gaining 13.6% on average after he named them. In particular, shares of a specialized telecommunications company and a discount retailer connected to give Cinnamond MarketWatch's Stockpicker of the Quarter award. In winning, Cinnamond surpassed 18 other investment professionals featured in MarketWatch's column ""The Stockpickers"" in the second quarter of 2008. In these stories, investors select three stocks whose performance is then tracked over the following 13 weeks -- the last period of which began June 27 and ended Sept. 26. Favored stocks can be domestic or international, covering all market sizes, investment styles and industry sectors. Each stock picker is reviewed on how selections performed from the closing price on the nearest trading day before the story is published through the closing bell on the nearest trading day 13 weeks later. The grim investing climate in the second quarter and over the summer hit most managers featured in The Stockpickers especially hard. Double-digit losses in shares of well-known, established companies were not uncommon. Cinnamond found success at the other end of the spectrum, investing in smaller companies in niche businesses that he prized for being cash-rich, solidly managed and not widely followed. Intrepid Small Cap slid 1.3% from the close on April 21 through the end of trading on July 21. That result was better than the 2.5% decline for the small-cap focused Russell 2000 Index RUT, -1.99% in that period, and well ahead of its small-value category's 5% average loss, according to investment researcher Morningstar Inc. The fund's investment in Applied Signal Technology APSG rallied sharply. Shares of the maker of telecommunications and signal processing gear soared 31.7% in the 13 weeks after Cinnamond recommended it. Meanwhile, the weakening economy was a boon for Family Dollar Stores Inc. FDO, +7.10% an off-price retail chain whose shares rose 14.1% in the 13 weeks. A third stock, Mocon Inc. MOCO a maker of instruments used to detect, measure, and analyze gases and chemicals, finished the period down 5%. Patterson-UTI Energy The energy sector has been in the crosshairs of the slowing global economy, and these former market darlings have been so beaten up they're attracting Cinnamond's attention. The fund didn't own energy stocks at the end of the third quarter; now the sector represents about 8% of assets. ""Everyone loved energy with oil at $140 a barrel,"" Cinnamond said. Now, with oil prices just above $60, ""everyone hates it."" That's reason enough for value buyers like Cinnamond to go digging. One company he's unearthed is oil-services outfit Patterson-UTI Energy Inc. PTEN, -4.20% Day rates for oil rigs have declined, taking down Patterson's core drilling business and its shares. Shares of Patterson-UTI Energy closed Monday at $12.63 -- a fraction of their 52-week high of $37.45 set in July. Patterson's shares are oversold, Cinnamond said. He sees a cash-rich company that pays a dividend of around 5% and a stock that should trade closer to $35 a share. ""I'm not going to time when energy is going to turn,"" Cinnamond said. ""But I know Patterson is going to take market share because there's a lot of leveraged companies out there that aren't going to make it."" Gencor Industries Cinnamond is also upbeat about Gencor Industries GENC, -1.86% which produces asphalt for road construction. The stock has been routed as the U.S. economy sputtered and the outlook for infrastructure and other construction projects darkened. Shares of Gencor finished Monday's session at $6.50; the stock fetched $32.88 in May. But for a value investor, Gencor is appealing, Cinnamond said. Gencor's recent $59 million market capitalization values the company at a discount to the cash on its balance sheet, which alone is worth about $8 a share, he noted. Plus, the company owns a parcel of land in Orlando, Fla. that isn't being factored into the share price, Cinnamond said. In addition, that cash hoard allows Gencor to operate without borrowing, keeping the company financially sound, the fund manager said. And the stock isn't widely covered. ""Most of the companies we follow aren't relying on the credit markets,"" Cinnamond said. ""I'd rather own a company that isn't dependent on the generosity of Wall Street."" Oil-Dri Corporation of America Oil-Dri Corporation of America ODC, -3.01% operates a line of branded consumer products -- though its target customers are of the feline variety. The company is the market leader in cat litter, including the well-known Jonny Cat and Cat's Pride brands. It also sells private-label products to Wal-Mart Stores and makes the Fresh Step brand litter for Clorox. Most investors wouldn't give much thought to a company like Oil-Dri, which is one reason why the stock is part of Cinnamond's portfolio. Oil-Dri's business stems from its vast reserves of clay, which is used not just for cat litter but for agriculture, machine shops, cleaning oil spills and other absorbent tasks. What's hurt Oil-Dri recently is the high price of natural gas that helps dry clay, Cinnamond said, adding that the additional expense has chopped into the company's profit margins. The shares traded at $16.28 on Monday, down from a 52-week high of $23.60 last December. Cinnamond said he has a high degree of confidence in Oil-Dri's ability to navigate the obstacles it faces, and accordingly he's made it a prominent fund holding. ""Most of the companies we own,"" he said, ""are in relatively stable end markets."" Applied Signal Technology As for the stocks Cinnamond recommended in late April, Applied Signal Technology is still among the Intrepid fund's biggest holdings. ""It generates quite a bit of cash, and nothing's really changed except their cash has gone up,"" Cinnamond said. ""They've got some growth ahead of them and orders are very strong. I think there's a near-term catalyst on earnings."" The fund manager tapped Applied Signal at $11.32 a share. After 13 weeks, the stock traded at $14.91. The shares ended Monday's session at $18.02. Family Dollar Stores Cinnamond bought into Family Dollar Stores earlier this year when retail stocks were trampled and the fund manager thought the company's shares had been unfairly punished. He recommended Family Dollar Stores at $20.36 a share, and 13 weeks later the stock traded at $23.24. But that price was close to Cinnamond's fair value; he sold the position in early August. Shares of Family Dollar Stores closed at $26.94 on Monday. ""We're very disciplined about selling when a stock hits our valuation,"" Cinnamond said. ""It's back on my wish list, but the valuation is not there."" Mocon Mocon continues to be one of Cinnamond's favorites. The gas and chemical firm is a ""very profitable business,"" he said, and its shares, he added, are ""really cheap for a company with 20% operating margins."" The company has a market value of just $47 million but is a ""market leader,"" he added. Its spending more on marketing, sales and international growth, and yet has enough cash to pay an attractive dividend of around 4%, Cinnamond noted. The shares didn't fare so well in the 13 weeks after Cinnamond recommended them, slipping to $10.64 from $11.20. On Monday, shares of Mocon finished trading at $8.94. But given Cinnamond's focus on value, Mocon remains a top holding. ""Things overshoot, but that's what creates opportunity,"" he said. ""I love it when stocks fall because I'm able to buy them at a cheaper price.""

In reaction to one credit analyst's comment that it is effectively bankrupt, Ford bristles and notes that it has $14 billion in long-term debt and $25 billion in cash. GM, in contrast, is saddled with a potential big payout in its partnership with Fiat and carries pension and medical coverage obligations to retired workers that total $77 billion. Gradco Systems GRDCE which makes paper-handling equipment, said late Friday that because of errors that have been corrected, its first quarter net loss is lower than previously reported, with an 8 cent per share loss instead of 11 cents. Halliburton HAL, -3.24% the giant energy services and engineering and construction firm once run by Vice President Dick Cheney, is out of the running for a $600 million rebuilding contract in Iraq, Newsweek reported Friday. The Houston-based company did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The magazine said it was unclear whether Halliburton removed itself from contention, whether its bid was uncompetitive, or if the Bush administration eliminated the firm from the short list of finalists. Shares of the company lost 34 cents to trade at $21.10 in after-hours dealings. See full story. Instinet Group said late Friday it plans to lay off 175 workers, about 12 percent of its work force. The trimming is part of cost-cutting expected to bring $20 million in savings annually. Chief executive Edward J. Nicoll said the savings would be in addition to $100 million in cost cuts already announced at the electronic stock-trading exchange. See full story. Alan Abelson's column in Barron's has a simple caution: Tech stinks. Fred Hickey of High-Tech Strategist passes along his short-selling positions in Intel INTC, -7.71% IBM IBM, -2.82% and chip-gear maker KLA-Tencor KLAC, -3.66% He doesn't like EBay's EBAY, -2.67% price, forecasting a potential 20-point drop. Hickey's on the long side, however, of 3Com COMS after it ""cleaned up its act"" and now poses a challenge to Cisco via an accord with China's Huawei Technologies. Juno Lighting JUNO reported first-quarter results after Friday's bell, with a 5 percent sales gain to $43.5 million compared to year-earlier $41.4 million. Net income was 1 cent per share; a year earlier the maker of light fixtures had a net loss of $1.02 per share. Software maker Marimba MRBA said late Friday that it made accounting changes regarding executive bonuses and a reserve for sales returns.

Merrimac Industries MRM, +0.58% which makes microwave equipment, said late Friday that it filed for an extension on its 10-K annual report while it negotiates new financial covenants with a key lender. Energy exploration firm Mission Resources MSSN said late Friday that it repurchased $97.6 million of its 10 7/8 percent notes for $71.7 million plus accrued interest, in a private deal with Farallon Capital Management. Mission said the funds came from an $80 million credit facility at 12 percent interest that it reached with Farallon Energy Lending. Fitness-equipment maker Nautilus Group NLS, -1.86% has seen its share price shrivel, and Barron's says the latest numbers show 30 percent of its stock was sold short as of March 14. The concern is that Nautilus is dependent on sales of its Bowflex, which has patents due to expire. Eric Wold of CTX Securities tells Barron's he sees a lower profit picture this year but gains in the following year as the Bowflex switches from a direct-to-customer sales mold to a distribution that will use sports-equipment retailers. Netguru NGRU a maker of engineering software, said late Friday that it expects breakeven results for the fourth quarter ending Monday, with positive operational cash flow in the next fiscal year. Netguru said it has at least 15 possible contracts worth about $100,000 apiece, a delivery in the coming quarter with an estimated $600,000 in cash flow and a cash-positive information technology unit. Oil-Dri ODC, -3.01% said late Friday that it is raising prices of its automotive and kitty litter products to recoup the rising costs of oil, natural gas and diesel fuel. Glass maker Owens-Illinois OI, -2.86% said late Friday that energy costs will affect its 2003 performance. As a result, OI said its full-year EPS is estimated at $1.60 compared with Thomson First Call expectations of $1.78. The company said that if natural gas prices in 2003 remain above the 2002 level, its contracts with customers have pricing formulas that will raise revenue in 2004. Pfizer PFE, -1.52% said late Friday that it completed the sale of its Schick-Wilkinson Sword division to Energizer Holdings for $920 million in cash. Presstek PRST, +0.00% which makes printing products, said late Friday that it adjusted fourth-quarter revenue by adding $1 million from a reserve it had established to deal with issues it had with Xerox XRX, -2.68% As a result, net income for the quarter rose to 7 cents a share from previously reported 4 cents. Provident Bancorp PBCP said late Friday that its board approved a third stock repurchase, authorizing a buyback of up to 5 percent of common shares, which it estimated would cost about $5.5 million. Salon Media Group SALN, -30.00% said Friday that it received $800,000 in additional financing that will allow it to continue operations while it works to become profitable. The company warned last month that it was desperately short of cash. Salon also announced that it now has more than 60,000 paid subscribers, up from 47,000 at the end of 2002. See full story.

Semtech said it will make insurance claims on the settlement. Fitch Ratings late Friday downgraded the rating on about $285 million of debt securities from Sun Communities Operating L.P. SUI, -0.66% and also dropped the rating on $50 million of preferred stock. Fitch said the portfolio of loans in manufactured home communities is suffering from a lowered occupancy level. Doubts were raised about cash flow, higher levels of debt and performance in a weakened economy. Food supplier Sysco SYY, -2.60% said late Friday that it will acquire Colorado Boxed Beef and J&B Foodservice. No terms were disclosed, though Sysco said the companies generated about $76 million in sales in the pas fiscal year.

ODC,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the financial statements and the related notes included herein and our Consolidated Financial Statements, accompanying notes and Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contained in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and Item 1A, Risk Factors, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2016. OVERVIEW We develop, mine, manufacture and market sorbent products principally produced from clay minerals and, to a lesser extent, other clay-like sorbent materials. Our principal products include agricultural and horticultural chemical carriers, animal health and nutrition products, bleaching clay and fluid purification aids, cat litter, industrial and automotive floor absorbents and sports field products. Our products are sold to two primary customer groups, including customers who resell our products as originally produced to the end consumer and those who use our products as part of their production process or use them as an ingredient in their final finished product. We have two reportable operating segments based on the different characteristics of our two primary customer groups: Retail and Wholesale Products Group and Business to Business Products Group, as described in Note 7 of the notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2017 COMPARED TO NINE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2016  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Consolidated net sales for the nine months ended April 30, 2017 were $196,531,000, compared to net sales of $197,397,000 for the nine months ended April 30, 2016. Net sales were down for our Retail and Wholesale Products Group, but were up for our Business to Business Products Group. Consolidated net income for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $9,470,000, a 13% increase from net income of $8,352,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Both segments reported higher operating income, as described further below. Diluted net income per share was $1.29 for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, compared to $1.15 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was 29%, compared to 30% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Gross profit in fiscal 2017 was negatively impacted by the cost of natural gas used to operate kilns that dry our clay. The cost of natural gas per manufactured ton was approximately 27% higher than the prior year. Other manufacturing costs per ton produced were up approximately 6% compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year, including higher expenses for employee benefits, depreciation, wages, repairs and salaries. Gross profit was positively impacted by approximately 3% lower packaging costs per manufactured ton. A significant amount of our packaging purchases are subject to contractual price adjustments throughout the year based on underlying commodity prices. Prices for commodities may fluctuate considerably, particularly commodities related to our resin and paper-based packaging. The lower packaging costs reflected favorable commodity prices at the time of the most recent price adjustment. Total selling, general and administrative expenses were 2% lower for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The decrease was driven by lower advertising expense in the Retail and Wholesale Products Group. The discussion of the segments' operating incomes below describe the changes in the selling, general and administrative expenses that were allocated to the operating segments. The remaining unallocated corporate expenses in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 included increased pension expense and additional costs related to the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning software. These higher corporate expenses were partially offset by a lower estimated annual incentive bonus accrual compared to the prior year. The incentive bonus accruals were based on performance targets established for each fiscal year. Tax expense was 19% of pre-tax income for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, compared to 27% for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate was based on the estimated level of our taxable income for the year and the assessment of various deductions, including depletion. The lower fiscal 2017 effective tax rate resulted from an estimated depletion deduction which was a greater percentage of pre-tax income compared to fiscal 2016. BUSINESS TO BUSINESS PRODUCTS GROUP Net sales of the Business to Business Products Group for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 were $74,893,000, an increase of $3,974,000, or 6%, from net sales of $70,919,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Net sales of our animal health and nutrition products increased approximately 19%. Sales were higher in domestic and most foreign markets, particularly in Asia. In Latin America, the transition to a new distributor negatively impacted sales. Sales for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 also included customer trials of our new Varium poultry growth promoter. See ""Foreign Operations"" below for further discussion of increased animal health and nutrition sales by our subsidiary in China. Net sales of our fluids purification products were up approximately 9%. Sales to edible oil producers accounted for much of the sales improvement, which included sales to a new customer in Europe added in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Lower sales from normal ordering fluctuations of customers in the petroleum oil processing industry partially offset this increase. Net sales of our agricultural chemical carrier products were essentially flat compared to the first nine months of the prior year. Sales of our co-packaged coarse cat litter were approximately 8% lower due to fewer tons sold and a price adjustment under our co-packaging agreement. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Business to Business Products Group were approximately 2% lower due primarily to lower costs to promote our animal health and nutrition products. The Business to Business Products Group's operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $25,033,000, an increase of $984,000, or 4%, from operating income of $24,049,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The benefits of higher sales and lower packaging costs more than offset higher natural gas and other manufacturing costs. See ""Consolidated Results"" above for further discussion of packaging, natural gas and manufacturing costs. RETAIL AND WHOLESALE PRODUCTS GROUP Net sales of the Retail and Wholesale Products Group for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 were $121,638,000, a decrease of $4,840,000, or 4%, from net sales of $126,478,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Total cat litter net sales declined approximately 5% compared to the first nine months of the prior year. Lower sales of both our branded and private label cat litters was largely attributed to the decision to exit low margin business with two major customers. Through the first nine months we continued our integrated marketing campaign to generate awareness and trial of lightweight cat litter products, although we spent significantly less for advertising in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our promotional efforts delivered higher sales of both our Cat's Pride Fresh & Light Ultimate Care and our private label lightweight scoopable litters for the first nine months of fiscal 2017. Sales of industrial and automotive absorbent products were essentially flat compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Nine month sales for our subsidiary in Canada were higher than the prior year, while sales for our subsidiary in the United Kingdom were lower. See ""Foreign Operations"" below for further discussion about the sales and types of products sold by these foreign subsidiaries. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Retail and Wholesale Products Group were 9% lower compared to the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Advertising expense decreased approximately $1,400,000 due to lower expenditures for the integrated marketing campaign to promote our Fresh & Light Ultimate Care lightweight cat litter, which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect to continue promoting lightweight litter through the remainder of fiscal 2017. However, we plan to reallocate some of our anticipated spending between advertising, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and trade promotions, which are included as a reduction of net sales. Although we expect advertising expense will be significant for the full year of fiscal 2017, the total is anticipated to be down from the corresponding expense in fiscal 2016. The Retail and Wholesale Products Group's operating income for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was $5,996,000, an increase of $314,000, or 6%, from operating income of $5,682,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The reduction in advertising costs, as discussed above, more than offset higher natural gas and other manufacturing costs. See ""Consolidated Results"" above for further discussion of packaging, natural gas and manufacturing costs. FOREIGN OPERATIONS Foreign operations include our subsidiaries in Canada and the United Kingdom, which are included in the Retail and Wholesale Products Group, and our subsidiary in China, which is included in the Business to Business Products Group. Net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during the first nine months of fiscal 2017 were $9,344,000, a 13% increase compared to net sales of $8,270,000 during the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Our subsidiary in China reported higher sales for animal health and nutrition products with approximately 29% more tons sold, including sales to new customers. Sales by our subsidiary in Canada increased for branded and private label lightweight cat litter. In addition, a new Canadian distributor provided increased sales of industrial absorbent products. These increases were partially offset by lower export sales of fluids purification products sold by our subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented 5% and 4% of our consolidated net sales during the first nine months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of $41,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to a net loss of $750,000 for the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The improved profitability was driven primarily by the higher sales. Identifiable assets of our foreign subsidiaries as of April 30, 2017 were $7,719,000, compared to $8,017,000 as of April 30, 2016. The decrease was due primarily to lower net fixed assets, deferred income taxes and accounts receivable, which were partially offset by higher inventories. THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2017 COMPARED TO THREE MONTHS ENDED APRIL 30, 2016  CONSOLIDATED RESULTS Consolidated net sales for the three months ended April 30, 2017 were $64,745,000, compared to net sales of $64,235,000 for the three months ended April 30, 2016. Net sales were up for our Business to Business Products Group, but were down for our Retail and Wholesale Products Group. Consolidated net income was $3,211,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to a net loss of $892,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Third quarter operating income increased for both our Business to Business Products and Retail and Wholesale Products Groups compared to the prior year. Significantly lower advertising expense in the quarter, as described below, drove improvements in both consolidated net income and the Retail and Wholesale Products Group's operating income. Diluted net income per share was $0.44 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to a diluted net loss per share of $0.13 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Consolidated gross profit as a percentage of net sales for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was 27%, compared to 29% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Higher natural gas and other manufacturing costs more than offset lower freight costs in the third quarter of fiscal 2017. The cost per manufactured ton for natural gas used to operate kilns that dry our clay increased approximately 54%. Other manufacturing costs per ton produced were up approximately 7%, including higher expenses for wages, benefits, repairs and depreciation. Packaging costs were essentially flat compared to the third quarter of the prior fiscal year. Total selling, general and administrative expenses were 29% lower for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The discussion of the segments' operating incomes below describe the selling, general and administrative expenses allocated to the operating segments, particularly lower advertising expense in the Retail and Wholesale Products Group. The remaining unallocated corporate expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2017 included increased pension expense and a higher estimated annual incentive bonus accrual, as well as additional costs related to the implementation of our new enterprise resource planning software. The incentive bonus accruals were based on performance targets established for each fiscal year. Tax expense was 15% of pre-tax income for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to 28% for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our effective tax rate was based on the estimated level of our taxable income for the year and the assessment of various tax deductions, including depletion. The lower fiscal 2017 effective tax rate resulted from an estimated depletion deduction which was a greater percentage of pre-tax income compared to fiscal 2016. BUSINESS TO BUSINESS PRODUCTS GROUP Net sales of the Business to Business Products Group for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $24,159,000, an increase of $1,686,000, or 8%, from net sales of $22,473,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Net sales of our fluids purification products were up approximately 13%. Sales to edible oil producers accounted for much of the sales improvement, which included sales to a new customer in Europe added in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2016. Sales of our animal health and nutrition products increased approximately 11% across domestic and foreign markets. Third quarter sales included customer trials of our new Varium poultry growth promoter. See ""Foreign Operations"" below for further discussion of increased animal health and nutrition sales by our subsidiary in China. Net sales of our agricultural chemical carriers to manufacturers of crop protection products were up slightly compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Sales of co-packaged coarse cat litter were approximately 4% lower than in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 due to fewer tons sold and a price adjustment under our co-packaging agreement. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Business to Business Products Group were 3% lower due primarily to lower costs to promote our animal health and nutrition products and collection of a previously reserved account receivable. The Business to Business Products Group's operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $7,810,000, an increase of $506,000, or 7%, from operating income of $7,304,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The benefits of higher sales and lower selling, general and administrative expenses more than offset increased natural gas and other manufacturing costs. See ""Consolidated Results"" above for further discussion of manufacturing and packaging costs. RETAIL AND WHOLESALE PRODUCTS GROUP Net sales of the Retail and Wholesale Products Group for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $40,586,000, a decrease of $1,176,000, or 3%, from net sales of $41,762,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Total cat litter net sales declined approximately 4% compared to the third quarter of the prior year. Significantly less spending for advertising compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 contributed to lower branded scoopable litter sales; however, higher sales of our private label lightweight litters partially offset the decline. Lower sales of both our private label and branded coarse litters for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the prior year reflected the decline of this segment of the market. Sales of sports products were up approximately 5% compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016 due to higher volume. Sales of industrial and automotive absorbent products for the quarter were essentially the same as the prior year. Third quarter sales for our subsidiaries in both Canada and the United Kingdom were higher than the prior year. See ""Foreign Operations"" below for further discussion about the sales and types of products sold by these foreign subsidiaries. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Retail and Wholesale Products Group were 52% lower compared to the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The decrease was driven by approximately $6,400,000 lower advertising expense for our integrated marketing campaign to promote our Fresh & Light Ultimate Care lightweight cat litter, which began in the second quarter of fiscal 2016. We expect to continue promoting lightweight litter through the remainder of fiscal 2017. However, we plan to reallocate some of our anticipated spending between advertising, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses, and trade promotions, which are included as a reduction of net sales. Although we expect advertising expense will be significant for the full year of fiscal 2017, the total is anticipated to be down from the corresponding expense in fiscal 2016. The Retail and Wholesale Products Group's operating income for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1,516,000, compared to an operating loss of $4,015,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. The increase in operating income was driven by the lower advertising costs discussed above. The reduction in advertising costs more than offset higher natural gas and other manufacturing costs. See ""Consolidated Results"" above for further discussion of these cost changes. FOREIGN OPERATIONS Foreign operations include our subsidiaries in Canada and the United Kingdom, which are included in the Retail and Wholesale Products Group, and our subsidiary in China, which is included in the Business to Business Products Group. Net sales by our foreign subsidiaries during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 were $2,869,000, a 5% increase compared to net sales of $2,738,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Our subsidiary in China reported higher sales for animal health and nutrition products with approximately 4% more tons sold, including sales to new customers. Sales also increased for industrial absorbent products sold by our subsidiary in Canada, due primarily to a new distributor, and for export and domestic sales of fluids purification products by our subsidiary in the United Kingdom. Net sales by our foreign subsidiaries represented approximately 4% of our consolidated net sales during the third quarters of both fiscal 2017 and 2016. Our foreign subsidiaries reported a net loss of $339,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to a net loss of $214,000 for the third quarter of fiscal 2016. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our principal capital requirements include: funding working capital needs; purchasing and upgrading equipment, facilities, information systems and real estate; supporting new product development; investing in infrastructure; repurchasing Common Stock; paying dividends; and business acquisitions. During the first nine months of fiscal 2017, we principally used cash generated from operations to fund these requirements. We also have the ability to borrow under our revolving credit agreement with BMO Harris Bank N.A. (""BMO Harris""), as described further below, however we have not borrowed under the credit agreement in recent years. Cash and cash equivalents decreased $5,026,000 during the first nine months of fiscal 2017 to $13,603,000; however, short term investments increased $8,516,000 during the same period to $18,700,000 as of April 30, 2017. The following table sets forth certain elements of our Condensed Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (in thousands):  For the Nine Months Ended April 30, 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 21,033 $ 19,409 Net cash used in investing activities (18,858 ) (15,093 ) Net cash used in financing activities (7,261 ) (7,343 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 60 83 Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (5,026 ) $ (2,944 )  Net cash provided by operating activities In addition to net income, as adjusted for depreciation and amortization and other non-cash operating activities, the primary sources and uses of operating cash flows for the first nine months of fiscal years 2017 and 2016 were as follows: Accounts receivable, less allowance for doubtful accounts, increased $1,633,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to a decrease of $2,289,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The change in accounts receivable balances reflected differences in the level and timing of sales and collections, as well as the payment terms provided to various customers. Inventories increased $617,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to an increase of $3,653,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The substantial increase in fiscal 2016 was due to anticipated sales following the launch of our integrated marketing campaign to promote our Fresh & Light Ultimate Care lightweight cat litter. Prepaid expenses increased $1,171,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to an increase of $593,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was due primarily to higher prepaid advertising expenses. Prepaid income taxes drove of the increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Prepayments of annual insurance premiums in both fiscal years contributed to the increase in both fiscal years to a lesser extent. Other assets increased $669,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to an increase of $270,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The increase in fiscal 2017 included prepayments for long-term computer software licenses. The cash surrender value of life insurance on former key employees increased in the first nine months of both fiscal years. Accounts payable increased $1,848,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to a decrease of $1,383,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. Trade and freight payable varied in both periods due to timing of payments, fluctuations in the cost of goods and services we purchased, production volume levels and vendor payment terms. In addition, we performed a review of our vendor payment terms in fiscal 2017 and adjusted the timing of our payments accordingly. Current accrued estimated income taxes are also included in accounts payable balances. Accrued expenses increased $627,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to an increase of $3,365,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The payout of the prior fiscal year's discretionary incentive bonus drove lower accrued salaries in the first nine months of fiscal 2017, while the increase in the first nine months of fiscal 2016 was driven by a higher incentive bonus accrual. Accrued plant expenses fluctuated in the first nine months of both fiscal years due to timing of payments, changes in the cost of goods and services we purchased, production volume levels and vendor payment terms. In addition, accrued trade promotions and advertising varied due to the timing of marketing programs. Accrued pension and postretirement benefits increased $1,133,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2017 compared to an increase of $757,000 in the first nine months of fiscal 2016. The trend of a lower discount rate used to estimate the value of these accrued benefits resulted in higher liabilities.

The agreement also provides for a maximum of $5,000,000 for foreign letters of credit. Under the agreement we may select a variable interest rate based on either the BMO Harris prime rate or a LIBOR-based rate, plus a margin which varies depending on our debt to earnings ratio, or a fixed rate as agreed between us and BMO Harris. At April 30, 2017, the variable rates would have been 4.00% for the BMO Harris prime-based rate or 2.16% for the LIBOR-based rate. The credit agreement contains restrictive covenants that, among other things and under various conditions, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness or to dispose of assets. The agreement also requires us to maintain a minimum fixed coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated net worth. We did not borrow under the credit agreement during the nine months ended April 30, 2017 and 2016, and we were in compliance with its covenants. . . .

ODC,"CHICAGO, Oct 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Amlan International, a global leader in feed additives that improve intestinal health, today announced the opening of its Richard M. Jaffee Laboratory for Applied Microbiology located at the company's Innovation Center in Vernon Hills, Illinois. The investment includes advanced microbiologists, research instruments and equipment dedicated to accelerating Amlan's technical expertise and new product development. The Company also announced the hiring of two Senior Research Microbiologists, Dongping Wang, Ph.D. and Shalaka Shinde, Ph.D. The new teammates are experienced microbiologists with specialized expertise and will help advance the company's efforts in Life Sciences research. The Biosafety Level 2 lab enables the examination of materials, such as animal feed, intestinal tissue and feces, and their interaction with bacteria or fungus. Pathogen identification, biotoxin diagnosis and bacterial strain enumeration can now be achieved with the lab's technical and diagnostic capabilities such as the analyses of DNA and RNA proteins (PCR), antimicrobial assays (MIC & MBC), cellular and morphological analyses (Optical Microscopy) and tissue culturing. Dr. Ron Cravens, President of Amlan International, a Nevada corporation, stated, ""We are excited that the new lab will allow us to further our understanding of how our products support intestinal health from within the microbiota. Additionally, we aspire to leverage our expertise and new tools to collaborate with our customers by offering diagnostic testing and technical support. I am confident that the new lab will allow us to optimize our existing product offerings and take product development to new heights."" The lab was named after Richard M. Jaffee, Chairman of Amlan's parent company, Oil-Dri Corporation of America. His pioneering spirit and vision for Oil-Dri to conduct research in life sciences has been influential in the development of Amlan's value-added animal health products.

ODC,"CHICAGO, Oct 10, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Oil-Dri Corporation of America ODC, -2.04% today announced net income of $10,792,000 or $1.47 of earnings per diluted share for fiscal 2017, compared to net income of $13,613,000 or $1.87 of earnings per diluted share in the prior year. Net sales for the twelve-months were $262,307,000 compared to net sales of $262,313,000 in the same period of fiscal 2016. Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2017 was $1,322,000 or $0.18 of earnings per diluted share, compared to net income of $5,261,000 or $0.72 per diluted share in the same period of the prior year. Net sales for the fourth quarter were $65,776,000 compared to net sales of $64,916,000 in the same period of fiscal 2016. A higher, but more traditionally normal tax rate drove a lower net income in fiscal 2017 compared to fiscal 2016. The unusually low tax rate in fiscal 2016 resulted from the full release of the valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax asset for domestic AMT credits. Our Cash and Investment balances grew by approximately $3,900,000 over fiscal 2016. We now have approximately $20,000,000 more in cash and investments than we have in short and long term debt. BUSINESS REVIEW President and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel S. Jaffee said, ""The positives of fiscal 2017 performance might be missed when performance is only compared with the prior year and fourth quarter results, which benefited from a tax rate that was about 25% of our historical average. Fiscal 2017 had the second highest pre-tax income in our company's history, but the return to our historical average tax rate resulted in much of the overall per share earnings decline. We are confident in our strategy to concentrate on profitable lightweight cat litter and value-added Business to Business products. We have plans in place to respond to the approximate 8% per ton increase in manufacturing costs that negatively impacted an otherwise improving gross profit. Manufacturing increases were driven by increased labor, employee benefits and depreciation costs, many of which should be positively impacted by the production efficiency initiatives that will be implemented in 2018. The private label lightweight segment of the cat litter market continued to grow during the year. Sales of our private label lightweight litter increased significantly during fiscal 2017. This increase is the result of additional distribution and increased sales velocity as our retail partners line priced the lightweight items with their heavy scoopable items. Sales increased over the prior year for the Business to Business Products Group. Our Amlan International business benefited from increased sales by its subsidiary in China and increased sales of Varium, our natural growth promotion product for poultry. Sales of Pure-Flo bleaching earths in the EMEA region (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) increased for the quarter and positively impacted sales in 2017.""

Net sales of our fluids purification products increased approximately 4%. Net sales of our agricultural carrier products were approximately 2% higher. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 2% due to reduced costs for promotion and development of our animal health products.

The decline was partially a result of our decision not to pursue continued business with two major low margin customers. Net sales decreased for heavyweight scoopable litters due to competition from new competitive products. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased approximately 17%. Segment income increased due to a $4,300,000 reduction in advertising costs and the benefit of higher selling prices. FINANCIAL REVIEW (Fiscal Year 2017 Ended July 31) At July 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $32,671,000, a 13% increase compared to $28,813,000 one year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $26,949,000, which was $1,778,000 higher than the $25,171,000 for the same period last year. The change in deferred income taxes contributed to the increase. Deferred income tax changes were driven by accruals for postretirement benefits and trade promotions. Increased accounts payable and lower inventory levels also improved cash from operating activities. Higher accounts receivable and prepaid expenses partially offset these cash increases. Capital expenditures for the period totaled $14,763,000, which was $1,991,000 more than depreciation and amortization of $12,772,000. Capital expenditures included spending for the new enterprise resource planning system implementation and related infrastructure improvements, as well as equipment replacement at our manufacturing facilities. By comparison, capital expenditures totaled $10,684,000 one year ago. On June 14, 2017, Oil-Dri's Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.23 per share of outstanding Common Stock and $0.173 per share of outstanding Class B Stock. The dividends were paid on September 1, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on August 18, 2017. The Company has paid cash dividends continuously since 1974 and has increased dividends annually for each of the last fourteen years. At the end of the fourth quarter, the annualized dividend yield on the Company's Common Stock was 2.2%, based on the closing stock price on July 31, 2017 of $41.36 per share and the latest quarterly cash dividend of $0.23 per share. LOOKING FORWARD President and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Jaffee continued, ""We are focused on long-term growth and supporting our most profitable products. We have started fiscal 2018 with a strong cash position and know that it will be an exciting year as we continue investing in our future. We will be launching a new integrated marketing campaign in support of our lightweight litters and expect advertising expense in fiscal 2018 to be at similar levels as fiscal 2017. Also in 2018, we will continue promoting our value-added Business to Business products as they gain market share, implement a new enterprise resource planning system and improve overall production efficiencies. In an effort to engage more dynamically with our investor community, we have decided to focus our energies on quarterly teleconferences. This news release is the last scheduled earnings-focused news release. Our financial results will continue to be available in our quarterly 10-Q and annual 10-K filings and will be discussed on our investor teleconferences.

ODC,"CHICAGO, Jun 07, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Oil-Dri Corporation of America ODC today announced net income of $3,211,000 or $0.44 of earnings per diluted share for the third quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to a net loss of $892,000 or $(0.13) per diluted share in the same period of the prior year. Net sales for the quarter were $64,745,000 compared to net sales of $64,235,000 in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. Net income for the nine-months was $9,470,000 or $1.29 of earnings per diluted share, a 12% increase compared to net income of $8,352,000 or $1.15 of earnings per diluted share in the same period of the prior year. Net sales for the nine-months were $196,531,000 compared to net sales of $197,397,000 in the same period of fiscal 2016. BUSINESS REVIEW President and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel S. Jaffee said, ""While sales were sluggish in the quarter and nine-month periods, our profits continue to improve. Our Business-to-Business products showed top line and bottom line growth in both periods. In the Retail and Wholesale segment, advertising expenses were substantially reduced compared to expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2016. This was due in large part to a strategic shift away from mass media towards targeted trade promotions throughout the balance of the year. Year over year, we experienced a nearly 17% increase in Cash and Investments. This increase is attributed to the increase of income over the nine-month period. Third party market research data for retail sales [1] (which does not include e-commerce sales) indicates that total cat litter category sales experienced modest growth in both the latest 52 and 12-week periods ending May 20, 2017. While combined sales of all of our branded products were down in both periods, we have gained a larger share of the private label lightweight litter segment. According to the same third party market research data, our private label retail sales were up approximately 43% for the latest 52-week period and 107% for the latest 12-week period.""

Net sales of animal health products were up both domestically and internationally. Strong growth continued for our Chinese subsidiary, Amlan Trading (Shenzhen) Company, Ltd. and strengthened sales in Asia. A change in distribution negatively impacted Latin America nine-month sales. This change was made in anticipation of growing our Latin American business in Fiscal 2018 and beyond. Segment income reflected higher sales, which more than offset higher natural gas and other manufacturing costs. Lower marketing costs for animal health products also contributed to the increase in segment income for the nine-month period.  RETAIL AND WHOLESALE   Third Quarter     Three-Month Period         February 1 - April 30   Change     Fiscal 2017   Fiscal 2016     Net Sales   $ 40,586,000     $ 41,762,000       -3 % Segment Income   $ 1,516,000     $ (4,015,000 )     N/M               Year-To-Date     Nine-Month Period         August 1 - April 30   Change     Fiscal 2017   Fiscal 2016     Net Sales   $ 121,638,000     $ 126,478,000       -4 % Segment Income   $ 5,996,000     $ 5,682,000       6 %  The removal of low margin cat litter business significantly contributed to lower net sales of branded and private label cat litters in the nine-month period. Sales of coarse cat litter and branded scoopable cat litter decreased in the third quarter. Increased sales of private label lightweight scoopable litters in both the third quarter and nine-month periods partially offset these sales declines. Improved segment income included a reduction in advertising expense of approximately $6,400,000 for the third quarter and $1,400,000 for the nine-months, compared to the same periods in the prior year. FINANCIAL REVIEW (Nine-Month Period of Fiscal 2017 Ended April 30) At April 30, 2017, cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments totaled $32,303,000 compared to $27,687,000 one year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $21,033,000, which was $1,624,000 higher than the $19,409,000 for the same period last year. This increase was primarily the result of higher net income. Capital expenditures for the period totaled $10,418,000 which was $865,000 more than depreciation and amortization of $9,553,000. Capital expenditures included the ongoing implementation and testing of a new enterprise resource planning system and related infrastructure improvements, as well as equipment replacement at our manufacturing facilities. By comparison, capital expenditures totaled $7,052,000 one year ago. On March 16, 2017, Oil-Dri's Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $0.22 per share of outstanding Common Stock and $0.165 per share of outstanding Class B Stock. The dividends were paid on June 2, 2017, to stockholders of record at the close of business on May 19, 2017. The Company has paid cash dividends continuously since 1974 and has increased dividends annually for each of the last thirteen years. At the end of the third quarter, the annualized dividend yield on the Company's Common Stock was 2.2%, based on the closing stock price on April 30, 2017 of $40.69 per share and the latest quarterly cash dividend of $0.22 per share. LOOKING FORWARD President and Chief Executive Officer, Daniel Jaffee continued, ""We remain focused on harnessing the potential of our value-added Business-to-Business products. We will continue to invest in sales and innovation for our animal health, fluids purification and agricultural ingredient products. According to the aforementioned third-party market research report for the latest 12-week period ending May 20, 2017, Cat's Pride Fresh & Light Ultimate Care products have a 5.1% share of the lightweight litter segment and Oil-Dri's private label lightweight litters have a 2.4% share. All of Oil-Dri's private label products account for 30.6% of the private label segment within the cat litter category. Our goal is to continue to gain further market share with both our Ultimate Care and private label products. Our integrated marketing campaign will continue to feature Ultimate Care television advertisements through July. Additionally, we are utilizing trade deals to drive additional consumer trial."" While granular clay floor absorbents were Oil-Dri's founding product, it has since diversified its portfolio to include both consumer and business to business product offerings that supply pet care, animal health, fluids purification, agricultural ingredient, sports field, industrial and automotive markets. In 2016, Oil-Dri celebrated its seventy-fifth year of business and looks forward to the next milestone. The Company will offer a live webcast of the third quarter earnings teleconference on Thursday, June 8, 2017 from 10:00 am to 10:30 am, Central Time.

ODC,"CHICAGO, May 24, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Oil-Dri Corporation of America ODC, -2.04% announced today that it will be implementing price increases on its private label heavy scoopable and non-scooping cat litters, effective August 1, 2017. The price increases are due to current cost increases and pricing trends on key components used in mining, manufacturing, shipping and include costs related to packaging, fuel and equipment. Oil-Dri introduced the first lightweight scoopable clay litter in 2011 and holds multiple patents for lightweight scoopable litter and other litter innovations. The Company produces private label litters for many large grocery outlets. In addition to its private label products, Oil-Dri sells litter and accessories under the brands Cat's Pride [(R)] , Fresh & Light [(R)] , Fresh & Light Ultimate Care [(R)] , Jonny Cat [(R)] and KatKit [(R)] . Oil-Dri's pet care products make cleaning up after cats safe and easy.  While granular clay floor absorbents were Oil-Dri's founding product, it has since diversified its portfolio to include both consumer and business to business product offerings that supply pet care, animal health, fluids purification, agricultural ingredient, sports field, industrial and automotive markets. In 2016, Oil-Dri celebrated its seventy-fifth year of business and looks forward to the next milestone. This release may contain forward-looking statements regarding the company's expected performance for future periods, and actual results for such periods may materially differ. Any such forward-looking statements are subject to uncertainties which include, but are not limited to, intense competition from much larger organizations in the consumer market; the level of success in implementation of price increases and surcharges; changes in the market conditions, the overall economy, volatility in the price and availability of natural gas, fuel oil and other energy sources, and other factors detailed from time to time in the company's annual report and other reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
