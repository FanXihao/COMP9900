AAC,"Technology stocks led the way lower in Asia on Wednesday, dragged by the sector’s slide in the U.S., as the region lost its early-week gains. The Nikkei Stock Average NIK, +1.40%   fell 1.3%, reversing much of Tuesday’s 2.7% jump. SoftBank 9984, +1.84%  slid 3.8% and Nintendo 7974, +0.43%  shed 1.8% even as the yen reversed some of the gains it made in U.S. afternoon trading. A number of Asia Pacific stock indexes fell at least 1%, including Hong Kong’s. A gauge of technology stocks fell as Tencent 0700, -0.63%   lost 4.6%, while smartphone-component suppliers AAC Technologies AAC, +1.86%   and Sunny Optical 2382, -1.70%   dropped by 6.3% and 8.1%, respectively. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index HSI, +0.24%  slumped 2.5%. South Korea’s tech-heavy Kospi SEU, +0.39%  slid 1.3%, with index heavyweight Samsung Electronics 005930, +0.37%  falling 2.6%. Ayaz Ebrahim, portfolio manager for emerging markets Asia-Pacific at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said the fund manager had reduced its “significant overweight” position in tech stocks during the past 18 months. The asset manager has shifted into financial stocks. “We believe higher interest rates will benefit insurance companies as well as banks,” he said. New Zealand’s NZX-50 NZ50GR, -0.82%   skidded 1.4%.

AAC,"Repeal and replace. Repeal and replace. That’s how Donald Trump outlined his game plan for Obamacare so often during the campaign that his supporters can be forgiven for thinking the law is now all but toast. “If Trump has any kind of a mandate at all, it is to repeal Obamacare,” says Michael Cannon, the director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute. Unfortunately, it won’t be so easy. Like it or not, Obamacare, or something similar, may well be around for a while. “Repeal and replace is easier said than done,” says Jonathan Weiner, professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. “I believe they will scale it back, but I don’t believe they will bring it to the ground.” Trump has such momentum. What could possibly get in his way? Here are his five main hurdles. 1. The Affordable Care Act, the formal name of Obamacare, has already been around long enough that a lot of people have too much to lose if it goes away. They vote. They lobby. They make campaign contributions. The Republicans who Trump needs to throw out the ACA know this. So many of them will be reluctant to help him out. “Republicans are sensitive to the fact that a lot of people got coverage under the ACA, and they are constituents in Senate and House districts,” says James Capretta, a health care policy expert at the American Enterprise Institute. Many of them vote Republican, says Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. Opinion Journal: Sick of ObamaCare There’s political precedent for anti-Obamacare bluster turning into mild reform, points out Ken Jacobs, chair of the UC Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education. Kentucky Gov. Matt Bevin, a Republican, campaigned like a lion against Obamacare to help win votes. But then he turned into a kitten once in office, toning down the rhetoric and settling for tweaks to the law. 2. Given that people on average spend about $10,000 a year on health care in the U.S., according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and there are about 20 million people in Obamacare, it’s pretty easy to see that the law sends billions of dollars a year to companies that run hospitals, offer insurance, and sell drugs. They, too, will protest any changes that hurt them. “There are a lot of industry stakeholders who stand to lose quite a bit. Black ink could turn to red ink overnight,” says Martin Gaynor, professor of economics and health policy at Carnegie Mellon University’s Heinz College. This helps explain the sharp post-election declines in the shares of hospital and insurance companies like Tenet Healthcare THC, +1.76% Community Health Systems CYH, -3.65% LifePoint Health LPNT, -1.67% Universal Health Services UHS, -2.45% AmSurg US:AMSG Envision Healthcare EVHC, +0.00% Mendax MD, +0.34% AAC Holdings AAC, +1.86% WellCare Health Plans WCG, +1.77% Aetna AET, -0.25% Molina Healthcare MOH, +2.64%  and Centene CNC, +6.50% It’s true that, in contrast, drug companies like Pfizer PFE, +0.54% Merck MRK, -1.13% Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% Mylan MYL, +1.65% Biogen BIIB, +0.74% Amgen AMGN, +0.01% Gilead Sciences GILD, +0.82% Celgene CELG, +0.90% Seattle Genetics SGEN, +1.28%   and Incyte INCY, -1.92% did well on the Trump victory news. But that’s because he and fellow Republicans will be less aggressive about pushing back on pricing than Hillary Clinton and the Democrats. Read: The death of Obamacare will bring new opportunities for investors 3. Then there’s the man himself. Trump is often all over the place on issues, and health care is no exception. At various points in his career he’s spoken out in favor of parts of Obamacare, and supported a single-payer (government) system. “He may have a mandate, but his devotion to repealing Obamacare is certainly questionable,” says the AEI’s Cannon. Opinion Journal: Trump’s Next Challenge: Congress 4. There’s potential economic fallout as well, says Jacobs. The health care sector has been one of the biggest source of new jobs for years. Cutting back on health care spending by eliminating Obamacare would no doubt cut into this job growth and therefore could hurt the economy. 5. Underlying all of this is the sheer math behind how legislation works. Our representatives in Congress can block bills via filibuster, essentially endless talking. Lawmakers in the Senate, for example, need 60 votes to overcome this, and the Republicans don’t have that kind of voting power. Sure, Trump and Republicans have a few smart bombs they could use to sink Obamacare, with no help from anyone else. 1. They can use budget reconciliation bills to block funding that supports ACA subsidies, points out Dennis Scanlon, professor of health policy and administration at Pennsylvania State University. This would send premiums skyrocketing, and essentially scuttle the program. 2. Trump could halt appeals of a court ruling in favor of a Republican legal challenge to Obamacare funding. This too would up costs of the ACA either to insurance companies or the insured, and scuttle the program. But he’s probably going to be reluctant to use any of these smart bombs, because of the potential backlash from the health care industry and the insured. To keep these groups happy, Trump’s best bet will be to repeal and replace at the same time. He needs a plan on hand that can substitute Obamacare as soon as it is eliminated. “People will accept repeal if there is a reasonable replacement that accompanies it,” says Paul Ginsburg, a health-care expert at the Brookings Institution. What might a replacement plan look like? Trump says his Obamacare “fix” will include greater broader tax deductions for premiums, the use of more health savings accounts (HSAs), and an increase in interstate competition among health insurers to bring down prices. The problem with Trump’s plan is that it doesn’t contain a lot of details, says David Bahnsen, chief investment officer of The Bahnsen Group, which is part of HighTower, a wealth management firm. Fortunately for Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) has staked out territory as the Republicans’ health-care geek. Trump will likely defer a lot of the reform planning to him, says Bahnsen. Do lawsuits drive innovation in chemical industry? Given the reform policies outlined by Ryan, and other Republicans, any Obamacare replacement plan would likely keep a key ACA component: barring insurers from blocking or penalizing people for pre-existing conditions, as long as people stay insured continuously, says Bahnsen. This means the mandate to get insurance would have to stay to bring in revenue from relatively healthy people to offset “adverse selection” of insurance plans by people with pre-existing conditions. So would some type of subsidies, possibly in the form of vouchers, tax credits and HSAs. Full time, regular employees would get deductions for premiums. But some of the rules on what must be covered would be watered down. And fewer of the previously uninsured might still have health insurance or at least subsidized health insurance, although the absence of a specific proposal means that’s somewhat speculative. “My guess is they do repeal it, and replace it with something that may end up looking a lot like Obamacare,” says Baker. “They could call it the Health Prosperity Act.” At the time of publication, Michael Brush held shares of SGEN and INCY.

AAC,"The pace of consolidation in the health-care industry has accelerated, so if you’re holding the right stocks, you’ll benefit from large deal premiums. There have been $89 billion in health-care mergers and acquisitions so far this year, compared with $56 billion during the first quarter of 2014, according to S&P Capital IQ. Investors had a full plate of deals on Monday, as a series of health-care transactions, with three featuring hefty premiums, helped send major stock indices soaring. The S&P 500 was up as much as 1.3%. Health care has been, by far, the best-performing sector in recent years. Horizon Pharma PLC HZNP, +1.00%  said it had agreed to buy Hyperion Therapeutics Inc. US:HPTX  for $46 a share in cash, or about $956 million. The premium was 8% from Friday’s close. But with shares of targeted companies typically “in play” in the weeks or months leading up to deal announcements, it’s important to look at the 30-day and 90-day premiums. Hyperion’s 30-day takeout premium was 71% and the 90-day premium was 120%, according to FactSet. Also on Monday, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. TEVA, +0.29%  announced an agrement to buy Auspex Pharmaceuticals Inc. US:ASPX  for $101 a share in cash, or roughly $3.2 billion. The takeout price represented a premium of 41% over Friday’s close, a 50% premium to the Feb. 27 close and a 100% premium to the Dec. 30 close. The third major health-care deal on Monday was UnitedHealth Group Inc.’s UNH, -2.06%  agrement to purchase Catarmaran Corp. US:CTRX which provides prescription-benefits services,  for $61.50 a share, or approximately $12.8 billion. The cash deal represented a premium of 36% over Friday’s close, while the 30-day takeout premium was only 20% and the 90-day premium was even lower, at 15%. The last deal announced on Monday had a different twist, with Fujifilm Holdings Corp. making a tender offer of $16.50 a share for Cellular Dynamics International Inc. US:ICEL  That’s a 108% premium over the target company’s closing price of $7.94 on Friday. The 30-day premium is 213% and the 90-day premium is 129%, according to FactSet. Since the beginning of 2014, there have been 39 M&A deals in the Health Technology, Health Services and Life/Health Insurance subsectors, according to FactSet.

So taking an approach of identifying the “cheapest” health-care stocks isn’t a good approach if you wish to join investors making killings on M&A deals. But there are loads of health-care stocks that sell-side analysts expect to soar over the next 12 months.

AAC,"Valeant Pharmaceuticals’ winning takeout bid for Salix Pharmaceuticals sheds light on other potential windfalls for investors as health-care companies feel the urge to merge.

Sterne Agee analyst Shibani Malhotra provided a possible example when she initiated her firm’s coverage of Akorn Inc. AKRX, -0.16%   with a “buy” rating on Feb. 4. Akorn specializes in “difficult-to-manufacture sterile and non-sterile dosage forms” for a variety of medications. The company has a market value of $4.7 billion, and Malhotra called it “one of the best, pure-play, long-term generic growth stories,” adding that one might “use volatility to build positions.” The stock is up 14% this year and trades for 17.4 times the consensus 2016 earnings estimate of $2.37, based on Friday’s closing price of $41.28. While that forward P/E ratio, based on expectations for 2016, may not seem very low when compared with ratios of 15.3 for the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38%  and 18 for the Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, +1.64% the stock’s forward PEG ratio — price/earnings to expected EPS growth — is a low 0.53%. The PEG ratio is calculated by dividing the forward P/E by FactSet’s “long-term growth estimate for three to five years,” which is based on analysts’ consensus EPS estimates. A ratio below 1 could mean that a company is undervalued because its stock is trading below a level that would reflect the expected earnings growth rate. Malhotra’s price target of $52 implies 12-month upside of 26%. In her initial research report on the company, the analyst said: “Longer term, we believe Akorn remains an acquisition target as the generics sector continues to consolidate and the company’s high tax rate and attractive portfolio offer significant synergy opportunities.” To identify other potentially attractive health-care stocks, we began with those listed on the Nasdaq, as well as any included in the S&P Composite 1500 Index that weren’t also listed on the Nasdaq. We then pared the list to companies with market capitalizations of over $100 million covered by at least three analysts with majority “buy” ratings.

Overview We are a provider of inpatient and outpatient substance use treatment services for individuals with drug addiction, alcohol addiction and co-occurring mental/behavioral health issues. In connection with our treatment services, we perform clinical diagnostic laboratory services and provide physician services to our clients. As of December 31, 2017, we operated nine residential substance abuse treatment facilities located throughout the United States, focused on delivering effective clinical care and treatment solutions across 939 residential beds, including 630 licensed detoxification beds, 19 standalone outpatient centers, and 5 sober living facilities across 409 beds for a total of 1,348 combined residential and sober living beds. We are also an internet marketer in the addiction treatment industry operating a broad portfolio of internet assets that service millions of website visits each month. Through our Recovery Brands' portfolio of websites, such as Rehabs.com and Recovery.org, we serve families and individuals struggling with addiction and seeking treatment options through comprehensive online directories of treatment providers, treatment provider reviews, forums and professional communities. Recovery Brands also provides online marketing solutions to other treatment providers such as enhanced facility profiles, audience targeting, lead generation and tools for digital reputation management. Our highly trained clinical staff deploy research-based treatment programs with structured curricula for detoxification, residential treatment, partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient care. By applying a tailored treatment program based on the individual needs of each client, many of whom require treatment for a co-occurring mental health disorder such as depression, bipolar disorder or schizophrenia, we believe we offer the level of quality care and service necessary for our clients to achieve and maintain sobriety. 2017 Developments Pending Acquisition On September 13, 2017, we, together with our subsidiary, entered into the Purchase Agreement with AdCare, and AdCare Trust. AdCare and its subsidiaries offer treatment of drug and alcohol addiction and own, among other things, a 114-bed hospital, five outpatient centers in Massachusetts, a 52-bed (46 currently licensed) residential treatment center and two outpatient centers in Rhode Island. We have agreed to acquire from AdCare Trust all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of AdCare in exchange for the following: (i) the payment by us of $70.0 million in cash, (ii) the delivery by us of such number of unregistered shares of our common stock (""Common Shares""), equal to $5.0 million divided by the average closing price per Common Share on the NYSE during the ten trading day period ending three business days prior to the closing date (the ""Closing Stock Consideration""); and (iii) the delivery of a promissory note issued by us to AdCare Trust in the principal amount of $10.0 million (the ""Promissory Note""), for aggregate consideration of $85.0 million, subject to adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The cash portion of the acquisition is anticipated to be financed through a combination of proceeds from the issuance of an incremental term loan under the 2017 Credit Facility, capacity under the 2017 Revolver and cash on hand. The Promissory Note will mature no more than 91 days after the latest maturity date of the term loans under the 2017 Credit Facility, which are currently scheduled to mature on June 30, 2023, and will bear interest on its unpaid principal amount at a fixed rate of 5.0%, compounded annually. At closing, the Closing Stock Consideration will be deposited in escrow as security for potential post-closing indemnity claims (the ""Escrow Fund"") and $0.5 million in cash will be deposited in escrow for shortfalls in AdCare's net working capital. In addition, post-closing indemnity claims for certain matters will be affected first by a set off against the Promissory Note and, to the extent such claim for indemnification exceeds the then outstanding principal and interest due under the Promissory Note, any remaining claims will be paid from the Escrow Fund. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by the parties, as well as customary indemnification provisions and termination rights for the parties. Further, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the parties have also agreed to customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to (i) the conduct of AdCare's business during the interim period between the execution of the Purchase Agreement and the completion of the acquisition; and Facility Updates In December 2017, we converted the 36 residential beds located at our San Diego Addiction Treatment Center into sober living beds in conjunction with the consolidation of our southern California operations. In October 2017, we opened Townsend Recovery Center New Orleans where we have leased one floor from New Orleans East Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana and operate 36 beds to provide detoxification and residential treatment services. In August 2017, we relocated our Recovery First West Palm facility from West Palm Beach, Florida to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. By relocating Recovery First West Palm closer to our Fort Lauderdale facility, we expect to gain additional operational efficiencies. In July 2017, we voluntarily closed our remaining beds at our Forterus facility in order to consolidate our southern California operations closer to Laguna Treatment Hospital. By consolidating our operations closer to Laguna Treatment Hospital, we gained additional operational efficiencies. As a result of closing the beds at Forterus, we had a net reduction in bed count of 37. As our residential daily census at Laguna Treatment Hospital grows, we expect to add additional sober living beds and outpatient services near our Laguna Treatment Hospital. From May 23, 2017 to July 5, 2017, our Sunrise House facility was temporarily not serving clients due to an employee strike at that location. On June 14, 2017, a settlement was reached with the union, and Sunrise House began readmitting clients on July 5, 2017. As a result of our Sunrise House facility entering into a three-year collective bargaining agreement with the HPAE on June 14, 2017, a majority of our employees at Sunrise House are now represented by a collective bargaining agreement. Bed Count Summary The following table shows the break out of our total bed count between residential beds and sober living beds as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively: As of December 31, 2017 As of December 31, 2016 Increase / (Decrease) Residential Beds 939 1,140 (201 ) Sober Living Beds 409 202 207 Total Beds 1,348 1,342 6  Financing On June 30, 2017, we entered into the 2017 Credit Facility. The 2017 Credit Facility initially made available a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $210.0 million (the ""2017 Term Loan"") and a $40.0 million revolving line of credit (the ""2017 Revolver""). The 2017 Credit Facility also provides for standby letters of credit in an aggregate undrawn amount not to exceed $7.0 million. We used the proceeds to repay $205.4 million of certain existing indebtedness under the 2015 Credit Facility and the Deerfield Facility (as defined below). For discussion of our 2017 Credit Facility, and a summary of its terms, see ""Financing Relationships"" below and Note 7 (Long-Term Debt) to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, under our 2017 Credit Facility, we had $207.4 million outstanding on our 2017 Term Loan. In addition, on September 25, 2017, we entered into an Incremental Loan Assumption Agreement (""the Incremental Agreement""), with the Incremental Revolving Credit Lenders (as defined in the Incremental Agreement), Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent (""Credit Suisse""), and the other Loan Parties (as defined in the Incremental Agreement) party thereto, relating to the 2017 Credit Facility. The Incremental Agreement provided for an increase in our existing revolving line of credit from $40.0 million to $55.0 million. On October 6, 2017, in conjunction with our pending acquisition of AdCare, we also secured a $65.0 million incremental term loan commitment in conjunction with our 2017 Credit Facility, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory provisions. In connection with the financing, we committed to a ticking fee that commenced on October 17, 2017, at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.375%, and which increased to LIBOR plus 6.75% from November 2017 until the closing date of the acquisition. In connection with the effectiveness of the 2017 Credit Facility, on June 30, 2017, we terminated our then outstanding financing facilities with affiliates of Deerfield Management Company, L.P. (""Deerfield""), which consisted of $25.0 million of subordinated convertible debt and up to $25.0 million of unsecured subordinated debt (the ""Deerfield Facility""). On August 9, 2017, we closed a sale-leaseback transaction with MedEquities Realty Operating Partnership, LP, a subsidiary of MedEquities Realty Trust, Inc. (""MedEquities""), for $25.0 million (""2017 Sale-Leaseback""), in which MedEquities purchased from our subsidiaries two drug and alcohol rehabilitation outpatient facilities and two sober living facilities: the Desert Hope Facility and Resolutions Las Vegas, each located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the Greenhouse Facility and Resolutions Arlington, each located in Arlington, Texas (collectively, the ""Sale-Leaseback Facilities""). Simultaneously with the sale of the Sale-Leaseback Facilities, we, through our subsidiaries, and affiliates of MedEquities entered into an operating lease, dated August 9, 2017 (the ""Lease""), in which we will continue to operate the Sale-Leaseback Facilities. The Lease provides for a 15-year term for each facility with two separate renewal terms of five years each if we choose to exercise our right to extend the lease term. The initial annual minimum rent payable to MedEquities pursuant to the Lease is $2.2 million due in equal monthly installments of $0.2 million. Due to the nature of the agreement between MedEquities and us, the transaction does not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP""). Therefore, the Sale-Leaseback Facilities will remain on our balance sheet and will continue to be depreciated over the life of the asset. We accounted for the $25.0 million of proceeds, less $0.4 million of transaction costs, as a financing obligation, of which $0.1 million was classified as a short-term liability. On a monthly basis, a portion of the payment is allocated to principal, which reduces the obligation balance, and interest, computed based on our incremental borrowing rate. Key Personnel Update Candance Henderson-Grice On February 3, 2017, Candance Henderson-Grice resigned as Chief Operating Officer of the Company. In connection with her resignation, she entered into a separation agreement and release, which provided for, among other things, aggregate payments of $0.6 million to be paid over the course of 2017. Jerrod Menz On September 8, 2017, Jerrod Menz resigned from the board of directors and as an employee of the Company for personal reasons. In connection with his resignation, he forfeited 50,000 shares of restricted stock and entered into a 24-month separation and release agreement with the Company in exchange for an aggregate payment of $0.7 million. Kirk Manz Effective December 31, 2017, Kirk Manz resigned as Chief Financial Officer of the Company. In connection with his resignation, on November 9, 2017, he entered into a separation agreement and release with the Company, which provided for, among other things, the payment of $0.5 million. Andrew McWilliams Effective January 1, 2018, Andrew McWilliams transitioned into the role of Chief Financial Officer of the Company, immediately following Mr. Manz's departure. Mr. McWilliams also retains his title as Chief Accounting Officer of the Company. Michael Nanko Effective January 15, 2018, Michael Nanko started in his role as President and Chief Operating Officer of the Company. Components of Results of Operations Client Related Revenue. Our client related revenue primarily consists of service charges related to providing addiction treatment and related services, including clinical diagnostic laboratory services. We recognize revenue at the estimated net realizable value in the period in which services are provided. For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 92.3% and 90.0%, respectively, of our client related revenue was reimbursable by commercial payors, including amounts paid by such payors to clients, with the remaining revenue payable directly by our clients. Given the scale and nationwide reach of our network of substance abuse treatment facilities, we generally have the ability to serve clients located across the country from any of our facilities, which allows us to operate our business and analyze revenue on a system-wide basis rather than focusing on any individual facility. Revenue concentration by payor remains modest. For the year ended December 31, 2017, no single payor accounted for more than 11.4% of our revenue, with the top three payors accounting for 32.6% of our revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2016, no single payor accounted for more than 10.5% of our revenue with the top three accounting for approximately 31.3% of our revenue. The following table summarizes the composition of our client related revenue for residential treatment facility services, outpatient facility and sober living services and client related diagnostic services for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016:  December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Increase (Decrease) Amount % Amount % Amount % Residential treatment facility services1 $ 246,976 80.0 % $ 189,502 70.0 % $ 57,474 30.3 % Outpatient facility and sober living services2 29,080 9.4 % 16,676 6.2 % 12,404 74.4 % Client related diagnostic services3 32,482 10.5 % 64,391 23.8 % (31,909 ) (49.6 %) Total client related revenue $ 308,538 100.0 % $ 270,569 100.0 % $ 37,969 14.0 %  (1) Residential treatment facility services and related professional services. (2) Outpatient facility services, related professional services and sober living services. (3) Client related diagnostic services, which includes point of care drug testing and client related diagnostic laboratory services. Client related diagnostic services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2017, decreased 49.6% to $32.5 million compared with $64.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Client related diagnostic services revenue as a percentage of total client related revenue was 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 23.8% for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in client related diagnostic services is a result of previously anticipated lower reimbursements combined with a shift in the mix of client related diagnostic services from higher reimbursed tests to lower reimbursed tests. We recognize client related revenue from commercial payors at the time services are provided based on our estimate of the amount that payors will pay us for the services performed. For in-network contracts, client related revenue is based on previously set contracted rates. We receive the majority of payments from commercial payors at out-of-network rates. We estimate the net realizable value of revenue by adjusting gross client charges using our expected realization and applying this discount to gross client charges. Our expected realization is determined by management after considering the type of services provided and the historical collections received from commercial payors, on a per facility basis, compared to gross client charges billed. Our accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts due from commercial payors. We do not recognize revenue for any amounts not collected from the client. From time to time, we may provide free care to clients, which we refer to as scholarships. We do not recognize revenue for any scholarships that we provide. Included in the aging of accounts receivable are amounts for which the commercial insurance company paid out-of-network claims directly to the client and for which the client has yet to remit the insurance payment to us (which we refer to as ""paid to client""). Such amounts paid to clients continue to be reflected in our accounts receivable aging as amounts due from commercial payors. Accordingly, our accounts receivable aging does not provide for the distinct identification of paid to client receivables. Also included in the aging of accounts receivable are amounts where we have received a partial payment from the commercial insurance company and are continuing to pursue additional collections for the estimated remaining balance outstanding. Non-Client Related Revenue. Our non-client related revenue consists of service charges from the delivery of quality targeted leads to behavioral and mental health service businesses and diagnostic laboratory services provided to clients of third-party addiction treatment providers. Non-client related revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the fee for services is fixed or determinable and collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses are primarily impacted by the following categories of expenses: Salaries, wages and benefits. We employ a variety of staff related to providing client care, including case managers, therapists, medical technicians, housekeepers, cooks and drivers, among others. Our clinical salaries, wages and benefits expense is largely driven by the total number of beds in our facilities, our average daily census (""ADC"") and the number of outpatient visits. We also employ a professional sales force and staff a centralized call center. Our corporate staff includes accounting, billing and finance professionals, marketing and human resource personnel, IT staff and senior management. Client related services. Client related services consist of physician and medical services as well as client meals, pharmacy, travel and various other expenses associated with client treatment. Client related services are significantly influenced by our ADC and the number of outpatient visits. Provision for doubtful accounts. The provision for doubtful accounts represents the expense associated with management's best estimate of accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future. We establish our provision for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the receivables, historical collection experience by facility, services provided, payor source and historical reimbursement rate, current economic trends and percentages applied to the accounts receivable aging categories. As of December 31, 2017, substantially all accounts receivable aged greater than 360 days were fully reserved in our consolidated financial statements. In assessing the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts, we rely on the results of detailed reviews of historical write-offs and recoveries on a twelve-month basis (the hindsight analysis) as a primary source of information to utilize in estimating the collectability of our accounts receivable. We supplement this hindsight analysis with other analytical tools, including, but not limited to, historical trends in cash collections compared to net revenue less bad debt and days sales outstanding. Advertising and marketing. We promote our treatment facilities through a variety of channels including television advertising, internet search engines and print advertising, among others. While we do not compensate our referral sources for client referrals, we do have arrangements with multiple marketing channels that we pay on a performance basis (i.e., pay per click or pay per inbound call). We also host and attend industry conferences. Our advertising and marketing efforts and expense is largely driven by the total number of available beds in our facilities. Professional fees. Professional fees consist of various professional services used to support primarily corporate related functions. These services include client billings and collections, accounting related fees for financial statement audits, tax preparation and legal fees for, among other matters, employment, compliance and general corporate matters. These fees also include information technology, consulting and payroll fees. Other operating expenses. Other operating expenses consist primarily of utilities, insurance, telecom, travel and repairs and maintenance expenses, and is significantly influenced by the total number of beds in our facilities and our ADC. Rentals and leases. Rentals and leases mainly consist of properties under various operating leases, which includes space required to perform client services and space for administrative facilities. Litigation settlement. Litigation settlement represents settlement funds and expenses incurred for activities undertaken in defense of the Company from claims and other legal matters or to resolve such matters. Depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization represents the ratable use of our capitalized property and equipment, including assets under capital leases, over the estimated useful lives of the assets, and amortizable intangible assets, which mainly consist of trademark-related intangibles and non-compete agreements. Acquisition-related expenses. Acquisition-related expenses consist primarily of professional fees and travel costs associated with our acquisition activities. Key Drivers of Our Results of Operations. Our results of operations and financial condition are affected by numerous factors, including those described under ""Risk Factors"" and those described below: Average Daily Residential Census. We refer to the average number of clients to whom we are providing services at our residential facilities on a daily basis over a specific period as our average daily residential census. Our revenue is directly impacted by our average daily residential census, which fluctuates based on the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, total number of effective beds, the number of client admissions and discharges in a period and the average length of stay. Average Daily Sober Living Census. We refer to the average number of clients to whom we are providing services at our sober living facilities on a daily basis over a specific period as our average daily sober living census. Our revenue is directly impacted by our average daily sober living census, which fluctuates based on the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts, total number of beds, the number of client admissions and discharges in a period and the average length of stay. Average Daily Residential Revenue and Average Net Daily Residential Revenue. Our average daily residential revenue is a per census metric equal to our total residential revenue, less clinical diagnostic services revenue, for a period divided by our average daily residential census for the same period divided by the number of days in the period. Our average net daily residential revenue is a per census metric equal to our total residential revenue, less clinical diagnostic services revenue, less the applicable provision for doubtful accounts for a period divided by our . . .

(3) DTX: Detoxification; RTC: Residential Treatment; PHP: Partial Hospitalization; IOP: Intensive Outpatient. (4) In August 2017, we relocated our Recovery First West Palm facility from West Palm Beach, Florida to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Following the relocation, we now have an 83-bed sober living facility and an outpatient center at Recovery First Fort Lauderdale East. (5) We have leased one floor from New Orleans East Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, where, as of October 9, 2017, we operate 36 beds to provide detoxification and residential treatment services. (6) In August 2017, we increased our sober living bed capacity by 48. (7) We acquired this property on February 24, 2015 and have begun development of a residential treatment center. The facility is currently anticipated to be completed by the end of 2018. (8) We are currently in the process of completing the conversion of Resolutions Arlington into sober living beds that will be used in support of the Greenhouse Outpatient Center. We began accepting sober living clients at the end of the third quarter of 2016 and currently have a total of 80 sober living beds. We currently anticipate completion of the remaining renovations by mid-year 2018, which will result in an additional 75 sober living beds. Recent Developments Pending Acquisition On September 13, 2017, we, together with AAC Healthcare Network, Inc., one of our wholly owned subsidiaries (""Buyer""), entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement (the ""Purchase Agreement"") with AdCare, Inc., a Massachusetts corporation (""AdCare""), and AdCare Holding Trust, a Massachusetts business trust (""AdCare Trust""). AdCare and its subsidiaries offer treatment of drug and alcohol addiction and own, among other things, a 114-bed hospital, five outpatient centers in Massachusetts, a 52-bed (46 currently licensed) residential treatment center and two outpatient centers in Rhode Island. We have agreed to acquire from AdCare Trust all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of AdCare in exchange for the following: (i) the payment by us of $70.0 million in cash, (ii) the delivery by us of such number of unregistered shares of our common stock (""Common Shares""), equal to $5.0 million divided by the average closing price per Common Share on the New York Stock Exchange during the ten (10) trading day period ending three (3) business days prior to the closing date (the ""Closing Stock Consideration""); and (iii) the delivery by us of a promissory note issued by us to AdCare Trust in the principal amount of $10.0 million (the ""Promissory Note""), for aggregate consideration of $85.0 million, subject to adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement. The cash portion of the acquisition is anticipated to be financed through a combination of proceeds from the issuance of an incremental term loan under the 2017 Credit Facility and cash on hand. The Promissory Note will mature no more than 91 days after the latest maturity date of the term loans under the 2017 Credit Facility, which are currently scheduled to mature on June 30, 2023, and will bear interest on the unpaid principal amount thereof at a fixed rate per annum equal to 5.0%, compounded annually. At closing, the Closing Stock Consideration will be deposited in escrow as security for potential post-closing indemnity claims (the ""Escrow Fund"") and $0.5 million in cash will be deposited in escrow for shortfalls in AdCare's net working capital. In addition, post-closing indemnity claims for certain matters will be affected first by a set off against the Promissory Note and, to the extent such claim for indemnification exceeds the then outstanding principal and interest due under the Promissory Note, any remaining claims will be paid from the Escrow Fund. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by the parties to such agreement, as well as customary indemnification provisions and termination rights for the parties. Further, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the parties have also agreed to customary covenants, including, among others, covenants relating to (i) the conduct of AdCare's business during the interim period between the execution of the Purchase Agreement and the completion of the acquisition; and (ii) obligations to obtain any consents, approvals, permits, or authorizations which are required to be obtained in order to complete the acquisition under any applicable federal or state laws or regulations. The acquisition is currently anticipated to close in the first half of 2018; however, we cannot assure you that the acquisition will be consummated by this date or at all. Financing For discussion of our 2017 Credit Facility, and a summary of its terms, see Note On June 30, 2017, we entered into a senior secured credit facility with Credit Suisse AG, as administrative agent for the lenders party thereto (the ""2017 Credit Facility""). The 2017 Credit Facility initially made available a term loan in the aggregate principal amount of $210.0 million (the ""2017 Term Loan"") and a $40.0 million revolving line of credit (the ""2017 Revolver""). The 2017 Credit Facility also provides for standby letters of credit in an aggregate undrawn amount not to exceed $7.0 million. We incurred approximately $12.9 million in debt issuance costs related to underwriting and other professional fees, of which $7.6 million related to the 2017 Term Loan and $5.3 million related to the 2017 Revolver. We used the proceeds to repay $205.4 million of certain existing indebtedness under the 2015 Credit Facility and the Deerfield Facility (as further described below). On September 25, 2017, we entered into an Incremental Loan Assumption Agreement (the ""Incremental Agreement""), with the Incremental Revolving Credit Lenders (as defined in the Incremental Agreement), Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, as administrative agent (""Credit Suisse""), and the other Loan Parties (as defined in the Incremental Agreement) party thereto, relating to the 2017 Credit Facility. The Incremental Agreement provided for an increase in our existing revolving line of credit from $40.0 million to $55.0 million. On October 6, 2017, in conjunction with our pending acquisition of AdCare, we also secured a $65.0 million incremental term loan commitment in conjunction with our 2017 Credit Facility, subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory provisions. In connection with the financing, we committed to a ticking fee that commenced on October 17, 2017, at a rate of LIBOR plus 3.375%, and will increase to LIBOR plus 6.75% for November 2017 through the closing date of the acquisition. The 2017 Term Loan is scheduled to mature in June 2023, bears interest at LIBOR plus 6.75% per annum (with a 1.0% floor) or Alternative Base Rate (as defined in the 2017 Credit Facility) plus 5.75% per annum and has incremental borrowing ability subject to certain consents and conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from lenders. The 2017 Revolver is scheduled to mature in June 2022, and bear interest at LIBOR plus 6.00% per annum or Alternative Base Rate plus 5.00% per annum. The 2017 Credit Facility reduced covenant restrictions and increased borrowing capacity as compared to the 2015 Credit Facility and the Deerfield Facility. In connection with the effectiveness of the 2017 Credit Facility, on June 30, 2017, we terminated our then outstanding financing facilities with affiliates of Deerfield Management Company, L.P. (""Deerfield""), which consisted of $25.0 million of subordinated convertible debt and up to $25.0 million of unsecured subordinated debt (the ""Deerfield Facility""). On August 9, 2017, we closed a sale-leaseback transaction with MedEquities Realty Operating Partnership, LP, a subsidiary of MedEquities Realty Trust, Inc. (""MedEquities""), for $25.0 million (""2017 Sale-Leaseback""), in which MedEquities purchased from our subsidiaries two drug and alcohol rehabilitation outpatient facilities and two sober living facilities: the Desert Hope Facility and Resolutions Las Vegas, each located in Las Vegas, Nevada, and the Greenhouse Facility and Resolutions Arlington, each located in Arlington, Texas (collectively, the ""Sale-Leaseback Facilities""). Simultaneously with the sale of the Sale-Leaseback Facilities, we, through our subsidiaries, and MedEquities entered into an operating lease, dated August 9, 2017, in which we will continue to operate the Sale-Leaseback Facilities. The operating lease provides for a 15-year term for each facility with two separate renewal terms of five years each if we choose to exercise our right to extend the lease term. The initial annual minimum rent payable MedEquities is $2.2 million due in equal monthly installments of $0.2 million. On the first, second and third anniversary of the lease date, the annual rent will increase to an amount equal to 101.5% of the annual rent in effect for the immediately preceding year. On the fourth anniversary of the lease date and thereafter during the lease term, the annual rent will increase to the amount equal to the CPI Factor (as defined in the Lease) multiplied by the annual rent in effect for the immediately preceding year; provided, however, that the adjusted annual rent will never be less than an amount equal to 101.5% or greater than an amount equal to 103.0% of the annual rent in effect for the immediately preceding year. Due to the nature of the agreement between MedEquities and us, the transaction does not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting under GAAP. Therefore, the Sale-Leaseback Facilities will remain on our balance sheet and will continue to be depreciated over the life of the asset. We accounted for the $25 million of proceeds, less $0.4 million of transaction costs, as a financing obligation, of which $0.2 million was classified as a short-term liability. On a monthly basis, a portion of the payment is allocated to principal, which reduces the obligation balance, and interest, computed based on our incremental borrowing rate. The lease with MedEquities is accounted for as an operating lease under GAAP. Facility Updates In August 2017, we relocated our Recovery First West Palm facility from West Palm Beach, Florida to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. By relocating Recovery First West Palm closer to our Fort Lauderdale facility, we expect to gain additional operational efficiencies. Effective July 31, 2017, we voluntarily closed our remaining beds at our Forterus facility in order to consolidate our southern California operations closer to Laguna Treatment Hospital. By consolidating our operations closer to Laguna Treatment Hospital, we expect to gain additional operational efficiencies. As a result of closing the beds at Forterus, we had a net reduction in bed count of 37. As our residential daily census at Laguna Treatment Hospital grows, we expect to add additional sober living beds and outpatient services near our Laguna Treatment Hospital. From May 23, 2017 to July 5, 2017, our Sunrise House facility was temporarily not serving clients due to an employee strike at that location. On June 14, 2017, a settlement was reached with the union, and Sunrise House began readmitting clients on July 5, 2017. As a result of our Sunrise House facility entering into a three-year collective bargaining agreement with the Health Professionals and Allied Employees labor union on June 14, 2017, a majority of our employees at Sunrise House are now represented by a collective bargaining agreement. On October 9, 2017, we opened Townsend Recovery Center New Orleans where we have leased one floor from New Orleans East Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana and operate 36 beds to provide detoxification and residential treatment services. Components of Results of Operations Client Related Revenue. Our client related revenue primarily consists of service charges related to providing addiction treatment and related services, including clinical diagnostic laboratory services. We recognize revenue at the estimated net realizable value in the period in which services are provided. For the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, approximately 92.5% and 93.3%, respectively, of our client related revenue was reimbursable by commercial payors, including amounts paid by such payors to clients, with the remaining revenue payable directly by our clients. Given the scale and nationwide reach of our network of substance abuse treatment facilities, we generally have the ability to serve clients located across the country from any of our facilities, which allows us to operate our business and analyze revenue on a system-wide basis rather than focusing on any individual facility. Revenue concentration by payor remains modest. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, no single payor accounted for more than 12.2% and 11.3% of our revenue, respectively, and for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016, no single payor accounted for more than 11.7% and 11.0% of our revenue, respectively. The following table summarizes the composition of our client related revenue for residential treatment facility services, outpatient facility and sober living services, and client related diagnostic services, which includes point-of-care drug testing and clinical diagnostic laboratory services, for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016:  Three Months Ended Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 September 30, 2016 (unaudited) (unaudited) Amount % Amount % Residential treatment facility services1 $ 64,237 82.4 $ 48,692 71.1 Outpatient facility and sober living services2 8,085 10.4 5,032 7.3 Client related diagnostic services3 5,626 7.2 14,767 21.6  (1) Residential treatment facility services and related professional services. (2) Outpatient facility services, related professional services and sober living services. (3) Client related diagnostic services, which includes point of care drug testing and client related diagnostic laboratory services. Client related diagnostic services revenue for the three months ended September 30, 2017 decreased 61.9% to $5.6 million compared with $14.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. Client related diagnostic services revenue as a percentage of total client related revenues was 7.2% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to 21.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease in client related diagnostic services is a result of previously anticipated lower reimbursements combined with a shift in the mix of client related diagnostic services from higher cost tests to lower cost tests. We recognize client related revenues from commercial payors at the time services are provided based on our estimate of the amount that payors will pay us for the services performed. We estimate the net realizable value of revenue by adjusting gross client charges using our expected realization and applying this discount to gross client charges. Our expected realization is determined by management after taking into account the type of services provided and the historical collections received from commercial payors, on a per facility basis, compared to gross client charges billed. Our accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts due from commercial payors. We do not recognize revenue for any amounts not collected from the client. From time to time, we may provide free care to clients, which we refer to as scholarships. We do not recognize revenues for scholarships provided. Included in the aging of accounts receivable are amounts for which the commercial insurance company paid out-of-network claims directly to the client and for which the client has yet to remit the insurance payment to us (which we refer to as ""paid to client""). Such amounts paid to clients continue to be reflected in our accounts receivable aging as amounts due from commercial payors. Accordingly, our accounts receivable aging does not provide for the distinct identification of paid to client receivables. Also included in the aging of accounts receivable are amounts where we have received a partial payment from the commercial insurance company and are continuing to pursue additional collections for the estimated remaining balance outstanding. Non-Client Related Revenue. Our non-client related revenue consists of service charges from the delivery of quality targeted leads to behavioral and mental health service businesses through our operating subsidiary Referral Solutions Group, LLC (""RSG""), and diagnostic laboratory services provided to clients of third-party addiction treatment providers. Non-client related revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the fee for services is fixed or determinable and collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. . . .

These statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors that may cause our actual results and performance to be materially different from the information contained in the forward-looking statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, without limitation: (i) our inability to operate our facilities; (ii) our reliance on our sales and marketing program to continuously attract and enroll clients; Overview We are a provider of inpatient and outpatient substance abuse treatment services for individuals with drug and alcohol addiction. In connection with our treatment services, we perform drug testing and diagnostics laboratory services and provide physician services to our clients. As of March 31, 2017, we operated 12 residential substance abuse treatment facilities located throughout the United States, focused on delivering effective clinical care and treatment solutions across 1,370 beds, including 656 licensed detoxification beds, 18 standalone outpatient centers, and three sober living facilities with an aggregate 242 sober living beds. In the near term, we are expanding our Oxford Treatment Center, having opened an additional 24 residential beds in April 2017 and currently anticipate completing 48 sober living beds in the third quarter of 2017. We also leased one floor of the New Orleans East Hospital in New Orleans, Louisiana, where we plan to operate 36 in-network beds to provide detoxification and residential treatment services. Our New Orleans East Hospital is anticipated to open mid-year 2017, subject to receiving licensure. We are also an internet marketer in the addiction treatment industry operating a broad portfolio of internet assets that service millions of website visits each month. Through our websites, such as Rehabs.com and Recovery.org, we serve families and individuals struggling with addiction and seeking treatment options through comprehensive online directories of treatment providers, treatment provider reviews, forums and professional communities. Recovery Brands also provides online marketing solutions to other treatment providers such as enhanced facility profiles, audience targeting, lead generation and tools for digital reputation management. The majority of our approximately 2,000 employees as of March 31, 2017 are highly trained clinical staff who deploy research-based treatment programs with structured curricula for detoxification, residential treatment, partial hospitalization and intensive outpatient care. By applying a tailored treatment program based on the individual needs of each client, many of whom require treatment for a co-occurring mental health disorder, such as depression, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, we believe we offer the level of quality care and service necessary for our clients to achieve and maintain sobriety.

The beds are expected to be operational by mid-year 2017, subject to receiving licensure, and will be operated by the Townsend clinical staff. (6) In April 2017, we opened an additional 24 beds licensed for detoxification and currently anticipate opening 48 sober living beds in the third quarter of 2017. (7) We acquired this property on February 24, 2015 and have begun development of a residential treatment center. The facility is currently anticipated to be completed mid-year 2018. (8) We are currently in the process of completing the conversion of Resolutions Arlington into sober living beds that will be used in support of the Greenhouse Outpatient Center. We began accepting sober living clients at the end of the third quarter of 2016 and currently have a total of 80 sober living beds. We currently anticipate completion of the remaining renovations by the end of 2017, which will result in an additional 75 sober living beds. Recent Developments Financing For discussion of our five-year senior secured credit facility with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent for the lenders party thereto (the ""2015 Credit Facility""), and a summary of its terms, see Note 9 to the accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements. As of March 31, 2017, under our 2015 Credit Facility, we had $33.0 million outstanding under our revolver, $116.4 million outstanding on our term loan and $2.5 million in standby letters of credit issued for various corporate purposes. On February 27, 2017, we amended our 2015 Credit Facility to, among other things, provide for certain modifications to the terms of our Credit Agreement, dated as of March 19, 2015, as amended from time to time (the ""2015 Credit Agreement""), including the following: (i) extend the maximum Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) of 4.25:1.00 through the measurement period ending September 30, 2017; and (ii) amend the definition of Applicable Margin (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) to add an additional pricing level of 3.75% for Eurodollar Rate Loans and Letter of Credit Fee, 2.75% for Base Rate Loans and 0.60% for Commitment Fee (as all such terms are defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement), which will be applicable when the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio is equal to or exceeds 4.00:1.00 at the end of the applicable measuring period (the ""New Pricing Level"") and to provide that the Applicable Rate (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) be set at the New Pricing Level from the date of such amendment until the first business day following the date we deliver our next Compliance Certificate (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement). The amendment also provided for additional Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the 2015 Credit Agreement) add backs under its covenant calculation to account for its February 2017 reduction in workforce. The 2015 Credit Facility is scheduled to mature in March 2020 and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin between 2.25% to 3.75% or a base rate plus a margin between 1.25% and 2.75%, in each case depending on the Company's leverage ratio. The 2015 Credit Facility has an accordion feature that provides for an additional $75.0 million of borrowing capacity under the 2015 Credit Facility, subject to certain consents and conditions, including obtaining additional commitments from lenders. Components of Results of Operations Client Related Revenue. Our client related revenue primarily consists of service charges related to providing addiction treatment and related services, including the collection and laboratory testing of urine for controlled substances. We recognize revenue at the estimated net realizable value in the period in which services are provided. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, approximately 91% and 90%, respectively, of our client related revenue were reimbursable by commercial payors, including amounts paid by such payors to clients, with the remaining revenue payable directly by our clients. Given the scale and nationwide reach of our network of substance abuse treatment facilities, we generally have the ability to serve clients located across the country from any of our facilities, which allows us to operate our business and analyze revenue on a system-wide basis rather than focusing on any individual facility. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, no single payor accounted for more than 10.8% and 13.1% of our revenue reimbursements, respectively. The following table summarizes the composition of our client related revenue for residential treatment facility services, outpatient facility and sober living services, and client related diagnostic services, which includes point-of-care drug testing and diagnostic laboratory services, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016:  2017 (unaudited) 2016 (unaudited) Amount % Amount % Residential treatment facility services1 $ 49,495 69.5 $ 44,713 71.3 Outpatient facility and sober living services2 5,715 8.0 1,905 3.0 Client related diagnostic services3 16,009 22.5 16,088 25.7 Total client related revenue $ 71,219 100.0 $ 62,706 100.0  (1) Residential treatment facility services and professional services. (2) Outpatient facility services, professional services and sober living services. (3) Client related diagnostic services, which includes point of care drug testing and client related diagnostic laboratory services. We recognize client related revenues from commercial payors at the time services are provided based on our estimate of the amount that payors will pay us for the services performed. We estimate the net realizable value of revenue by adjusting gross client charges using our expected realization and applying this discount to gross client charges. Our expected realization is determined by management after taking into account the type of services provided and the historical collections received from the commercial payors, on a per facility basis, compared to the gross client charges billed. Our accounts receivable primarily consists of amounts due from commercial payors. Any client self-pay portion is usually collected upon admission, and in limited circumstances, the client will make a deposit and negotiate the remaining payments as part of the services. We do not recognize revenue for any amounts not collected from the client in either of these situations. From time to time, we may provide free care to clients, which we refer to as scholarships. We do not recognize revenues for scholarships provided. Included in the aging of accounts receivable are amounts for which the commercial insurance company paid out-of-network claims directly to the client and for which the client has yet to remit the insurance payment to us (which we refer to as ""paid to client""). Such amounts paid to clients continue to be reflected in our accounts receivable aging as amounts due from commercial payors. Accordingly, our accounts receivable aging does not provide for the distinct identification of paid to client receivables. Also included in the aging of accounts receivable are amounts where we have received a partial payment from the commercial insurance company and are continuing to pursue additional collections for the estimated remaining balance outstanding. Non-Client Related Revenue. Our non-client related revenue consists of service charges from the delivery of quality targeted leads to behavioral and mental health service businesses through our operating subsidiary Referral Solutions Group, LLC (""RSG""), and diagnostic laboratory services provided to clients of third-party addiction treatment providers. Non-client related revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, services have been rendered, the fee for services is fixed or determinable and collectability of the fee is reasonably assured. Operating Expenses. Our operating expenses are primarily impacted by nine categories of expenses: salaries, wages and benefits; client related services; provision for doubtful accounts; advertising and marketing; professional fees; other operating expenses; rentals and leases; depreciation and amortization; and acquisition-related expenses. Salaries, wages and benefits. We employ a variety of staff related to providing client care, including case managers, therapists, medical technicians, housekeepers, cooks and drivers, among others.

This change in presentation will reduce revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and is not expected to have an effect on net income or earnings per share.  AAC is revising its guidance for the full year 2018 to include AdCare from the March 1, 2018 acquisition date. Results for 2018 full year guidance as set forth below have been provided for the 10 months inclusive of ASC 606, and for comparability only, 2018 full year guidance has also been provided excluding the impact of ASC 606 (dollars in millions, except share data):   Full Year 2018 Revised Guidance   As CurrentlyReported  Adjusted forAdoption of ASC 606on January 1, 2018 Total Revenues  $360 - $375  $325 - $340 Residential treatment facility revenue  $285 - $290  $262 - $266 Outpatient and sober living facility revenue  $44 - $50  $40 - $46 Client related diagnostic services revenue (includes point of caredrug testing and client related diagnostic laboratory servicesrevenue)  $18 - $21  $12 - $15 Non-client related revenue (includes third-party marketing,laboratory services and criminal justice services)  $13 - $14  $11 - $13      Adjusted EBITDA  $68 - $72  $68 - $72 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Common Share  $0.75 - $0.80  $0.75 - $0.80 AAC expects an annual effective tax rate of 24% to 26% and diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding of approximately 24.5 million for the year. This outlook above does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, transaction-related costs, litigation settlement or expenses related to legal defenses. With respect to the ""2018 Revised Outlook"" above, reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted common share guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts. This inability results from the inherent difficulty in forecasting generally and quantifying certain projected amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations. In particular, sufficient information is not available to calculate certain adjustments required for such reconciliations, including de novo start-up and other expense and acquisition-related expenses. We expect these adjustments may have a potentially significant impact on future GAAP financial results. ***** About American Addiction Centers American Addiction Centers is a leading provider of inpatient and outpatient substance abuse treatment services.

The Company's reported numbers exceeded analysts' expectations by $11.11 million. During Q2 FY18, Phibro's gross profit of $66.9 million, jumped 5% from $63.5 million in Q2 FY17. The Company's gross profit decreased to 32.5% of net sales for the reported quarter compared to 33.1% for the prior year's same quarter. Phibro's Q2 FY18 results included $1.4 million of acquisition-related cost of goods sold. For Q2 FY18, Phibro's selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) of $43.0 million, increased 5% from $40.9 million in Q2 FY17. The Company's SG&A for the reported quarter included $1.7 million in costs relating to the partial settlement of the pension plan. For Q2 FY18, Phibro's adjusted EBITDA of $32.5 million grew 4% compared to $31.2 million in Q2 FY17. Phibro's net income was $7.0 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, for Q2 FY18 compared to net income of $13.4 million, or $0.34 per diluted share, for Q2 FY17. The decrease in earnings was primarily due to a $8.3 million increase in income tax expense. Phibro's adjusted earnings were $0.44 per share for Q2 FY18, up 12.8% compared to $0.39 per share in Q2 FY17. Higher gross profit, lower interest expense, net, and a lower effective income tax rate were the primary contributors to the improvement. The Company's earnings beat Wall Street's estimates of $0.39 per share. Phibro Animal Health's Segment Results During Q2 FY18, the Animal Health segment's net sales of $132.8 million advanced 7% compared to $123.7 million in Q2 FY17, primarily due to volume increases across all product groups within the segment. Within the Animal Health division, Nutritional specialty products jumped 12% to $32.6 million on a y-o-y basis, primarily due to volume growth of its products for the dairy and poultry industries in the United States and by penetration into various international countries. The segment's Vaccines sales rose 7% to $18.2 million, primarily due to volume growth in international markets. The segment's MFA sales gained 6% to $82.0 million. Excluding the effects of the acquisition-related cost of goods sold, Animal Health's gross profit increased $3.9 million on a y-o-y basis due to volume growth, higher average selling prices on selected products, and lower unit costs from improved operating efficiencies. Animal Health's adjusted EBITDA for the reported quarter edged up 1% to $35.0 million on a y-o-y basis, due to sales growth and increased gross profit. For Q2 FY18, the Mineral Nutrition segment's net sales totaled $59.6 million reflecting growth of 5% compared to $56.7 million in Q2 FY17. The increased revenue was due to favorable product mix, plus higher average selling prices resulting from underlying raw material commodity price increases. Mineral Nutrition gross profit increased $0.9 million on a y-o-y basis due to favorable product mix and higher average selling prices. Mineral Nutrition adjusted EBITDA advanced 18% to $5.6 million on a y-o-y basis. During Q2 FY18, the Performance Products segment's net sales surged 19% to $13.4 million compared to $11.2 million in Q2 FY17, due to higher average selling prices of copper-based products and higher volumes of copper-based and personal care products. The segment's adjusted EBITDA was similar to the prior year's same quarter at $0.3 million as higher volumes and selling prices were offset by higher product costs. Cash Matters Phibro had $67 million cash and short-term investments on hand at December 31, 2017. The Company had 2.6x leverage ratio at December 31, 2017, with total debt of $318 million.

""Of course, delivering excellent clinical client care remains our top focus, and our effectiveness in executing against this vision is illustrated in the recent findings of our 12-month clinical outcomes study and in investments we are making in clinical and other technology to further improve client experiences, safety and outcomes."" Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results AAC breaks down its revenues between client related revenue and non-client related revenue. Client related revenue includes: (1) residential treatment facility services and related professional services; (2) outpatient facility services, related professional services and sober living services; and (3) client related diagnostic services, which includes point of care drug testing and client related diagnostic laboratory services. Non-client related revenue includes marketing and diagnostic services provided to third parties. Prior period results have been conformed to the current period presentation. Total revenue increased 19% to $86.1 million compared with $72.4 million in the same period in the prior year. Residential treatment facility revenue increased 40% to $71.5 million compared with $51.2 million in the same period in the prior year.

Outpatient and sober living facility revenue increased 59% to $9.0 million compared with $5.7 million in the same period in the prior year.

Client related diagnostic services revenue was down 78% to $3.1 million compared with $14.2 million in the same period in the prior year. The decrease in client related diagnostic services is a result of previously anticipated lower reimbursements combined with a shift in the mix of client related diagnostic services from higher reimbursed tests to lower reimbursed tests. Non-client related revenue increased 104% to $2.5 million compared with $1.2 million in the same period in the prior year. Net loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders was $18.8 million, or ($0.80) per diluted common share, compared with net income available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders of $0.5 million, or $0.02 per diluted common share, in the prior-year period. Included in the net loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders is the accrued litigation liability of $23.3 million, or ($0.70) per diluted common share, related to the estimated settlement of the Tennessee class action litigation and the Nevada derivative litigation matters. Also included in the net loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders is a non-cash increase in the Company's provision for income taxes of $3.5 million, or ($0.15) per diluted common share, related to the estimated impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on the net deferred tax assets. These estimates may be refined as further information becomes available. Adjusted EBITDA increased 35% to $15.1 million compared with $11.1 million for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted net income available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders decreased to $2.4 million, or $0.10 per diluted common share, compared with $3.4 million, or $0.15 per diluted common share, for the same period in the prior year.

Tables reconciling these non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are included at the end of this release.

ARV increased 19% to $403 compared with $339 in the prior year. Client related diagnostic services revenue was down 50% to $32.5 million compared with $64.4 million in the prior year. As is the case with fourth quarter results, this decrease is the result of previously anticipated lower reimbursements combined with a shift in the mix of client related diagnostic services from higher reimbursed tests to lower reimbursed tests. Non-client related revenue decreased 1% to $9.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $9.2 million in the in the prior year.

Included in the net loss available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders is an accrued litigation liability of $23.3 million, or ($0.70) per diluted common share, and the non-cash increase in the Company's provision for income taxes of $3.5 million, or ($0.15) per diluted common share, outlined above. Adjusted EBITDA increased 20% to $57.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared with $47.7 million for the prior year. Adjusted net income available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders decreased to $13.9 million, or $0.60 per diluted common share, compared with $16.2 million, or $0.71 per diluted common share, for the same period in the prior year. Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders and adjusted diluted earnings per share are non-GAAP financial measures.

Cash flows provided by operations totaled $5.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with cash flows used in operations of $1.2 million in the prior year period. Capital expenditures in the fourth quarter of 2017 totaled $5.9 million. Days sales outstanding continue to improve and were 101 days for the fourth quarter of 2017 compared with 106 days for the third quarter of 2017 and 111 for the prior-year period. Total cash collections increased 15% for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. 2018 Outlook In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) Topic 606, ""Revenue from Contracts with Customers,"" a replacement of Revenue Recognition Topic 605. The Company adopted ASC 606 on January 1, 2018. Under ASC 606, the majority of the provision for doubtful accounts, which historically was reported as an operating expense, will now be reported as a direct reduction to revenue in 2018. This change in presentation will reduce revenues and operating expenses by the same amount and is not expected to have an effect on net income or earnings per share.  AAC introduces its guidance for the full year 2018 in the table below. Results for 2018 full year guidance have been provided inclusive of ASC 606, and for comparability only, 2018 full year guidance has also been provided excluding the impact of ASC 606 (dollars in millions, except share data):   Full Year 2018 Guidance   As Currently Reported  Adjusted for Adoption of ASC 606 on January 1, 2018 Total Revenues  $325 - $335  $290 - $300 Residential treatment facility revenue  $258 - $260  $234 - $236 Outpatient and sober living facility revenue  $38 - $42  $35 - $39 Client related diagnostic services revenue (includes point of care drug testing and client related diagnostic laboratory services revenue)  $18 - $21  $12 - $15 Non-client related revenue (includes third-party marketing and laboratory services)  $11 - $12  $9 - $10      Adjusted EBITDA  $62 - $65  $62 - $65 Adjusted Earnings per Diluted Common Share  $0.70 - $0.75  $0.70 - $0.75 The Company expects an annual effective tax rate of 24% to 26% and diluted weighted-average common shares outstanding of approximately 24 million for the year. This outlook above does not include the impact of any future acquisitions, including the pending acquisition of AdCare, transaction-related costs, litigation settlement or expenses related to legal defenses. With respect to the ""2018 Outlook"" above, reconciliation of adjusted EBITDA and adjusted earnings per diluted common share guidance to the closest corresponding GAAP measure on a forward-looking basis is not available without unreasonable efforts. This inability results from the inherent difficulty in forecasting generally and quantifying certain projected amounts that are necessary for such reconciliations. In particular, sufficient information is not available to calculate certain adjustments required for such reconciliations, including de novo start-up and other expense and acquisition-related expenses. We expect these adjustments may have a potentially significant impact on future GAAP financial results.

Management believes the Non-GAAP Disclosures provide investors with additional meaningful financial information that should be considered when assessing our underlying business performance and trends. We believe the Non-GAAP Disclosures also enhance investors' ability to compare period-to-period financial results.  The Non-GAAP Disclosures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""). The items excluded from the Non-GAAP Disclosures are significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other financial statement items presented in the condensed consolidated financial statements. Because the Non-GAAP Disclosures are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, the Non-GAAP Disclosures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies.   Management defines adjusted EBITDA as net income (loss) available to AAC Holdings, Inc. common stockholders adjusted for interest expense, depreciation and amortization expense, income tax benefit, net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest, stock-based compensation and related tax reimbursements, litigation settlement and California matter related expense, acquisition-related expense (which includes professional services for accounting, legal, valuation services and licensing expenses), de novo start-up and other expenses, employee severance expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, gain on contingent consideration and facility closure operating losses and expense.

AAC,"NASHVILLE, Tenn., Feb. 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- American Addiction Centers (AAC) is breaking new ground in addiction treatment with the release of its first patient outcome studies. AAC is joining the ranks of only a handful of national treatment centers to measure outcomes and publicly share the findings. Utilizing three years of tracking and research, with the assistance of Centerstone Research Institute (CRI), the studies analyzed how treatment at AAC facilities impacted the lives of patients. Results indicate that 63 percent of AAC patients maintain abstinence one year after treatment, as compared to national benchmarks of 30 percent. ""The treatment industry hasn't done a good job of proving that treatment really works,"" says Michael Cartwright, CEO, American Addiction Centers. ""That's why we felt it was critical for American Addiction Centers, as a leader in the industry, to invest in patient outcome studies. Our findings show our treatment model is making a difference in the lives of our patients, even months after treatment ends. We are also using this new data to improve our services as part of our ongoing commitment to clinical excellence."" CRI enrolled more than 4,000 patients as part of the main study. They were tracked from intake to discharge and then at two, six, and 12 months. The researchers looked at several outcome measures, including substance use, co-occurring medical problems, mental health challenges, family problems, and employment and legal issues. ""Addiction is a chronic disease that affects every aspect of a person's life, from family functioning to mental and physical health,"" says Dr. Tom Doub, AAC's Chief Clinical and Compliance Officer. ""We wanted to analyze those aspects as well in determining the effectiveness of our treatment model. It turns out our comprehensive approach made a significant difference in patients' overall quality of life."" Some key findings from the 12-month follow up substudy include: At 12 months, 63% of patients were abstinent from all substances. Days of alcohol use, which was the most reported issue, decreased by 80% 12 months after completing treatment Days of heroin use decreased by 88% Total days with significant family conflict decreased by 87% Days experiencing physical health problems decreased by 44% Days with mental health problems, like depression or anxiety, decreased 56% ""At AAC, our mission is to transform lives,"" says Doub. ""One of the major barriers to families seeking help is lack of confidence in treatment outcomes. These studies clearly demonstrate that treatment works. Not only does it work to reduce substance use, but it also has significant benefits across many important areas of life."" AAC already has plans for phase two of the study. The goal is to expand on the initial study and to also analyze the impact that treatment makes on reducing other healthcare costs such as emergency room visits and hospitalizations.  ""Our ultimate goal is to revolutionize the treatment of addiction so we can save more lives,"" says Cartwright. ""We won't stop until we get there. This is one giant step towards helping us achieve our vision.""

AAC,"BRENTWOOD, Tenn., Nov. 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- In honor of Veteran's Day, American Addiction Centers (AAC) is providing 30 days of free inpatient care to five members of the armed forces who are struggling with drug and/or alcohol addiction. ""No one is immune from addiction,"" said American Addiction Centers CEO Michael Cartwright. ""This disease does not discriminate and even our nation's heroes can fall victim."" Alcohol and substance use disorder are prevalent among veterans and active-duty military, and PTSD is often an underlying component. According to the National Center for PTSD, about two out of 10 veterans who suffer from PTSD go on to develop substance use disorder.  ""Someone suffering from what they've done serving this country, and were willing to die for it, does not deserve to be on the streets drinking out of a bag,"" said Jay Russell, a veteran and treatment coordinator for American Addiction Centers. Based on the unique experiences of veterans and other first responders, AAC has developed a research-based program dedicated to addressing their particular needs. The First Responder Lifeline Program is offered at several AAC facilities. ""We have a first responders hotline unlike anyone else in the industry,"" said Mike Blackburn, Senior VP of Business Development. ""Due to the nature of their line of work, this population requires specialized care dealing with trauma, PTSD, etc. We have special phone numbers that are answered by clinically trained firefighters, police, veterans and other first responders who have a deep understanding of what the person on the line is going through."" According to Russell, the offer of treatment is especially needed around the holiday. ""Every Veteran's Day, we get a few urgent calls, and I make sure that I'm there helping to ensure that they get the help they need,"" said Russell. ""When we say, 'no man left behind,' we mean it, and that rule applies even if the uniform is off."" American Addiction Centers also launched an employee campaign in recognition of Veteran's Day to raise funds to support those veterans impacted by the recent hurricanes in the Caribbean to  providing housing and other basic needs. AAC currently partners with the VA Caribbean Healthcare System to place Puerto Rico veterans into treatment at its facility Recovery First in Florida.

Andrew McWilliams, who currently serves as the company's Chief Accounting Officer, will be appointed Chief Financial Officer immediately following Manz's departure.  After over a 15-year career with Ernst & Young LLP, Mr. McWilliams joined AAC in August 2014 to assist with the company's initial public offering and to build a public company accounting and finance department. During his tenure with Ernst & Young, Mr. McWilliams served multiple healthcare clients and also gained experience across a variety of corporate transactions, including debt financings and public equity offerings, as well as and mergers and acquisitions.

Kirk also played a pivotal role in securing the AdCare acquisition which we currently anticipate will add an additional $50 million in annual revenue.  I am grateful to Kirk for his significant contributions, and I am proud of all that we have accomplished together since we started on this journey back in 2011.  Kirk's business and financial expertise has been critical to our strategic initiatives, M&A activity and capital funding.  He has guided us through nine residential and outpatient real estate projects totaling $125 million, nine acquisitions totaling $250 million, and over $700 million in financial transactions, including our public offering in 2014.  AAC has relied on Kirk's business knowledge, integrity and hard work, and he will leave AAC well-positioned to build on our accomplishments in the future.  I wish Kirk the very best in his future endeavors and, on behalf of our Board and everyone at AAC, we thank him for his outstanding service."" Mr. Cartwright added, ""I am very pleased that Andrew McWilliams will transition into the role of CFO upon Kirk's departure. Since joining our organization in 2014, Andrew has built an exceptional accounting and finance department and has played a critical role in managing the day-to-day financial responsibilities of AAC.  Andrew will continue to work closely with Kirk to ensure a smooth transition of responsibilities. I am highly confident in Andrew's ability to help AAC achieve our strategic and financial objectives going forward.  We are off to a solid start in the fourth quarter of 2017.
