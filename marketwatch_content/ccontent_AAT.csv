AAT,"It appears inflation is rearing its ugly head, and one thing that investors can do to take advantage of a change in the economy is to buy some small-cap stocks for their portfolio. On Friday, Rex Nutting questioned whether Federal Reserve Chairwoman Janet Yellen might be ignoring signs of inflation, but concluded that “there’s no urgency to raise rates on account of hyperinflation lurking right around the corner.” But Michael Brush believes investors need to see beyond the “headline” inflation rate, “which looks relatively tame at 1.4%, since it’s pushed down by weak oil and commodities,” and focus on the core inflation rate, which recently hit 2.2%. He went on to outline the reasons a tighter labor market and rising wages can lead to significantly higher inflation. Brush then listed several sectors that stock investors should consider in a rising inflation environment, including the materials, agricultural and financial sectors. “Also consider small-cap companies. They’re leaner than large-cap companies, so higher prices bring superior earnings leverage,” Brush added. The S&P SmallCap 600 Index SML, +0.99%  has returned 1.4% so far this year, slightly ahead of the 0.8% return for the large-cap S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38% Over the past 12 months through Friday, the small-caps have underperformed, as you can see here: FactSet With Brush’s comments in mind, we thought it would be useful to look at RBC Capital Markets’ U.S. Equity Small-Cap Focus List and Outlook report published Thursday.

AAT,"Getty Images In honor of our nation’s 238th birthday, we have put together a big list of publicly traded companies whose names include the words “America” or “United States,” or any abbreviation or combination of the two. Whimsical? A bit. Silly? Certainly not. Any arbitrary method of producing a decent-sized list of publicly traded companies is sure to highlight some quality stocks for further inspection. We began with the components of the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% the S&P MidCap 400 MID, +1.35%   and the S&P SmallCap 600 SML, +0.99%  and added a list of U.S. energy stocks supplied by FactSet. We then pared the list to companies with any version of the nation’s name, with market values of at least $100 million. That left us with 47 stocks. The 20 listed above had an average total return of 20% during the first half of the year, which was nearly triple the total return of the benchmark S&P 500 Index. The financial sector is best represented on the list, with real estate investment trusts, big banks and insurance companies. There are also plenty of oil and gas stocks, and a few utilities. What follows is a brief discussion for each of the 20 best “American” stock performers during the first half of 2014. You can click on each company’s name to see current stock quotes and lists of articles mentioning the company. U.S. Silica Holdings Inc. SLCA, +0.51%  of Frederick, Md., was the top-performing “American” stock, with a total return of 63.5% through Monday’s close. The company provides silicate products for use in oil and gas production, and manufacturing. It has grown its annual sales per share for four straight years. The stock rose 9% on April 29 after the company reported a 45% increase in sales of sand used in hydraulic fracturing. “We are currently sold out of all grades of frac sand and believe that industry demand growth will continue to outpace planned supply additions,” CEO Bryan Shinn said in the company’s earnings release. U.S. Silica expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for 2014 to increase to a range of $180 million to $200 million from $160.8 million in 2013. The stock closed at $55.44 on Monday, and trades for 19.1 times the consensus 2015 earnings estimate of $2.91 a share, among analysts polled by FactSet, up from an estimated $1.97 this year. Skechers USA Inc. SKX, +1.38%  of Manhattan Beach, Calif., ranks a distant second with a total return of 38%. The footwear maker reported a 21% increase in first-quarter sales to $546.5 million, as earnings more than quadrupled to $31 million, or 61 cents a share. The stock closed at $45.70 Monday and trades for 17.3 times the consensus 2015 EPS estimate of $2.64. The 2014 EPS estimate is $2.16. Shares of PharMerica Corp. US:PMC  of Louisville, Ky., returned 33% to close at $28.59. The company provides generic drugs to hospitals and health-care facilities. First-quarter revenue grew 3% to $452.2 million, and the gross profit margin slipped to 18% from 19% a year earlier. CEO Greg Weishar, in the earnings release May 1, reiterated the company’s plan to deploy operating cash flow “to enhance gross margins.” Reynolds American Inc. US:RAI  of Winston-Salem, N.C., is the second-largest cigarette maker in the U.S., and its stock has returned 24% this year to $60.35, assuming dividends were reinvested. Tobacco stock are cash plays, and Reynolds American boasts a dividend yield of 4.44%. First-quarter sales grew 2.8% to $1.94 billion, while rising costs for marketing its Vuse digital-vapor cigarettes lowered adjusted operating income (excluding litigation and other extraordinary expenses) by 1.4% to $555 million. The adjusted operating margin narrowed to 34.4% from 36.6%. The good news included increased market share for all four of the company’s key brands, including Camel, Pall Mall, Grizzly and Natural American Spirit. American Electric Power Co. AEP, -0.10%  of Columbus, Ohio, generates electricity and operates a regulated utility servicing 3.5 million customers in 11 states. The stock returned 22% to $55.77, and has a dividend yield of 3.59%. Please see 10 laggard stocks that could get a huge M&A premium for coverage of the remarkable runup of electric utility stocks this year. American Campus Communities Inc. ACC, +0.13%  of Austin, Texas, is a real estate investment trust that mainly owns and manages student housing. The stock returned 21% to close at $38.24. The REIT pays a quarterly dividend of 38 cents for a yield of 3.97%. Because of their focus on cash flow, equity REITs report funds from operations (FFO) in addition to GAAP earnings. Revenue for the first quarter rose 12% from a year earlier to $183.2 million, while FFO increased to $73.8 million, or 69 cents a share, from $68.5 million, or 64 cents. Plains All American Pipeline L.P. PAA, +1.94%  of Houston operates crude oil, natural gas and refined product pipelines in the U.S. and Canada. The stock returned 19% to $60.05. There are several energy limited partnerships listed here, and for convenience we’re referring to limited partnership units as “shares.” For more on the tax advantages and reporting requirements for LP investments, as well as the potential for high income, please see five dividend stocks with yields up to 10%. Plains All American shares have a yield of 4.20%. American Water Works Co. AWK, +1.16%  of Voorhees, N.J., provides water and wastewater services through a regulated segment that serves customers in 16 states, and through a market operations segment that builds and maintains facilities for the U.S. military, municipalities and corporate customers. The stock returned 19% to $49.45, and has a dividend yield of 2.51%. First-quarter earnings were $68.1 million, or 38 cents a share, increasing from $57.6 million, or 32 cents, a year earlier. But if expenses from a chemical spill in West Virginia were excluded, net income would have been $71.7 million, or 40 cents. Murphy USA Inc. MUSA, +1.11%  of El Dorado, Ark., is a refiner that also runs over 1,200 gas stations in the country. The company was spun off from Murphy Oil Corp. MUR, +1.85%  last year. Murphy USA’s stock returned 18% at $48.89. The company reported a 4% year-over-year decline in first-quarter revenue to $4.16 billion, reflecting “a challenging wholesale environment.” But Murphy USA’s convenience stores showed much better results, as non-tobacco sales grew 5.3%, and the margin on these products increased by 10%. Net income was $9.6 million, or 21 cents a share, down from $22 million, or 47 cents, a year earlier. American States Water Co. AWR, +1.03%  of San Dimas, Calif., provides water and wastewater utility services in 10 California counties and has a smaller electricity utility business and a contract business that operates water systems at military installations. The stock returned 17% in the first half, closing at $33.23. The company last month announced an increase in its quarterly dividend, and the shares now yield 2.56%. First-quarter operating revenue was down 8% to $101.9 million, mainly because of a 32% drop in contracted services revenue, which had been expected as projects at two bases were completed. The company expects contract revenue to increase over the rest of the year. Net income was $11 million, or 28 cents a share, down from $13.5 million, or 35 cents, a year earlier. Cash America International Inc. US:CSH  of Forth Worth, Texas, operates over 800 pawn shops in the nation, most of which offer consumer-lending services as well. The company has nearly 50 foreign locations. The stock returned 16%, closing at $44.43 on Monday. Cash America’s first-quarter earnings grew to $45.7 million, or $1.55 a share, from $43.9 million, or $1.40, a year earlier. U.S. Energy Corp. USEG, +0.64%  of Riverton, Wyo., has various oil and gas production properties in the U.S. The stock returned 15% to $4.33. First-quarter revenue totaled $8.3 million, up 5% from a year earlier, as oil and gas sales increased. Net income was $250,000, or a penny a share, improving from a net loss of $5.9 million, or 21 cents, a year earlier. Packaging Corp. of America PKG, +1.37%  of Lake Forest, Ill., provides paper and corrugated packaging used in various industries. The company also sells newsprint to publishers. The stock returned 14% to $71.49, and has a dividend yield of 2.24%. First-quarter net sales were up 90% to $1.43 billion, which included the acquisition of Boise Inc. Earnings came in at $90 million, or 92 cents a share, increasing from $62 million, or 64 cents, during the first quarter of 2013. A lawsuit settlement and integration costs lowered profits by $16 million. American Tower Corp. AMT, +0.72%  of Boston is a real estate investment trust focusing on acquiring and leasing land used for wireless and broadcast operations. The stock returned 14% to $89.98, and has a dividend yield of 1.51%. The REIT reported a 23% year-over-year increase in first-quarter revenue to $984.1 million, while adjusted funds from operations (FFO) were up 21% to $493.3 million. Alon USA Partners LP US:ALDW  of Dallas is a subsidiary of Alon USA Energy Inc. US:ALJ that completed its initial public offering in November 2012. The main business of the partnership is to operate a crude oil refinery in Big Spring, Texas. The shares returned 14% to close at $17.93. The partnership makes a variable quarterly distribution, so it can be volatile. Total distributions based on 2013 operations came to $2.37 a share. Net income was $42.2 million, or 68 cents a share, compared with $93.5 million, or $1.50, a year earlier. The results show the vagaries of the market for refined fuel. The first-quarter operating margin was $14.77 per barrel, about half that of a year earlier. Aqua America Inc. WTR, +1.40%  of Bryn Mawr, Pa., is the third water utility on this list, with operations in eight states. The shares returned 12.5% to $26.22, and have a dividend yield of 2.32%. The company reported a 2% increase in first-quarter operating revenue to $182.7 million amid “one of the toughest winters in decades.” Net income was $42.9 million, or 24 cents a share, compared with $46.6 million, or 23 cents, a year earlier. Primerica Inc. PRI, -0.31%  of Duluth, Ga., is a life-insurance company that distributes financial products in the U.S. and Canada. The stock returned 12% to $47.85. That followed a 45% return during 2013, which was a very strong recovery year for the life-insurance sector, as investors anticipated an eventual rise in interest rates. First-quarter operating revenue rose 9% to $324 million, while net income increased to $45.1 million, or 81 cents a share, from $38.8 million, or 65 cents, a year earlier. Laboratory Corp. of America Holdings LH, +0.14%  of Burlington, N.C. — better known as LabCorp — operates clinical laboratories and provides services at 1,700 patient centers worldwide. The stock returned 12% to $102.40. LabCorp reported first-quarter earnings of $113.5 million, or $1.31 a share, down from $147.2 million, or $1.56, a year earlier, hurt by severe winter weather. Sales were down 1% to $1.431 billion. Despite the difficult first quarter, LabCorp raised its guidance for 2014. American Assets Trust Inc. AAT, -1.99%  of San Diego is a REIT that acquires and develops commercial and multifamily property mainly in California and Hawaii. The stock returned 11% to close at $34.55, and the dividend yield is 2.55%. First-quarter funds from operations attributable to common stock totaled $22.9 million, or 39 cents a share, increasing from 21.4 million, or 37 cents, a year earlier. American Midstream Partners LP AMID, +4.85%  of Denver operates natural gas pipelines and provides other transportation and storages services mainly on the Gulf Coast and in southeastern states. The stock returned 10% to close at $28.84 on Monday. Based on the most recent quarterly distribution, the shares have a dividend yield of 6.41%.

AAT,"Our database shows that insiders have recently fallen for stocks ranging from natural gas producer Chesapeake CHK, +1.00% to security systems company ADT ADT, +4.34% According to economic theory, it is rational for investors to diversify their wealth; one implication of this theory is that company insiders should avoid buying stock and therefore increasing their company-specific risk. An exception to this rule would occur if the insider is particularly confident in the stock's prospects, so insider purchases should be more likely to occur under that condition; in fact, studies generally show a small outperformance effect for insider purchases (read our analysis of studies on insider trading). Therefore we think that it can be a good idea to track what insiders are up to and see if any of their buys make for good stock picks. Read on for our quick take on five stocks insiders have bought recently. An insider bought 8,000 shares of Chesapeake between August 5th and 6th. After struggling with liquidity issues and a poor natural gas market last year, the exploration and production company has sold off some of its assets and Wall Street analysts expect enough improvement on the bottom line next year that the forward P/E is 12. Chesapeake may be depending on higher natural gas prices for that to happen, however, and 12% of the float is held short as many market players are bearish. In addition to insider purchases, we also track quarterly 13F filings from hundreds of hedge funds and other notable investors. We've found that the information in 13Fs can be useful in developing investment strategies; for example, the most popular small cap stocks among hedge funds generate an average excess return of 18 percentage points per year (learn more about our small cap strategy). Our own portfolio based on this strategy outperformed the S&P 500 by 33 percentage points since inception 11 months ago. We can also track interest in individual stocks through this database, and can see that billionaire Carl Icahn (who had bought a stake in Chesapeake last year) owned almost 60 million shares at the end of March. As we'd mentioned, ADT has also been a target of recent insider purchases. The company was spun out in order to be a pure-play home and business security and monitoring company; many investors like to invest in spinout situations on the theory that management becomes more able to focus on operations without having to consider the needs of the parent company. Read more about investing in spinouts. The stock started off strong after becoming publicly traded last October but has since declined to the point that it has underperformed the S&P 500. ADT is valued at 20 times forward earnings estimates. A Board member at Hercules Technology Growth Capital HTGC, +0.67% which primarily provides debt and equity to new ventures and private equity backed companies, was buying the stock at prices of around $14.60 per share. The company recently increased its dividend to 27 cents per share- a level at which the yield is over 7%- though it does tend to invest in somewhat risky securities to go with this high return. It is also fairly cheap in earnings terms, however, with a trailing P/E of 12, and might be worth a look from income investors. Amy Minella, John Overdeck, and Alec Litowitz are among HTGC shareholders. Trucking company Old Dominion Freight Line ODFL, +3.42% also makes our list of stocks with recent insider purchases. Old Dominion carries trailing and forward P/Es of 20 and 16, respectively, so markets are pricing in moderate to high earnings growth for the next several years. In fact, the company's last quarterly report shows a 9% rise in revenue compared with the second quarter of 2012 with net income up by 22%. Billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group reported a position of 1.4 million shares in its most recent 13F (find Griffin's favorite stocks). The executive chairman of office-focused real-estate investment trust American Assets Trust AAT, -1.99% recently bought 2,000 shares of stock. The company primarily owns and invests in property in California. It has been making quarterly dividend payments of 21 cents per share since shortly after going public in early 2011 (the stock has gained over 50% since then). As a real-estate investment trust, American Assets Trust must distribute a large share of taxable income to shareholders in order to preserve its tax status.

AAT, -1.99% (the ""company"") today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Financial Results and Recent Developments Net income available to common stockholders of $7.1 million and $29.1 million for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, or $0.15 and $0.62 per diluted share, respectively Funds From Operations (""FFO"") decreased 4% and increased 4% year-over-year to $0.46 and $1.92 per diluted share for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Reaffirming 2018 FFO annual guidance range of $2.01 to $2.09 per diluted share Same-store cash NOI decreased 2.1% and 0.2% for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Leased approximately 20,000 comparable office square feet at an average GAAP-basis and cash-basis contractual rent increase of 21% and 11%, respectively, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 Leased approximately 45,000 comparable retail square feet at an average GAAP-basis contractual rent and cash-basis contractual rent increase of 52% and 35%, respectively, during the three months ended December 31, 2017 Credit facility amended and restated to increase the revolving line of credit, extend maturity date and decrease credit spreads Term loan agreement amended to decrease credit spreads Net income attributable to common stockholders was $7.1 million, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to $8.9 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended December 31, 2016. The decrease from the corresponding period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense at Lloyd District Portfolio and increase in general and administrative expenses during the period related to a one-time non-cash charge associated with the vesting modification of previously granted restricted stock awards. The vesting modification was approved by our compensation committee during the fourth quarter of 2017 to adjust vesting based on their analysis of our relative total shareholder return over a three year period instead of our prior performance metric of relative forward FFO multiple. For the year ended December 31, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $29.1 million, or $0.62 per basic and diluted share compared to $32.6 million, or $0.72 per basic and diluted share for the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense attributed to the acquisition of the Pacific Ridge Apartments on April 28, 2017 and an increase in general and administrative expenses, as previously noted. During the fourth quarter of 2017, the company generated funds from operations (""FFO"") for common stockholders of $29.6 million, or $0.46 per diluted share, compared to $30.5 million, or $0.48 per diluted share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The decrease in FFO from the corresponding period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense and general and administrative expenses during the period, as noted above. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the company generated FFO for common stockholders of $123.2 million, or $1.92 per diluted share, compared to $116.8 million, or $1.85 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The increase in FFO from the prior year was primarily due to additional operating income from Hassalo on Eighth due to an increase in the percentage leased, the acquisitions of the Pacific Ridge Apartments on April 28, 2017 and Gateway Marketplace on July 6, 2017, offset by the increase in general and administrative expenses during the period, as noted above. FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the company considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.

On a same-store GAAP basis, retail NOI for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the corresponding period in 2016. On a same-store cash basis, retail NOI for the three months ended December 31, 2017 increased from the prior period due to higher annualized base rents at Carmel Mountain Plaza and Del Monte Center. On a same-store GAAP and cash basis, retail NOI for the year ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the prior year. On a same-store GAAP basis, office NOI decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016 primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense for a tenant at the Lloyd District Portfolio. On a same-store cash basis, office NOI decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016 primarily due to rent abatements at First & Main and City Center Bellevue. On a same-store GAAP and cash basis, office NOI increased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016 due to higher annualized base rents, specifically at the Lloyd District Portfolio, the Landmark at One Market and First & Main. On a same-store GAAP and cash basis, multifamily NOI increased for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding periods in 2016 primarily due to an increase in average monthly base rent during 2017. This increase was achieved notwithstanding the current repositioning of 21 off-line units at Loma Palisades, which was recently completed at the end of the fourth quarter of 2017. On a same-store GAAP basis, mixed-use NOI for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was consistent with the corresponding period in 2016. On a same-store cash basis mixed-use NOI decreased for the three months ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the percentage leased at the retail portion of our mixed-use property. On a same-store GAAP and cash basis, mixed-use NOI decreased for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016 primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property and a decrease in the percentage leased at the retail portion of our mixed-use property.

Reported results are preliminary and not final until the filing of the company's Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, remain subject to adjustment. Use of Non-GAAP Information Funds from Operations The company calculates FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. Cash Net Operating Income The company uses cash net operating income (""NOI"") internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the company's properties. The company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the company's properties as this measure is not affected by (1) the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, (2) the cost of funds of the property owner, (3) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (4) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the company's properties but does not measure the company's performance as a whole. Cash NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP. Cash NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of lease incentives and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other nonproperty income and losses, acquisition-related expense, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the company's cash NOI may not be comparable to the cash NOIs of other REITs. About American Assets Trust, Inc.

AAT,"Dec 15, 2017 (3BL Media via COMTEX) -- SOURCE:Tetra Tech In the midst of a population boom, Portland is in need of more residential space. With the city's current infrastructure not able to keep up with that need, new private developments have to accommodate a growing population without damaging the surrounding environment. Hassalo on Eighth was conceived as an EcoDistrict--a series of buildings that share sustainable energy, water, and waste infrastructure--to ease the city's housing squeeze, revitalize a neighborhood in need of development, and allow its tenants to reduce their carbon footprint by nearly a third. GBD Architects selected Glumac, A Tetra Tech Company, to provide mechanical, electrical, and plumbing; lighting; and low-voltage design, as well as energy analysis and fundamental commissioning for this development. The development focuses on water reclamation to reduce the increased strain the city's wastewater and rainwater systems place on the Willamette River, which runs directly though Portland. Hassalo on Eighth included an advanced central water design built around a natural wastewater treatment system, which is known as the Natural Organic Recycling Machine (NORM). Glumac teamed with GBD, Biohabitats, PLACE, Puttman Infrastructure, and American Assets Trust to develop NORM, which cleans sewage using bacteria in an artificial tidal wetland that appears as typical planting beds in the landscape between each building. It has the potential to transform up to 54,000 gallons of sewage into reusable gray water daily. The gray water is then used onsite in toilet flushing, cooling, and irrigation, with any available excess used for groundwater recharge. NORM also helps this development ease strain on Portland's outdated rainwater and wastewater treatment system, where thousands of gallons of wastewater flush into the Willamette River during heavy rains. Glumac's mechanical team designed the central condenser water loop that connects all four buildings' mechanical systems, facilitating thermal energy sharing throughout the district. In addition, Glumac designed the upgrade to the central utility plant in the existing, onsite 16-story commercial building to extend the electrical, chilled water, and heated water production to service all commercial spaces in the development's three new buildings. In addition, Glumac's lighting studio provided photometric and shading analysis for advanced lighting design, which features daylight dimming switches in each building to maximize natural lighting features and LED luminaries throughout the development to provide greater occupant control and energy efficiency. Our team conducted energy modeling to determine effective systems design to achieve LEED Platinum certification. Our low-voltage experts designed video surveillance, access control systems, and telecommunications infrastructure. Glumac's commissioning group also provided Fundamental LEED Commissioning, monitoring the design and development of the cooling tower system, water-cooled chiller, boilers, and rainwater and graywater harvesting systems to ensure they were designed to ownership expectations. Based on the savings gained in water, sewer, and system development charges, the Hassalo on Eighth water system will pay for itself in four years. All three residential buildings on the site have achieved U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) LEED v4 Triple Platinum certification.

Financial Results and Recent Developments Net income available to common stockholders of $9.1 million and $22.0 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, or $0.19 and $0.47 per diluted share, respectively Funds From Operations increased 11% and 7% year-over-year to $0.52 and $1.46 per diluted share for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Quarterly dividend increased 4% to $0.27 per share of common stock for the fourth quarter of 2017 Decreasing 2017 annual guidance to a range of $1.99 to $2.01 of FFO per diluted share, an 8% increase over 2016 FFO per diluted share Introducing 2018 annual guidance range of $2.01 to $2.09 per diluted share, a 3% increase over the revised 2017 annual guidance midpoint Same-store GAAP NOI increased 4% and 2% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Same-store cash NOI decreased 0.3% and increased 0.5% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Leased approximately 69,000 comparable office square feet at an average GAAP-basis and cash-basis contractual rent increase of 15% and 10%, respectively, during the three months ended September 30, 2017 Leased approximately 24,000 comparable retail square feet at an average GAAP-basis contractual rent increase of 8% and cash- basis contractual rent decrease of 1% during the three months ended September 30, 2017 Acquisition of Gateway Marketplace in Chula Vista, California Net income attributable to common stockholders was $9.1 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $8.5 million, or $0.19 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The increase from the corresponding period in 2016 was primarily due to growth in same-store net operating income from our existing portfolio. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $22.0 million, or $0.47 per basic and diluted share compared to $23.7 million, or $0.52 per basic and diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease from the corresponding period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense attributed to the acquisition of the Pacific Ridge Apartments on April 28, 2017. During the third quarter of 2017, the company generated funds from operations (""FFO"") for common stockholders of $33.6 million, or $0.52 per diluted share, compared to $29.8 million, or $0.47 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the company generated FFO for common stockholders of $93.6 million, or $1.46 per diluted share, compared to $86.3 million, or $1.37 per diluted share, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The increase in FFO from the corresponding periods in 2016 was primarily due to additional operating income from Hassalo on Eighth due to an increase in the percentage leased, the acquisitions of the Pacific Ridge Apartments on April 28, 2017 and Gateway Marketplace on July 6, 2017 and growth in same-store net operating income from our existing portfolio. FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the company considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.

Same-Store Property Operating Income For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, same-store property GAAP basis operating income increased 3.7% and 1.6%, respectively, and same-store property cash basis operating income decreased 0.3% and increased 0.5%, respectively, compared to the corresponding periods in 2016.The same-store property operating income by segment was as follows (in thousands):   Three Months Ended (1)         Nine Months Ended (2)         September 30,         September 30,         2017   2016   Change   2017   2016   Change GAAP Basis:                           Retail $ 18,745     $ 17,831     5.1   %   $ 54,465     $ 54,068     0.7   % Office 18,781     17,675     6.3       46,543     44,031     5.7     Multifamily 3,451     3,236     6.6       10,055     9,595     4.8     Mixed-Use 7,106     7,647     (7.1 )     18,480     19,865     (7.0 )     $ 48,083     $ 46,389     3.7   %   $ 129,543     $ 127,559     1.6   % Cash Basis:                           Retail $ 18,286     $ 18,318     (0.2 ) %   $ 53,741     $ 54,224     (0.9 ) % Office 18,386     18,085     1.7       45,329     43,181     5.0     Multifamily 3,451     3,236     6.6       10,055     9,595     4.8     Mixed-Use 6,998     7,615     (8.1 )     18,327     19,783     (7.4 )     $ 47,121     $ 47,254     (0.3 ) %   $ 127,452     $ 126,783     0.5   %                             (1) Same-store portfolio excludes (i) Hassalo on Eighth - Multifamily, which became available for occupancy in July and October of 2015; (ii) Hassalo on Eighth - Retail, which was placed in operations in April, July and October of 2016; (iii) the Pacific Ridge Apartments, which was acquired on April 28, 2017; (iv) Gateway Marketplace, which was acquired on July 6, 2017; and (v) land held for development. (2) Same-store portfolio excludes (i) Torrey Reserve Campus due to significant redevelopment activity during the period; (ii) Hassalo on Eighth - Multifamily, which became available for occupancy in July and October of 2015; (iii) Hassalo on Eighth - Retail, which was placed in operations in April, July and October of 2016; (iv) the Pacific Ridge Apartments, which was acquired on April 28, 2017; (v) Gateway Marketplace, which was acquired on July 6, 2017; and (vi) land held for development.  On a same-store GAAP basis, retail property operating income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 primarily due to higher annualized base rents and additional cost reimbursements at Lomas Santa Fe Plaza and Alamo Quarry Market and a decrease in bad debt expense at Waikele Center attributed to the Sports Authority bankruptcy. On a same-store cash basis, retail property operating income decreased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same periods in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the percentage leased at Waikele Center attributed to the Sports Authority bankruptcy. On a same-store basis, office property operating income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the corresponding periods in 2016 primarily due to higher annualized base rents, specifically at The Lloyd District Portfolio, The Landmark at One Market and First & Main. On a same-store basis, multifamily property operating income increased for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the corresponding periods in 2016 primarily due to an increase in average monthly base rent during 2017. This increase was achieved notwithstanding the current repositioning of 21 off-line units at Loma Palisades, which is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2017. On a same-store basis, mixed-use property operating income decreased for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to lower revenue per available room at the hotel and an increase in room expenses at the hotel attributed to an increase in occupancy during the quarter. On a same-store basis, mixed-use property operating income decreased for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016 due to an increase in bad debt expense at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property. Development We are finalizing our development efforts at Torrey Point and completed our construction of two Class A office buildings of approximately 88,000 square feet in the aggregate, with panoramic unobstructed views of the Torrey Pines State Park Beach, Torrey Reserve and the Pacific Ocean during the third quarter of 2017. Projected costs of the development at Torrey Point remain approximately $56 million, of which approximately $38 million has been incurred to date. We expect to incur the remaining costs for development of Torrey Point in 2017 and 2018 as we continue to lease space in the buildings. We expect the Torrey Point development to be stabilized in 2018 with an estimated stabilized cash yield of approximately 7% to 8%. Our development opportunities are subject to market conditions and actual results may vary. Acquisitions On July 6, 2017, we acquired Gateway Marketplace, an approximately 128,000 square feet dual-grocery anchored shopping center located in Chula Vista, California. The purchase price was approximately $42 million, funded with a combination of cash on hand and funds drawn against the company's existing credit facility. Gateway Marketplace is strategically located at the heart of Chula Vista's retail core on a highly trafficked intersection, across the street from (and synergistic to) our Southbay Marketplace and easily accessible to San Diego's major highways, I-5 and I-805. Major tenants at Gateway Marketplace include Smart & Final, Aldi, Hobby Lobby, Party City and Mattress Firm. Private Placement of Notes On July 19, 2017, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement for the private placement of $100 million of 3.78% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series F, due July 19, 2024 (the ""Series F Notes""). The Series F Notes were issued on July 19, 2017 and will pay interest semi-annually on the 31st of January and July until their respective maturities. Net of the settlement of a treasury lock, the fixed economic interest rate for the Series F Notes is approximately 3.85% per annum, through maturity. Balance Sheet and Liquidity At September 30, 2017, the company had gross real estate assets of $2.6 billion and liquidity of $344.2 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $94.2 million and $250.0 million of availability on its line of credit. Dividends The company declared dividends on its shares of common stock of $0.26 per share for the third quarter of 2017. The dividends were paid on September 28, 2017. In addition, the company has declared a dividend on its common stock of $0.27 per share for the quarter ending December 31, 2017, which is a 4% increase over the prior quarterly dividend of $0.26 per share. The dividend will be paid on December 21, 2017 to stockholders of record on December 7, 2017. Guidance The company decreased its guidance range for full year 2017 FFO per diluted share of $1.99 to $2.01 per share from the prior guidance range of $2.00 to $2.06 per share. Additionally, the company is introducing its initial guidance range for a full year 2018 FFO per diluted share of $2.01 to $2.09 per share, an increase of 3% from the revised 2017 annual guidance midpoint. The company's 2018 guidance is impacted by the repositioning of Waikele Center, the re-tenanting of City Center Bellevue and the remaining lease up of our Torrey Point development. Furthermore, the company's guidance excludes any impact from future acquisitions, dispositions, equity issuances or repurchases, future debt financings or repayments. Management will discuss the company's guidance in more detail on tomorrow's earnings call. The foregoing estimates are forward-looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to leasing activity, rental rates, occupancy levels, interest rates, credit spreads and the amount and timing of acquisition and development activities. The company's actual results may differ materially from these estimates.

Reported results are preliminary and not final until the filing of the company's Form 10-Q with the Securities and Exchange Commission and, therefore, remain subject to adjustment. Use of Non-GAAP Information Funds from Operations The company calculates FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. Cash Net Operating Income The company uses cash net operating income (""NOI"") internally to evaluate and compare the operating performance of the company's properties. The company believes cash NOI provides useful information to investors regarding the company's financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level, and when compared across periods, can be used to determine trends in earnings of the company's properties as this measure is not affected by (1) the non-cash revenue and expense recognition items, (2) the cost of funds of the property owner, (3) the impact of depreciation and amortization expenses as well as gains or losses from the sale of operating real estate assets that are included in net income computed in accordance with GAAP or (4) general and administrative expenses and other gains and losses that are specific to the property owner. The company believes the exclusion of these items from net income is useful because the resulting measure captures the actual revenue generated and actual expenses incurred in operating the company's properties as well as trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. Cash NOI is a measure of the operating performance of the company's properties but does not measure the company's performance as a whole. Cash NOI is therefore not a substitute for net income or operating income as computed in accordance with GAAP. Cash NOI, is a non-GAAP financial measure of performance. The company defines cash NOI as operating revenues (rental income, tenant reimbursements, lease termination fees, ground lease rental income and other property income) less property and related expenses (property expenses, ground lease expense, property marketing costs, real estate taxes and insurance), adjusted for non-cash revenue and operating expense items such as straight-line rent, amortization of lease intangibles, amortization of lease incentives and other adjustments. Cash NOI also excludes general and administrative expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, other nonproperty income and losses, acquisition-related expense, gains and losses from property dispositions, extraordinary items, tenant improvements, and leasing commissions. Other REITs may use different methodologies for calculating cash NOI, and accordingly, the company's cash NOI may not be comparable to the cash NOIs of other REITs. About American Assets Trust, Inc.

AAT, -1.99% (the ""company"") today reported financial results for its second quarter ended June 30, 2017. Financial Results and Recent Developments Net income available to common stockholders of $5.5 million and $12.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, or $0.12 and $0.28 per diluted share, respectively Funds From Operations increased 9% and 6% year-over-year to $0.49 and $0.94 per diluted share for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Same-store GAAP NOI increased 2% and 1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Same-store cash NOI increased 3% and 1% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, compared to the same periods in 2016 Leased approximately 88,700 comparable office square feet at an average GAAP-basis and cash-basis contractual rent increase of 47% and 33%, respectively, during the three months ended June 30, 2017 Leased approximately 207,000 comparable retail square feet at an average GAAP-basis contractual rent increase of 5% and cash-basis contractual rent decrease of 13% during the three months ended June 30, 2017 Entered into first office lease at Torrey Point for approximately 32,000 square feet, or 36% of the new development's rentable square footage Acquisition of the Pacific Ridge Apartments in San Diego, California Acquisition of Gateway Marketplace in Chula Vista, California subsequent to quarter end Net income attributable to common stockholders was $5.5 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to $7.6 million, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, net income attributable to common stockholders was $12.9 million, or $0.28 per basic and diluted share compared to $15.3 million, or $0.34 per basic and diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders from the corresponding periods in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense attributed to the acquisition of the Pacific Ridge Apartments on April 28, 2017. During the second quarter of 2017, the company generated funds from operations (""FFO"") for common stockholders of $31.7 million, or $0.49 per diluted share, compared to $28.3 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the company generated FFO for common stockholders of $59.9 million, or $0.94 per diluted share, compared to $56.5 million, or $0.89 per diluted share, for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The increase in FFO from the corresponding periods in 2016 was primarily due to additional operating income from Hassalo on Eighth due to an increase in the percentage leased, the acquisition of the Pacific Ridge Apartments on April 28, 2017 and growth in same-store net operating income from our existing portfolio. FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the company considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance. A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.

On a same-store basis, retail property operating income decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to a decrease in the percentage leased at Waikele Center attributed to the Sports Authority bankruptcy. On a same-store basis, office property operating income increased for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to higher annualized base rents, specifically at The Lloyd District Portfolio, First & Main and One Beach Street. On a same-store basis, multifamily property operating income increased for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the corresponding periods in 2016 primarily due to an increase in average monthly base rent during 2017. This increase was achieved notwithstanding the current repositioning of 21 off-line units at Loma Palisades, which is expected to be complete by the fourth quarter of 2017. On a same-store basis, mixed-use property operating income decreased for the six months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016 due to an increase in bad debt expense at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property. Development Our development efforts at Torrey Point are nearing completion with plans including two Class A office buildings of approximately 88,000 square feet in the aggregate, with panoramic unobstructed views of the Torrey Pines State Park Beach, Torrey Reserve and the Pacific Ocean. Projected costs of the development at Torrey Point remain approximately $56 million, of which approximately $37 million has been incurred to date. We expect to incur the remaining costs for development of Torrey Point in 2017. We expect the Torrey Point development to be stabilized in 2018 with an estimated stabilized cash yield of approximately 7% to 8%. On July 1, 2017, we signed a ten-year triple net lease for approximately 32,000 square feet at Torrey Point. Rent is expected to commence during the first quarter of 2018. Our development opportunities are subject to market conditions and actual results may vary. Acquisitions On April 28, 2017, we acquired the Pacific Ridge Apartments, a 533 unit luxury apartment community located in San Diego, California that was completed in 2013 and is approximately 92% leased as of July 31, 2017. The purchase price was approximately $232 million, funded with a combination of cash on hand and funds drawn against the Company's existing credit facility. The property is perched atop a bluff offering unobstructed panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean with an unparalleled amenities package and designed with a large focus on environmental sustainability. The property's central location in San Diego provides residents with convenient access to the light rail systems, extending residents reach to downtown, the San Diego International Airport, the San Diego Zoo, sporting venues, numerous malls and retail centers, culinary destinations and the freeway and public transportation. Additionally, the property is adjacent to the University of San Diego and in close proximity to two other universities.

The purchase price was approximately $42 million, excluding closing costs and prorations. The property was acquired with cash on hand and borrowings under our credit facility.

Guidance The company reaffirms its guidance for full year 2017 FFO per diluted share range of a range of $2.00 to $2.06 per share. The company's guidance excludes any impact from future acquisitions, dispositions, equity issuances or repurchases, future debt financings or repayments.

Use of Non-GAAP Information The company calculates FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO. Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. About American Assets Trust, Inc. American Assets Trust, Inc.

AAT, -1.99% (the ""company"") today reported financial results for its first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Financial Results and Recent Developments Net income available to common stockholders of $7.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, or $0.16 per diluted share Increasing 2017 annual guidance to a range of $2.00 to $2.06 of FFO per diluted share Funds From Operations decreased 2% year-over-year to $0.44 per diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 Same-store GAAP and cash NOI decreased 1.2% and 1.6%, respectively, to $41.9 million and $41.0 million, respectively, for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 Leased approximately 92,000 comparable office square feet at an average GAAP-basis and cash-basis contractual rent increase of 7% and 4%, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 Leased approximately 33,100 comparable retail square feet at an average GAAP-basis and cash-basis contractual rent increase of 10% and 2%, respectively, during the three months ended March 31, 2017 Acquisition of the Pacific Ridge Apartments, a 533 unit, luxury apartment community in San Diego, California Net income attributable to common stockholders was $7.4 million, or $0.16 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to $7.7 million, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share for the three months ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in net income attributable to common stockholders from the corresponding period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense during the three months ended March 31, 2017 attributed to the acceleration of debt costs associated with the pay off of the Waikiki Beach Walk - Retail mortgage and the private placement of $250 million of 4.29% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series D issued on March 1, 2017.  The decrease in net income is also attributed to an increase in bad debt expense at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property. During the first quarter of 2017, the company generated funds from operations (""FFO"") for common stockholders of $28.2 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared to $28.1 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in FFO from the corresponding period in 2016 was primarily due to an increase in interest expense and bad debt expense as noted above. FFO is a non-GAAP supplemental earnings measure which the company considers meaningful in measuring its operating performance.  A reconciliation of FFO to net income is attached to this press release.

On a same-store cash basis, office property operating income increased for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016 primarily due to higher annualized base rents, specifically at The Lloyd District Portfolio and City Center Bellevue. On a same-store basis, multifamily property operating income increased for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding periods in 2016 primarily due to an increase in average monthly base rent during 2017. On a same-store basis, mixed-use property operating income decreased for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period in 2016 due to an increase in bad debt expense at the hotel portion of our mixed-use property. Development Our development efforts at Torrey Point are ongoing with plans including two Class A office buildings of approximately 88,000 square feet in the aggregate, with panoramic unobstructed views of the Torrey Pines State Park Beach, Torrey Reserve and the Pacific Ocean. Projected costs of the development at Torrey Point remain approximately $56 million, of which approximately $34 million has been incurred to date. We expect to incur the remaining costs for development of Torrey Point in 2017. We expect the Torrey Point development to be stabilized in 2018 with an estimated stabilized cash yield of approximately 7% to 8%. Our development opportunities are subject to market conditions and actual results may vary. Private Placement of Notes On March 1, 2017, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement for the private placement of $250 million of 4.29% Senior Guaranteed Notes, Series D, due March 1, 2027 (the ""Series D Notes""). The Series D Notes were issued on March 1, 2017 and will pay interest quarterly on the last day of January, April, July and October until their respective maturities.  Net of the settlement of the forward-starting interest rate swap, the fixed economic interest rate for the Series D Notes is approximately 3.87% per annum, through maturity. Balance Sheet and Liquidity At March 31, 2017, the company had gross real estate assets of $2.3 billion and liquidity of $440.1 million, comprised of cash and cash equivalents of $190.1 million and $250.0 million of availability on its line of credit.    For the quarter ended March 31, 2017, we issued 700,000 shares of common stock through our at-the-market equity (""ATM"") program at a weighted average price per share of $43.46, resulting in net proceeds of $30.1 million.  We intend to use the net proceeds primarily to pay for acquisitions, fund development activities at Torrey Point and to repay existing indebtedness. As of March 31, 2017, we had the capacity to issue up to an additional $176.2 million in shares of common stock under our ATM program. Dividends The company declared dividends on its shares of common stock of $0.26 per share for the first quarter of 2017.  The dividends were paid on March 30, 2017.

The dividend will be paid on June 29, 2017 to stockholders of record on June 15, 2017. Subsequent Event On April 28, 2017, we acquired the Pacific Ridge Apartments, a 533 unit, luxury apartment community, built in 2013 and located in San Diego, California. The purchase price was approximately $232 million, excluding closing costs and prorations. The property was acquired with cash on hand and borrowings under our Amended and Restated Credit Agreement. Guidance The company increased its guidance for full year 2017 FFO per diluted share range from the prior range of $1.98 to $2.06 per share to $2.00 to $2.06 per share, which represents an increase of approximately 1% from the prior midpoint. The company's guidance excludes any impact from future acquisitions, dispositions, equity issuances or repurchases, future debt financings or repayments. The company will discuss key assumptions regarding the guidance on tomorrow's conference call, as described below. The foregoing estimates are forward-looking and reflect management's view of current and future market conditions, including certain assumptions with respect to leasing activity, rental rates, occupancy levels, interest rates, credit spreads and the amount and timing of acquisition and development activities.

Use of Non-GAAP Information The company calculates FFO in accordance with the standards established by the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, or NAREIT. FFO represents net income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains (or losses) from sales of depreciable operating property, impairment losses, real estate related depreciation and amortization (excluding amortization of deferred financing costs) and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. FFO is a supplemental non-GAAP financial measure. Management uses FFO as a supplemental performance measure because it believes that FFO is beneficial to investors as a starting point in measuring the company's operational performance. Specifically, in excluding real estate related depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions, which do not relate to or are not indicative of operating performance, FFO provides a performance measure that, when compared year-over-year, captures trends in occupancy rates, rental rates and operating costs. The company also believes that, as a widely recognized measure of the performance of REITs, FFO will be used by investors as a basis to compare the company's operating performance with that of other REITs. However, because FFO excludes depreciation and amortization and captures neither the changes in the value of the company's properties that result from use or market conditions nor the level of capital expenditures and leasing commissions necessary to maintain the operating performance of the company's properties, all of which have real economic effects and could materially impact the company's results from operations, the utility of FFO as a measure of the company's performance is limited. In addition, other equity REITs may not calculate FFO in accordance with the NAREIT definition as the company does, and, accordingly, the company's FFO may not be comparable to such other REITs' FFO.  Accordingly, FFO should be considered only as a supplement to net income as a measure of the company's performance. FFO should not be used as a measure of the company's liquidity, nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company's cash needs, including the company's ability to pay dividends or service indebtedness. FFO also should not be used as a supplement to or substitute for cash flow from operating activities computed in accordance with GAAP. About American Assets Trust, Inc. American Assets Trust, Inc.
