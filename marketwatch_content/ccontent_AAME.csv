AAME,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Atlantic American Corporation (""Atlantic American"" or the ""Parent"") and its subsidiaries (collectively with the Parent, the ""Company"") for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein. Atlantic American is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted primarily through its insurance subsidiaries: American Southern Insurance Company and American Safety Insurance Company (together known as ""American Southern"") in the property and casualty insurance industry, and Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company and Bankers Fidelity Assurance Company (together known as ""Bankers Fidelity"") in the life and health insurance industry. Each operating company is managed separately, offers different products and is evaluated on its individual performance. Critical Accounting Policies The accounting and reporting policies of the Company are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") and, in management's belief, conform to general practices within the insurance industry. The following is an explanation of the Company's accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management. These accounting policies inherently require significant judgment and assumptions and actual operating results could differ significantly from management's estimates determined using these policies. Atlantic American does not expect that changes in the estimates determined using these policies will have a material effect on the Company's financial condition or liquidity, although changes could have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations. Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses comprised 29% of the Company's total liabilities at December 31, 2017. This liability includes estimates for: 1) unpaid losses on claims reported prior to December 31, 2017, 2) future development on those reported claims, 3) unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to December 31, 2017 but not yet reported and 4) unpaid loss adjustment expenses for reported and unreported claims incurred prior to December 31, 2017. Quantification of loss estimates for each of these components involves a significant degree of judgment and estimates may vary, materially, from period to period. Estimated unpaid losses on reported claims are developed based on historical experience with similar claims by the Company. Development on reported claims, estimates of unpaid ultimate losses on claims incurred prior to December 31, 2017 but not yet reported, and estimates of unpaid loss adjustment expenses are developed based on the Company's historical experience, using actuarial methods to assist in the analysis. The Company's actuaries develop ranges of estimated development on reported and unreported claims as well as loss adjustment expenses using various methods, including the paid-loss development method, the reported-loss development method, the paid Bornhuetter-Ferguson method and the reported Bornhuetter-Ferguson method. Any single method used to estimate ultimate losses has inherent advantages and disadvantages due to the trends and changes affecting the business environment and the Company's administrative policies. Further, external factors, such as legislative changes, medical cost inflation, and others may directly or indirectly impact the relative adequacy of liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses. The Company's approach is to select an estimate of ultimate losses based on comparing results of a variety of reserving methods, as opposed to total reliance on any single method. Unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses are reviewed periodically for significant lines of business, and when current results differ from the original assumptions used to develop such estimates, the amount of the Company's recorded liability for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses is adjusted. In the event the Company's actual reported losses in any period are materially in excess of the previously estimated amounts, such losses, to the extent reinsurance coverage does not exist, could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. TABLE OF CONTENTS Future policy benefits comprised 36% of the Company's total liabilities at December 31, 2017. These liabilities relate primarily to life insurance products and are based upon assumed future investment yields, mortality rates, and withdrawal rates after giving effect to possible risks of adverse deviation. The assumed mortality and withdrawal rates are based upon the Company's experience. If actual results differ from the initial assumptions, the amount of the Company's recorded liability could require adjustment. Deferred acquisition costs comprised 10% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2017. Deferred acquisition costs are commissions, premium taxes, and other incremental direct costs of contract acquisition that results directly from and are essential to the contract transaction(s) and would not have been incurred by the Company had the contract transaction(s) not occurred. The deferred amounts are recorded as an asset on the balance sheet and amortized to expense in a systematic manner. Traditional life insurance and long-duration health insurance deferred policy acquisition costs are amortized over the estimated premium-paying period of the related policies using assumptions consistent with those used in computing the related liability for policy benefit reserves. Deferred acquisition costs for property and casualty insurance and short-duration health insurance are amortized over the effective period of the related insurance policies. Deferred policy acquisition costs are expensed when such costs are deemed not to be recoverable from future premiums (for traditional life and long-duration health insurance) and from the related unearned premiums and investment income (for property and casualty and short-duration health insurance). Assessments of recoverability for property and casualty and short-duration health insurance are extremely sensitive to the estimates of a subsequent year's projected losses related to the unearned premiums. Projected loss estimates for a current block of business for which unearned premiums remain to be earned may vary significantly from the indicated losses incurred in any previous calendar year. Receivables are amounts due from reinsurers, insureds and agents, and any sales of investment securities not yet settled, and comprised 9% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2017. Insured and agent balances are evaluated periodically for collectibility. Annually, the Company performs an analysis of the creditworthiness of the reinsurers with whom the Company contracts using various data sources. Failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations due to insolvencies, disputes or otherwise could result in uncollectible amounts and losses to the Company. Allowances for uncollectible amounts are established, as and when a loss has been determined probable, against the related receivable. Losses are recognized by the Company when determined on a specific account basis and a general provision for loss is made based on the Company's historical experience. Cash and investments comprised 79% of the Company's total assets at December 31, 2017. Substantially all of the Company's investments are in bonds and common and preferred stocks, the values of which are subject to significant market fluctuations. The Company carries all fixed maturities, which includes bonds and redeemable preferred stocks, and equity securities, which includes common and non-redeemable preferred stocks, as available for sale and, accordingly, at their estimated fair values. The Company owns certain fixed maturities that do not have publicly quoted values, but had an estimated fair value as determined by management of $1.4 million at December 31, 2017. Such values inherently involve a greater degree of judgment and uncertainty and therefore ultimately greater price volatility than the value of securities with publicly quoted market values. On occasion, the value of an investment may decline to a value below its amortized purchase price and remain at such value for an extended period of time. When an investment's indicated fair value has declined below its cost basis for a period of time, the Company evaluates such investment for an other than temporary impairment. The evaluation for an other than temporary impairment is a quantitative and qualitative process, which is subject to risks and uncertainties in the determination of whether declines in the fair value of investments are other than temporary. Potential risks and uncertainties include, among other things, changes in general economic conditions, an issuer's financial condition or near term recovery prospects and the effects of changes in interest rates. In evaluating a potential impairment, the Company considers, among other factors, management's intent and ability to hold the securities until price recovery, the nature of the investment and the expectation of prospects for the issuer and its industry, the status of an issuer's continued satisfaction of its obligations in accordance with their contractual terms, and management's expectation as to the issuer's ability and intent to continue to do so, as well as ratings actions that may affect the issuer's credit status. If an other than temporary impairment is deemed to exist, then the Company will write down the amortized cost basis of the investment to its estimated fair value. While any such write down does not impact the reported value of the investment in the Company's balance sheet, it is reflected as a realized investment loss in the Company's consolidated statements of operations in the period incurred. TABLE OF CONTENTS The Company determines the fair values of certain financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in Accounting Standards Codification (""ASC"") 820-10-20, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (""ASC 820-10-20""). The fair values of fixed maturities and equity securities are largely determined by either independent methods prescribed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, which do not differ materially from nationally quoted market prices, when available, or independent broker quotations. See Note 2 and Note 14 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements with respect to assets and liabilities carried at fair value and information about the inputs used to value those financial instruments, by hierarchy level, in accordance with ASC 820-10-20. Deferred income taxes reflect the effect of temporary differences between assets and liabilities that are recognized for financial reporting purposes and the amounts that are recognized for tax purposes. These deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are recognized to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is deemed more likely than not to be realized. In assessing the likelihood of realization, management considers estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies. Refer to Note 1 of ""Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements"" for details regarding the Company's significant accounting policies.  Overall Corporate Results Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (In thousands) Revenue Property and Casualty: American Southern $ 59,485 $ 58,159 Life and Health: Bankers Fidelity 117,495 107,505 Corporate and Other 4,134 413 Total revenue $ 181,114 $ 166,077 Income before income taxes Property and Casualty: American Southern $ 8,567 $ 7,314 Life and Health: Bankers Fidelity (268 ) 2,950 Corporate and Other (2,943 ) (6,740 ) Income before income taxes $ 5,356 $ 3,524 Net income $ 4,528 $ 2,636  Management also considers and evaluates performance by analyzing the non-GAAP measure operating income, and believes it is a useful metric for investors, potential investors, securities analysts and others because it isolates the ""core"" operating results of the Company before considering certain items that are either beyond the control of management (such as taxes, which are subject to timing, regulatory and rate changes depending on the timing of the associated revenues and expenses) or are not expected to regularly impact the Company's operational results (such as any realized investment gains, which are not a part of the Company's primary operations and are, to a limited extent, subject to discretion in terms of timing of realization). TABLE OF CONTENTS A reconciliation of net income to operating income is as follows:  Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (In thousands) Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure Net income $ 4,528 $ 2,636 Income tax expense 828 888 Realized investment gains, net (9,168 ) (2,595 ) Operating income (loss) $ (3,812 ) $ 929  On a consolidated basis, the Company had net income of $4.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in 2017, compared to $2.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, in 2016. Operating loss was $3.8 million in 2017 as compared to operating income of $0.9 million in 2016. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to unfavorable loss experience in the life and health operations. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income was a decrease in investment income attributable to a decrease in the average yield on the Company's investments in fixed maturities and losses from the equity in earnings from investments in real estate partnerships. Total revenue was $181.1 million in 2017 as compared to $166.1 million in 2016. Premium revenue increased to $163.3 million in 2017 from $153.5 million in 2016. The increase in premium revenue was primarily due to an increase in Medicare supplement business in the life and health operations. Also included in total revenue were net realized investment gains of $9.2 million in 2017 compared to $2.6 million in 2016. The magnitude of realized investment gains and losses in any year is a function of the timing of trades of investments relative to the markets themselves as well as the recognition of any other than temporary impairments on investments. Total expenses were $175.8 million in 2017 as compared to $162.6 million in 2016. As a percentage of premiums, insurance benefits and losses incurred and commissions and underwriting expenses were 98.6% in 2017 and 96.4% in 2016. A more detailed analysis of the operating companies and other corporate activities follows. TABLE OF CONTENTS  UNDERWRITING RESULTS American Southern The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, American Southern's premiums, losses, expenses and underwriting ratios: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Gross written premiums $ 58,149 $ 56,131 Ceded premiums (4,787 ) (4,654 ) Net written premiums $ 53,362 $ 51,477 Net earned premiums $ 53,661 $ 53,763 Net losses and loss adjustment expenses 34,486 34,408 Underwriting expenses 16,432 16,437 Underwriting income $ 2,743 $ 2,918 Loss ratio 64.3 % 64.0 % Expense ratio 30.6 30.6 Combined ratio 94.9 % 94.6 %  Gross written premiums at American Southern increased $2.0 million, or 3.6%, during 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in gross written premiums was primarily attributable to an increase in automobile liability written premiums from existing programs. Also contributing to the increase in gross written premiums were increases in the automobile physical damage and surety lines of business from two new agencies. Ceded premiums increased $0.1 million, or 2.9%, during 2017 as compared to 2016. The increase in ceded premiums was primarily due to a reinsurance rate increase in the automobile liability line of business. The following table summarizes, for the periods indicated, American Southern's net earned premiums by line of business:  Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (In thousands) Automobile liability $ 29,370 $ 28,219 Automobile physical damage 9,972 10,192 General liability 2,953 3,009 Surety 8,441 8,999 Other lines 2,925 3,344 Total $ 53,661 $ 53,763  Net earned premiums decreased slightly during 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease in net earned premiums was primarily attributable to decreases in automobile physical damage and surety net earned premiums resulting from decreased business writings in 2016. Premiums are earned ratably over their respective policy terms, and therefore premiums earned in the current year are related to policies written during both the current year and immediately preceding year. The performance of an insurance company is often measured by its combined ratio. The combined ratio represents the percentage of losses, loss adjustment expenses and other expenses that are incurred for each dollar of premium earned by the company. A combined ratio of under 100% represents an underwriting profit while a combined ratio of over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. The combined ratio is divided into two components, the loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned) and the expense ratio (the ratio of expenses incurred to premiums earned). TABLE OF CONTENTS Net losses and loss adjustment expenses at American Southern increased slightly during 2017 as compared to 2016. As a percentage of premiums, net losses and loss adjustment expenses were 64.3% in 2017 compared to 64.0% in 2016. The slight increase in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to less favorable loss experience in the general liability and surety lines of business during 2017 as compared to 2016. Underwriting expenses decreased slightly during 2017 as compared to 2016. As a percentage of premiums, underwriting expenses were 30.6% in 2017 and 2016. The nominal increase in the expense ratio was primarily due to American Southern's use of a variable commission structure with certain agents, which compensates the participating agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write. In 2017, variable commissions at American Southern increased $0.2 million as compared to 2016 due to more favorable loss experience from certain accounts subject to variable commissions. In establishing reserves, American Southern initially reserves for losses at the higher end of the reasonable range if no other value within the range is determined to be more probable. Selection of such an initial loss estimate is an attempt by management to give recognition that initial claims information received generally is not conclusive with respect to legal liability, is generally not comprehensive with respect to magnitude of loss and generally, based on historical experience, will develop more adversely as time passes and more information becomes available. However, as a result, American Southern generally experiences reserve redundancies when analyzing the development of prior year losses in a current period. At December 31, 2017, the range of estimates developed in connection with the loss reserves for American Southern indicated that reserves could be as much as 9.7% lower or as much as 12.1% higher. Development from prior years' reserves has historically reduced the current year loss ratio; however, such reduction in the current year loss ratio is generally offset by the reserves established in the current year for current period losses. American Southern's estimated net reserve redundancies for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 were $2.5 million and $2.1 million, respectively. To the extent reserve redundancies vary between years, there is an incremental impact on the results of operations of American Southern and the Company. The indicated redundancy in 2017 was $0.4 million more than in 2016. After considering the impact on contingent commissions and other related accruals, the $0.4 million increase in the redundancy resulted in an estimated increase in income from operations before tax of approximately $0.2 million in 2017 as compared to 2016. Management believes that such differences will continue in future periods but is unable to determine if or when incremental redundancies will increase or decrease, until the underlying losses are ultimately settled. Contingent commissions, if contractually applicable, are ultimately payable to participating agents based on the underlying profitability of a particular insurance contract or a group of insurance contracts, and are periodically evaluated and accrued as earned. In 2017, approximately 51% of American Southern's earned premium provides for contractual commission arrangements which compensate the company's agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write, compared to 52% in 2016. By structuring its business in this manner, American Southern provides its agents with an economic incentive to place profitable business with American Southern. In periods in which loss reserves reflect favorable development from prior years' reserves, there is generally a highly correlated increase in commission expense also related to the prior year business. Accordingly, favorable loss development from prior years, while anticipated to continue in future periods, is not an indicator of significant additional profitability in the current year. TABLE OF CONTENTS Bankers Fidelity The following summarizes, for the periods indicated, Bankers Fidelity's premiums, losses and expenses: Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Medicare supplement $ 93,652 $ 84,107 Other health products 6,440 5,621 Life insurance 9,574 9,974 Total earned premiums 109,666 99,702 Insurance benefits and losses 83,029 68,789 Underwriting expenses 34,734 35,766 Total expenses 117,763 104,555 Underwriting loss $ (8,097 ) $ (4,853 ) Loss ratio 75.7 % 69.0 % Expense ratio 31.7 35.9 Combined ratio 107.4 % 104.9 %  Premium revenue at Bankers Fidelity increased $10.0 million, or 10.0%, during 2017 as compared to 2016. Premiums from the Medicare supplement line of business increased $9.5 million, or 11.3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016, due primarily to the successful execution of new business generating strategies with both new and existing agents. Other health product premiums increased $0.8 million, or 14.6%, during 2017 as compared to 2016, primarily as a result of new sales of the company's disability income and group health products. Premiums from the life insurance line of business decreased $0.4 million, or 4.0%, in 2017 from 2016 due to the redemption and settlement of existing policy obligations exceeding the level of new sales activity. Medicare supplement premiums ceded under the reinsurance agreement in 2017 and 2016 were approximately $32.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Benefits and losses increased $14.2 million, or 20.7%, during 2017 as compared to 2016. As a percentage of premiums, benefits and losses were 75.7% in 2017 compared to 69.0% in 2016. The increase in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to unfavorable loss experience in the Medicare supplement line. Further, beginning late in 2016 and continuing throughout the first quarter of 2017, Bankers Fidelity experienced significantly increased levels of mortality and morbidity across all lines of business which had an unfavorable effect on the company's loss patterns and increased the resultant 2017 loss ratio. Underwriting expenses decreased $1.0 million, or 2.9%, during 2017 as compared to 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, these expenses were 31.7% in 2017 compared to 35.9% in 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to the increase in earned premiums coupled with a relatively consistent level of fixed general and administrative expenses. Also contributing to the decrease in the expense ratio was a reinsurance expense-reimbursement allowance associated with the Company's reinsurance agreement, which reimbursed the company for a portion of its indirect underwriting expenses. Investment Income and Realized Gains Investment income decreased $1.4 million, or 14.0%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease in investment income was primarily attributable to a decrease in the average yield on the Company's investments in fixed maturities and losses from the equity in earnings from investments in real estate partnerships. The Company had net realized investment gains of $9.2 million in 2017 compared to net realized investment gains of $2.6 million in 2016. The net realized investment gains in 2017 and 2016 were primarily attributable to gains of $6.0 million and $1.6 million, respectively, from the sale of property held within the Company's real estate partnership investments as well as gains from the sale of a number of the Company's investments in fixed maturities. Management continually evaluates the Company's investment portfolio and, as may be determined to be appropriate, makes adjustments for impairments and/or will divest investments. See Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. TABLE OF CONTENTS Interest Expense Interest expense increased $0.2 million, or 10.3%, in 2017 as compared to 2016 due to an increase during the year in the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), as the interest rates on the Company's outstanding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (""Junior Subordinated Debentures"") are directly related to LIBOR. Other Expenses Other expenses (commissions, underwriting expenses, and other expenses) decreased $1.3 million, or 2.2%, in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease in other expenses was primarily attributable to a reinsurance expense-reimbursement allowance associated with the reinsurance agreement in the life and health operations, which reimbursed a portion of the Company's indirect underwriting expenses. Partially offsetting the decrease in other expenses was the $0.2 million increase in variable commission accruals at American Southern due to favorable loss experience from certain accounts subject to variable commissions. American Southern's variable commission structure compensates the participating agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write. As a percentage of earned premiums, other expenses were 34.6% in 2017 as compared . . . Mar 26, 2018 (c) 1995-2018 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

AAME,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Atlantic American Corporation (""Atlantic American"" or the ""Parent"") and its subsidiaries (collectively with the Parent, the ""Company"") as of and for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein, as well as with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the ""Annual Report""). Atlantic American is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted primarily through its insurance subsidiaries: American Southern Insurance Company and American Safety Insurance Company (together known as ""American Southern"") and Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company and Bankers Fidelity Assurance Company (together known as ""Bankers Fidelity""). Each operating company is managed separately, offers different products and is evaluated on its individual performance. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The Company has identified certain estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability. The Company's critical accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management are disclosed in the Annual Report. During the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, there were no changes to the critical accounting policies or related estimates from those disclosed in the Annual Report. Overall Corporate Results The following presents the Company's revenue, expenses and net income for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Insurance premiums $ 42,094 $ 39,432 $ 122,996 $ 117,012 Investment income 2,136 2,453 6,380 7,523 Realized investment gains, net 539 527 2,818 1,411 Other income 29 35 95 102 Total revenue 44,798 42,447 132,289 126,048 Insurance benefits and losses incurred 30,417 26,955 87,446 78,702 Commissions and underwriting expenses 10,176 11,558 31,800 34,339 Other expense 3,134 3,221 9,301 9,803 Interest expense 440 396 1,273 1,154 Total benefits and expenses 44,167 42,130 129,820 123,998 Income before income taxes $ 631 $ 317 $ 2,469 $ 2,050 Net income $ 747 $ 149 $ 1,986 $ 1,288  -21- Table of Contents A reconciliation of net income to operating income (loss) for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016 is as follows:  Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net income $ 747 $ 149 $ 1,986 $ 1,288 Income tax expense (benefit) (116 ) 168 483 762 Realized investment gains, net (539 ) (527 ) (2,818 ) (1,411 ) Operating income (loss) $ 92 $ (210 ) $ (349 ) $ 639  On a consolidated basis, the Company had net income of $0.7 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, for the three month period ended September 30, 2017, compared to net income of $0.1 million, or nil per diluted share, for the three month period ended September 30, 2016. The Company had net income of $2.0 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, compared to net income of $1.3 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. Premium revenue for the three month period ended September 30, 2017 increased $2.7 million, or 6.8%, to $42.1 million from $39.4 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2016. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, premium revenue increased $6.0 million, or 5.1%, to $123.0 million from $117.0 million in the comparable 2016 period. The increase in premium revenue for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in Medicare supplement business in the life and health operations. The increase in net income for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was due primarily to the increase in premium revenue, as well as an increase in realized investment gains. Operating income increased $0.3 million in the three month period ended September 30, 2017 over the three month period ended September 30, 2016, and decreased $1.0 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. The increase in operating income for the three month period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to increased profitability in the property and casualty operations. Partially offsetting the increase in operating income for the three month period ended September 30, 2017 was a decrease in investment income attributable to a decrease in the average yield on the Company's investments in fixed maturities and a loss from the equity in earnings from investments in real estate partnerships. The decrease in operating income for the nine month period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to unfavorable loss experience in the life and health operations and the decrease in investment income discussed previously. A more detailed analysis of the individual operating companies and other corporate activities follows. -22- Table of Contents American Southern The following summarizes American Southern's premiums, losses, expenses and underwriting ratios for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Gross written premiums $ 9,520 $ 8,704 $ 46,505 $ 43,766 Ceded premiums (1,238 ) (1,184 ) (3,592 ) (3,519 ) Net written premiums $ 8,282 $ 7,520 $ 42,913 $ 40,247 Net earned premiums $ 14,046 $ 12,884 $ 40,268 $ 40,376 Net loss and loss adjustment expenses 9,663 8,507 25,879 25,238 Underwriting expenses 3,525 3,751 11,583 12,535 Underwriting income $ 858 $ 626 $ 2,806 $ 2,603 Loss ratio 68.8 % 66.0 % 64.3 % 62.5 % Expense ratio 25.1 29.1 28.7 31.1 Combined ratio 93.9 % 95.1 % 93.0 % 93.6 %  Gross written premiums at American Southern increased $0.8 million, or 9.4%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $2.7 million, or 6.3%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, over the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in gross written premiums for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in automobile liability written premiums from existing programs. Also contributing to the increase in gross written premiums for the nine month period ended September 30, 2017 were increases in automobile physical damage and surety business from two new agencies. Ceded premiums increased slightly during the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 over the comparable periods in 2016 due primarily to a reinsurance rate increase in the automobile liability line of business. The following presents American Southern's net earned premiums by line of business for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016:  Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Automobile liability $ 7,971 $ 6,646 $ 22,103 $ 20,804 Automobile physical damage 2,424 2,511 7,297 7,675 General liability 745 747 2,211 2,274 Surety 2,091 2,212 6,418 7,002 Other lines 815 768 2,239 2,621 Total $ 14,046 $ 12,884 $ 40,268 $ 40,376  Net earned premiums increased $1.2 million, or 9.0%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017 over the three month period ended September 30, 2016, and decreased $0.1 million, or 0.3%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. The increase in net earned premiums for the three month period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in automobile liability earned premiums due to retrospective premium adjustments for certain accounts. The decrease in net earned premiums for the nine month period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to decreased writings in 2016 for automobile physical damage, surety and property lines of business. Premiums are earned ratably over their respective policy terms, and therefore premiums earned in the current year are related to policies written during both the current year and immediately preceding year. -23- Table of Contents Net loss and loss adjustment expenses at American Southern increased $1.2 million, or 13.6%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $0.6 million, or 2.5%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, over the comparable periods in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, net loss and loss adjustment expenses were 68.8% in the three month period ended September 30, 2017, compared to 66.0% in the three month period ended September 30, 2016. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, this ratio increased to 64.3% from 62.5% in the comparable period of 2016. The increase in the loss ratio for the three month period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to an increase in automobile liability claims from one of the company's governmental programs. The increase in the loss ratio for the nine month period ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to less favorable loss experience in the general liability and surety lines of business, as well as a $0.5 million loss recovery in the 2016 year to date period that did not recur in the comparable period of 2017. Underwriting expenses decreased $0.2 million, or 6.0%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017 and $1.0 million, or 7.6%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, from the comparable periods in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, underwriting expenses were 25.1% in the three month period ended September 30, 2017, compared to 29.1% in the three month period ended September 30, 2016. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, this ratio decreased to 28.7% from 31.1% in the comparable period of 2016. The change in the expense ratio for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to American Southern's use of a variable commission structure with certain agents, which compensates the participating agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write. As a result of this structure, during periods in which the loss ratio increases, commissions and underwriting expenses will generally decrease, and conversely, during periods in which the loss ratio decreases, commissions and underwriting expenses will generally increase. During the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017, variable commissions at American Southern decreased $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, from the comparable periods of 2016 due to less favorable loss experience from accounts subject to variable commissions. -24- Table of Contents Bankers Fidelity The following summarizes Bankers Fidelity's earned premiums, losses, expenses and underwriting ratios for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016: Three Months Ended Nine Months Ended September 30, September 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Medicare supplement $ 24,002 $ 22,571 $ 70,647 $ 64,801 Other health products 1,641 1,405 4,749 4,189 Life insurance 2,405 2,572 7,332 7,646 Total earned premiums 28,048 26,548 82,728 76,636 Insurance benefits and losses 20,754 18,448 61,567 53,464 Underwriting expenses 8,505 9,612 26,000 27,371 Total expenses 29,259 28,060 87,567 80,835 Underwriting loss $ (1,211 ) $ (1,512 ) $ (4,839 ) $ (4,199 ) Loss ratio 74.0 % 69.5 % 74.4 % 69.8 % Expense ratio 30.3 36.2 31.4 35.7 Combined ratio 104.3 % 105.7 % 105.8 % 105.5 %  Premium revenue at Bankers Fidelity increased $1.5 million, or 5.7%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $6.1 million, or 7.9%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, over the comparable periods in 2016. Premiums from the Medicare supplement line of business increased $1.4 million, or 6.3%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $5.8 million, or 9.0%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, due primarily to the successful execution of new business generating strategies with both new and existing agents. Other health product premiums increased $0.2 million and $0.6 million, respectively, during the same comparable periods, primarily as a result of new sales of the company's disability income and group health products. Premiums from the life insurance line of business decreased $0.2 million, or 6.5%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $0.3 million, or 4.1%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017 from the comparable 2016 periods due to the redemption and settlement of existing policy obligations exceeding the level of new sales activity. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Bankers Fidelity entered into a reinsurance agreement to moderate statutory capital requirements related to premium growth in the Medicare supplement line of business. Medicare supplement premiums ceded under the reinsurance agreement in the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 were approximately $8.6 million and $19.7 million, respectively. Benefits and losses increased $2.3 million, or 12.5%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $8.1 million, or 15.2%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, over the comparable periods in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, benefits and losses were 74.0% in the three month period ended September 30, 2017, compared to 69.5% in the three month period ended September 30, 2016. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, this ratio increased to 74.4% from 69.8% in the comparable period of 2016. The increase in the loss ratio for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to unfavorable loss experience in the Medicare supplement line. Further, beginning late in 2016 and continuing throughout the first quarter of 2017, Bankers Fidelity experienced significantly increased levels of mortality and morbidity across all lines of business which had an unfavorable effect on the company's loss patterns and increased the resultant 2017 year to date loss ratio. Underwriting expenses decreased $1.1 million, or 11.5%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $1.4 million, or 5.0%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, from the comparable periods in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, underwriting expenses were 30.3% in the three month period ended September 30, 2017, compared to 36.2% in the three month period ended September 30, 2016. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, this ratio decreased to 31.4% from 35.7% in the comparable period of 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was primarily due to the increase in earned premiums coupled with a relatively consistent level of fixed general and administrative expenses. Also contributing to the decrease in the expense ratio was a reinsurance expense-reimbursement allowance associated with the reinsurance agreement described above, which reimbursed the company for a portion of its indirect underwriting expenses. -25- Table of Contents INVESTMENT INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS Investment income decreased $0.3 million, or 12.9%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $1.1 million, or 15.2%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, from the comparable periods in 2016. The decrease in investment income for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was attributable to a decrease in the average yield on the Company's investments in fixed maturities and losses for the 2017 quarter and year to date period of $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, from the equity in earnings from investments in real estate partnerships. The Company had net realized investment gains of $0.5 million during each of the three month periods ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016. The Company had net realized investment gains of $2.8 million during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, compared to net realized investment gains of $1.4 million in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. The net realized investment gains in the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 were primarily attributable to gains from the sale of an equity security and a number of the Company's investments in fixed maturities. The net realized investment gains in the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 resulted primarily from the disposition of several of the Company's investments in fixed maturities. Net realized investment gains in the nine month period ended September 30, 2016 also included a $0.6 million gain from the sale of property held within one of the Company's real estate partnership investments. Management continually evaluates the Company's investment portfolio and, as may be determined to be appropriate, makes adjustments for impairments and/or will divest investments. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased slightly during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $0.1 million, or 10.3%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, over the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in interest expense for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was due to an increase in the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), as the interest rates on the Company's outstanding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (""Junior Subordinated Debentures"") are directly related to LIBOR. OTHER EXPENSES Other expenses (commissions, underwriting expenses, and other expenses) decreased $1.5 million, or 9.9%, during the three month period ended September 30, 2017, and $3.0 million, or 6.9%, during the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, from the comparable periods in 2016. The decrease in other expenses for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to a reinsurance expense-reimbursement allowance associated with the reinsurance agreement in the life and health operations, which reimbursed a portion of the Company's indirect underwriting expenses. Also contributing to the decrease for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 were decreases of $0.2 million and $0.5 million, respectively, in the variable commission accrual in the property and casualty operations. On a consolidated basis, as a percentage of earned premiums, other expenses decreased to 31.6% in the three month period ended September 30, 2017 from 37.5% in the three month period ended September 30, 2016. For the nine month period ended September 30, 2017, this ratio decreased to 33.4% from 37.7% in the comparable period of 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to the increase in earned premiums coupled with a lower level of general and administrative expenses. INCOME TAXES The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory income tax rate for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 resulted from the dividends-received deduction (""DRD"") and the small life insurance company deduction (""SLD""). The current estimated DRD is adjusted as underlying factors change and can vary from estimates based on, but not limited to, actual distributions from investments as well as the amount of the Company's taxable income. The SLD varies in amount and is determined at a rate of 60 percent of the tentative life insurance company taxable income (""LICTI""). The SLD for any taxable year is reduced (but not below zero) by 15 percent of the tentative LICTI for such taxable year as it exceeds $3.0 million and is ultimately phased out at $15.0 million. The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory income tax rate for the three month and nine month periods ended September 30, 2016 resulted from the provision-to-filed return adjustments, described below, and the DRD. -26- Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary cash needs of the Company are for the payment of claims and operating expenses, maintaining adequate statutory capital and surplus levels, and meeting debt service requirements. Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but generally are expected to continue within historical ranges. The Company's primary sources of cash are written premiums, investment income and proceeds from the sale and maturity of its invested assets. The Company believes that, within each operating company, total invested assets will be sufficient to satisfy all policy liabilities and that cash inflows from investment earnings, future premium receipts and reinsurance collections will be adequate to fund the payment of claims and expenses as needed. Cash flows at the Parent are derived from dividends, management fees, and tax-sharing payments, as described below, from the subsidiaries. The principal cash needs of the Parent are for the payment of operating expenses, the acquisition of capital assets and debt service requirements, as well as the repurchase of shares and payments of any dividends as may be authorized and approved by the Company's board of directors from time to time. At September 30, 2017, the Parent had approximately $22.0 million of unrestricted cash and investments. The Parent's insurance subsidiaries reported statutory net income of $2.0 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2017 compared to statutory net income of $4.6 million for the nine month period ended September 30, 2016. Statutory results are impacted by the recognition of all costs of acquiring business. In periods in which the Company's first year premiums increase, statutory results are generally lower than results determined under GAAP. . . . Nov 14, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

AAME,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following is management's discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of Atlantic American Corporation (""Atlantic American"" or the ""Parent"") and its subsidiaries (collectively with the Parent, the ""Company"") as of and for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017. This discussion should be read in conjunction with the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein, as well as with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Atlantic American is an insurance holding company whose operations are conducted primarily through its insurance subsidiaries: American Southern Insurance Company and American Safety Insurance Company (together known as ""American Southern"") and Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company and Bankers Fidelity Assurance Company (together known as ""Bankers Fidelity""). Each operating company is managed separately, offers different products and is evaluated on its individual performance. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. Actual results could differ significantly from those estimates. The Company has identified certain estimates that involve a higher degree of judgment and are subject to a significant degree of variability. The Company's critical accounting policies and the resultant estimates considered most significant by management are disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. During the six month period ended June 30, 2017, there were no changes to the critical accounting policies or related estimates from those disclosed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. Overall Corporate Results The following presents the Company's revenue, expenses and net income for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Insurance premiums $ 40,120 $ 39,122 $ 80,902 $ 77,580 Investment income 2,085 2,563 4,244 5,070 Realized investment gains, net 1,396 132 2,279 884 Other income 31 37 66 67 Total revenue 43,632 41,854 87,491 83,601 Insurance benefits and losses incurred 27,032 26,922 57,029 51,747 Commissions and underwriting expenses 11,010 10,954 21,624 22,781 Other expense 2,981 3,236 6,167 6,582 Interest expense 424 385 833 758 Total benefits and expenses 41,447 41,497 85,653 81,868 Income before income taxes $ 2,185 $ 357 $ 1,838 $ 1,733 Net income $ 1,460 $ 241 $ 1,239 $ 1,139  -20- Table of Contents A reconciliation of net income to operating income (loss) for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016 is as follows:  Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net income $ 1,460 $ 241 $ 1,239 $ 1,139 Income tax expense 725 116 599 594 Realized investment gains, net (1,396 ) (132 ) (2,279 ) (884 ) Operating income (loss) $ 789 $ 225 $ (441 ) $ 849  On a consolidated basis, the Company had net income of $1.5 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the three month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $0.2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, for the three month period ended June 30, 2016. The Company had net income of $1.2 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the six month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $1.1 million, or $0.05 per diluted share, for the six month period ended June 30, 2016. Premium revenue for the three month period ended June 30, 2017 increased $1.0 million, or 2.6%, to $40.1 million from $39.1 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2016. For the six month period ended June 30, 2017, premium revenue increased $3.3 million, or 4.3%, to $80.9 million from $77.6 million in the comparable 2016 period. The increase in premium revenue for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in Medicare supplement business in the life and health operations. The increase in net income for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was due primarily to an increase in realized investment gains. Operating income increased $0.6 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and decreased $1.3 million during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, from the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in operating income for the three month period ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to more favorable loss experience in both the property and casualty and life and health operations. Partially offsetting the increase in operating income for the three month period ended June 30, 2017 was a decrease in investment income attributable to a decrease in the average yield on the Company's investments in fixed maturities and a loss from the equity in earnings from investments in real estate partnerships. The decrease in operating income for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to adverse loss experience in the life and health operations during the first quarter of 2017. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 was the decrease in investment income discussed previously. A more detailed analysis of the individual operating companies and other corporate activities follows. -21- Table of Contents American Southern The following summarizes American Southern's premiums, losses, expenses and underwriting ratios for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Gross written premiums $ 29,688 $ 28,525 $ 36,985 $ 35,062 Ceded premiums (1,205 ) (1,158 ) (2,354 ) (2,335 ) Net written premiums $ 28,483 $ 27,367 $ 34,631 $ 32,727 Net earned premiums $ 13,131 $ 13,767 $ 26,222 $ 27,492 Net loss and loss adjustment expenses 7,932 8,817 16,216 16,731 Underwriting expenses 4,191 4,118 8,058 8,784 Underwriting income $ 1,008 $ 832 $ 1,948 $ 1,977 Loss ratio 60.4 % 64.0 % 61.8 % 60.9 % Expense ratio 31.9 29.9 30.7 31.9 Combined ratio 92.3 % 93.9 % 92.5 % 92.8 %  Gross written premiums at American Southern increased $1.2 million, or 4.1%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $1.9 million, or 5.5%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, over the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in gross written premiums for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to an increase in automobile liability written premiums from existing programs as well as increases in automobile physical damage and surety business from two new agencies. Also contributing to the increase in gross written premiums for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 was a returned premium of $0.5 million in the automobile liability line of business during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 that did not recur in the comparable period of 2017. Ceded premiums increased slightly during the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 over the comparable periods in 2016 due primarily to a reinsurance rate increase in the automobile liability line of business. The following presents American Southern's net earned premiums by line of business for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016 (in thousands):  Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (In thousands) Automobile liability $ 6,804 $ 7,356 $ 14,132 $ 14,158 Automobile physical damage 2,629 2,493 4,873 5,164 General liability 736 757 1,466 1,527 Surety 2,241 2,302 4,327 4,790 Other lines 721 859 1,424 1,853 Total $ 13,131 $ 13,767 $ 26,222 $ 27,492  Net earned premiums decreased $0.6 million, or 4.6%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $1.3 million, or 4.6%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, from the comparable periods in 2016. The decrease in net earned premiums for the three month period ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to a decrease in automobile liability earned premiums due to retrospective premium adjustments for certain accounts. The decrease in net earned premiums for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to decreased writings in 2016 for automobile physical damage, surety and property lines of business. Premiums are earned ratably over their respective policy terms, and therefore premiums earned in the current year are related to policies written during both the current year and immediately preceding year. -22- Table of Contents Net loss and loss adjustment expenses at American Southern decreased $0.9 million, or 10.0%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $0.5 million, or 3.1%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, from the comparable periods in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, net loss and loss adjustment expenses were 60.4% in the three month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to 64.0% in the three month period ended June 30, 2016. For the six month period ended June 30, 2017, this ratio increased to 61.8% from 60.9% in the comparable period of 2016. The decrease in the loss ratio for the three month period ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to more favorable loss experience in the automobile liability line of business. The slight increase in the 2017 year to date loss ratio was primarily due to a $0.5 million loss recovery in the surety line of business during the six month period ended June 30, 2016 that did not recur in the comparable period of 2017. Underwriting expenses increased $0.1 million, or 1.8%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017 over the three month period ended June 30, 2016, and decreased $0.7 million, or 8.3%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, underwriting expenses were 31.9% in the three month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to 29.9% in the three month period ended June 30, 2016. For the six month period ended June 30, 2017, this ratio decreased to 30.7% from 31.9% in the comparable period of 2016. The change in the expense ratio for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to American Southern's use of a variable commission structure with certain agents, which compensates the participating agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write. During periods in which the loss ratio decreases, commissions and underwriting expenses will generally increase, and conversely, during periods in which the loss ratio increases, commissions and underwriting expenses will generally decrease. During the three month period ended June 30, 2017, variable commissions at American Southern increased $0.1 million over the three month period ended June 30, 2016 due to more favorable loss experience from accounts subject to variable commissions. During the six month period ended June 30, 2017, variable commissions at American Southern decreased $0.3 million from the comparable period of 2016 due to less favorable loss experience from accounts subject to variable commissions. -23- Table of Contents Bankers Fidelity The following summarizes Bankers Fidelity's earned premiums, losses, expenses and underwriting ratios for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 and the comparable periods in 2016: Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Medicare supplement $ 22,794 $ 21,326 $ 46,645 $ 42,230 Other health products 1,644 1,415 3,108 2,784 Life insurance 2,551 2,614 4,927 5,074 Total earned premiums 26,989 25,355 54,680 50,088 Insurance benefits and losses 19,100 18,105 40,813 35,016 Underwriting expenses 8,837 8,829 17,495 17,759 Total expenses 27,937 26,934 58,308 52,775 Underwriting loss $ (948 ) $ (1,579 ) $ (3,628 ) $ (2,687 ) Loss ratio 70.8 % 71.4 % 74.6 % 69.9 % Expense ratio 32.7 34.8 32.0 35.5 Combined ratio 103.5 % 106.2 % 106.6 % 105.4 %  Premium revenue at Bankers Fidelity increased $1.6 million, or 6.4%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $4.6 million, or 9.2%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, over the comparable periods in 2016. Premiums from the Medicare supplement line of business increased $1.5 million, or 6.9%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $4.4 million, or 10.5%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, due primarily to successful execution of new business generating strategies with both new and existing agents. Other health product premiums increased $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, during the same comparable periods, primarily as a result of new sales of the company's disability income and group health products. Premiums from the life insurance line of business decreased $0.1 million, or 2.4%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $0.1 million, or 2.9%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017 from the comparable 2016 periods due to the redemption and settlement of existing policy obligations exceeding the level of new sales activity. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Bankers Fidelity entered into a reinsurance agreement to moderate statutory capital requirements related to premium growth in the Medicare supplement line of business. Medicare supplement premiums ceded under the reinsurance agreement in the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 were approximately $7.2 million and $11.1 million, respectively. Benefits and losses increased $1.0 million, or 5.5%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $5.8 million, or 16.6%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, over the comparable periods in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, benefits and losses were 70.8% in the three month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to 71.4% in the three month period ended June 30, 2016. For the six month period ended June 30, 2017, this ratio increased to 74.6% from 69.9% in the comparable period of 2016. The slight decrease in the loss ratio for the three month period ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to more favorable loss experience in the Medicare supplement line of business. The increase in the loss ratio for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to adverse loss experience in the Medicare supplement line of business during the first quarter of 2017. Beginning late in 2016 and continuing throughout the first quarter of 2017, Bankers Fidelity experienced significantly increased levels of mortality and morbidity across all lines of business which had an unfavorable effect on the company's loss patterns and increased the resultant 2017 year to date loss ratio. Underwriting expenses increased slightly during the three month period ended June 30, 2017 over the three month period ended June 30, 2016, and decreased $0.3 million, or 1.5%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, from the comparable period in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, underwriting expenses were 32.7% in the three month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to 34.8% in the three month period ended June 30, 2016. For the six month period ended June 30, 2017, this ratio decreased to 32.0% from 35.5% in the comparable period of 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was primarily due to the increase in earned premiums coupled with a relatively consistent level of fixed general and administrative expenses. Also contributing to the decrease in the expense ratio was a reinsurance expense-reimbursement allowance associated with the reinsurance agreement described above, which reimbursed the company for a portion of its indirect underwriting expenses. -24- Table of Contents INVESTMENT INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS Investment income decreased $0.5 million, or 18.7%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $0.8 million, or 16.3%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, from the comparable periods in 2016. The decrease in investment income for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was attributable to a decrease in the average yield on the Company's investments in fixed maturities and a loss for the 2017 quarter and year to date period of $0.2 million and $0.3 million, respectively, from the equity in earnings from investments in real estate partnerships. The Company had net realized investment gains of $1.4 million during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to net realized investment gains of $0.1 million in the three month period ended June 30, 2016. The Company had net realized investment gains of $2.3 million during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, compared to net realized investment gains of $0.9 million in the six month period ended June 30, 2016. The net realized investment gains in the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 were primarily attributable to gains from the sale of an equity security and a number of the Company's investments in fixed maturities. The net realized investment gains in the three month period ended June 30, 2016 resulted from the disposition of several of the Company's investments in fixed maturities. The net realized investment gain in the six month period ended June 30, 2016 was primarily due to a $0.6 million gain from the sale of property held within one of the Company's real estate partnership investments. Management continually evaluates the Company's investment portfolio and, as may be determined to be appropriate, makes adjustments for impairments and/or will divest investments. INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased slightly during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $0.1 million, or 9.9%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, over the comparable periods in 2016. The increase in interest expense for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was due to an increase in the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), as the interest rates on the Company's outstanding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (""Junior Subordinated Debentures"") are directly related to LIBOR. OTHER EXPENSES Other expenses (commissions, underwriting expenses, and other expenses) decreased $0.2 million, or 1.4%, during the three month period ended June 30, 2017, and $1.6 million, or 5.4%, during the six month period ended June 30, 2017, from the comparable periods in 2016. The decrease in other expenses for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to a reinsurance expense-reimbursement allowance associated with the reinsurance agreement in the life and health operations, which reimbursed a portion of the Company's indirect underwriting expenses; a decrease in incentive compensation accruals of $0.1 million and $0.5 million, respectively, from the comparable 2016 periods due to the Company's recent operating performance; and a $0.2 million decrease in compensation expense from stock awards. Also contributing to the decrease in other expenses for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 was a $0.3 million decrease in the variable commission accrual in the property and casualty operations. On a consolidated basis, as a percentage of earned premiums, other expenses decreased to 34.9% in the three month period ended June 30, 2017 from 36.3% in the three month period ended June 30, 2016. For the six month period ended June 30, 2017, this ratio decreased to 34.4% from 37.8% in the comparable period of 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was primarily attributable to the increase in earned premiums coupled with a lower level of general and administrative expenses. INCOME TAXES The primary differences between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory income tax rate for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 resulted from the dividends-received deduction (""DRD"") and the small life insurance company deduction (""SLD""). The current estimated DRD is adjusted as underlying factors change and can vary from estimates based on, but not limited to, actual distributions from investments as well as the amount of the Company's taxable income. The SLD varies in amount and is determined at a rate of 60 percent of the tentative life insurance company taxable income (""LICTI""). The SLD for any taxable year is reduced (but not below zero) by 15 percent of the tentative LICTI for such taxable year as it exceeds $3.0 million and is ultimately phased out at $15.0 million. The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory income tax rate for the three month and six month periods ended June 30, 2016 resulted from the DRD. -25- Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary cash needs of the Company are for the payment of claims and operating expenses, maintaining adequate statutory capital and surplus levels, and meeting debt service requirements. Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but generally are expected to continue within historical ranges. The Company's primary sources of cash are written premiums, investment income and proceeds from the sale and maturity of its invested assets. The Company believes that, within each operating company, total invested assets will be sufficient to satisfy all policy liabilities and that cash inflows from investment earnings, future premium receipts and reinsurance collections will be adequate to fund the payment of claims and expenses as needed. Cash flows at the Parent are derived from dividends, management fees, and tax-sharing payments, as described below, from the subsidiaries. The principal cash needs of the Parent are for the payment of operating expenses, the acquisition of capital assets and debt service requirements, as well as the repurchase of shares and payments of any dividends as may be authorized and approved by the Company's board of directors from time to time. At June 30, 2017, the Parent had approximately $18.5 million of unrestricted cash and investments. The Parent's insurance subsidiaries reported statutory net income of $0.5 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2017 compared to statutory net income of $3.4 million for the six month period ended June 30, 2016. Statutory results are impacted by the recognition of all costs of acquiring business. In periods in which the Company's first year premiums increase, statutory results are generally lower than results determined under GAAP. Statutory results for . . .

Overall Corporate Results The following presents the Company's revenue, expenses and net income (loss) for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and the comparable period in 2016: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (In thousands) Insurance premiums $ 40,782 $ 38,458 Investment income 2,159 2,507 Realized investment gains, net 883 752 Other income 35 30 Total revenue 43,859 41,747 Insurance benefits and losses incurred 29,997 24,825 Commissions and underwriting expenses 10,614 11,827 Other expense 3,186 3,346 Interest expense 409 373 Total benefits and expenses 44,206 40,371 Income (loss) before income taxes $ (347 ) $ 1,376 Net income (loss) $ (221 ) $ 898  -19- Table of Contents A reconciliation of net income (loss) to operating income (loss) for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and the comparable period in 2016 is as follows:  Three Months Ended March 31, Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measure 2017 2016 (In thousands) Net income (loss) $ (221 ) $ 898 Income tax expense (benefit) (126 ) 478 Realized investment gains, net (883 ) (752 ) Operating income (loss) $ (1,230 ) $ 624  On a consolidated basis, the Company had a net loss of $0.2 million, or a loss of $0.02 per diluted share, for the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to net income of $0.9 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, for the three month period ended March 31, 2016. Premium revenue for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 increased $2.3 million, or 6.0%, to $40.8 million. The increase in premium revenue was primarily attributable to an increase in Medicare supplement business. Operating income decreased $1.9 million in the three month period ended March 31, 2017 from the comparable period of 2016. The decrease in operating income was primarily due to adverse loss experience in the life and health operations. Also contributing to the decrease in operating income for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was a decrease in investment income attributable not only to a decrease in the average yield on the Company's investments in fixed maturities but also a $0.2 million loss from the equity in earnings from investments in real estate partnerships. A more detailed analysis of the individual operating companies and other corporate activities follows. American Southern The following summarizes American Southern's premiums, losses, expenses and underwriting ratios for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and the comparable period in 2016: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Gross written premiums $ 7,297 $ 6,537 Ceded premiums (1,149 ) (1,177 ) Net written premiums $ 6,148 $ 5,360 Net earned premiums $ 13,091 $ 13,725 Net loss and loss adjustment expenses 8,284 7,914 Underwriting expenses 3,867 4,666 Underwriting income $ 940 $ 1,145 Loss ratio 63.3 % 57.7 % Expense ratio 29.5 34.0 Combined ratio 92.8 % 91.7 %  -20- Table of Contents Ceded premiums decreased slightly during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016 due primarily to a decrease in the related earned premiums. As American Southern's ceded premiums are determined as a percentage of earned premiums, ceded premiums generally increase or decrease when earned premiums increase or decrease. The following presents American Southern's net earned premiums by line of business for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and the comparable period in 2016:  Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (In thousands) Automobile liability $ 7,328 $ 6,802 Automobile physical damage 2,244 2,671 General liability 730 770 Surety 2,086 2,488 Other lines 703 994 Total $ 13,091 $ 13,725  Net earned premiums decreased $0.6 million, or 4.6%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in net earned premiums was primarily attributable to decreases in automobile physical damage and surety earned premiums resulting from decreased business writings in 2016. Premiums are earned ratably over their respective policy terms, and therefore premiums earned in the current year are related to policies written during both the current year and immediately preceding year. The performance of an insurance company is often measured by its combined ratio. The combined ratio represents the percentage of losses, loss adjustment expenses and other expenses that are incurred for each dollar of premium earned by the company. A combined ratio of under 100% represents an underwriting profit while a combined ratio of over 100% indicates an underwriting loss. The combined ratio is divided into two components, the loss ratio (the ratio of losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred to premiums earned) and the expense ratio (the ratio of expenses incurred to premiums earned). Net loss and loss adjustment expenses at American Southern increased $0.4 million, or 4.7%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 over the comparable period in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, net loss and loss adjustment expenses were 63.3% in the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to 57.7% in the three month period ended March 31, 2016. The increase in the loss ratio was primarily due to a $0.5 million loss recovery in the surety line of business and favorable loss experience in the general liability line of business during the three month period ended March 31, 2016 that did not recur in the comparable period of 2017. Partially offsetting the increase in the loss ratio during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was more favorable loss experience in the automobile liability and automobile physical damage lines of business. Underwriting expenses decreased $0.8 million, or 17.1%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, underwriting expenses were 29.5% in the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to 34.0% in the three month period ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to American Southern's use of a variable commission structure with certain agents, which compensates the participating agents in relation to the loss ratios of the business they write. During the three month period ended March 31, 2017, variable commissions at American Southern decreased $0.4 million from the comparable period in 2016 due to unfavorable loss experience from accounts subject to variable commissions. -21- Table of Contents Bankers Fidelity The following summarizes Bankers Fidelity's earned premiums, losses, expenses and underwriting ratios for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 and the comparable period in 2016: Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (Dollars in thousands) Medicare supplement $ 23,851 $ 20,904 Other health products 1,464 1,369 Life insurance 2,376 2,460 Total earned premiums 27,691 24,733 Insurance benefits and losses 21,713 16,911 Underwriting expenses 8,658 8,930 Total expenses 30,371 25,841 Underwriting loss $ (2,680 ) $ (1,108 ) Loss ratio 78.4 % 68.4 % Expense ratio 31.3 36.1 Combined ratio 109.7 % 104.5 %  Premium revenue at Bankers Fidelity increased $3.0 million, or 12.0%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 over the comparable period in 2016. Premiums from the Medicare supplement line of business increased $2.9 million, or 14.1%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017, due primarily to successful execution of new business generating strategies with both new and existing agents. Other health product premiums increased $0.1 million, or 6.9%, during the same comparable period, primarily as a result of new sales of the company's disability income products. Premiums from the life insurance line of business decreased $0.1 million, or 3.4%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 due to the redemption and settlement of existing policy obligations exceeding the level of new sales activity. During the fourth quarter of 2016, Bankers Fidelity entered into a reinsurance agreement to moderate statutory capital requirements related to premium growth in the Medicare supplement line of business. Medicare supplement premiums ceded under the reinsurance agreement were approximately $3.9 million in the three month period ended March 31, 2017. Benefits and losses increased $4.8 million, or 28.4%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 over the comparable period in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, benefits and losses were 78.4% in the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to 68.4% in the three month period ended March 31, 2016. The increase in the loss ratio was primarily attributable to adverse loss experience in the Medicare supplement line of business. Beginning late in 2016 and continuing throughout the three month period ended March 31, 2017, Bankers Fidelity experienced significantly increased levels of mortality and morbidity across all lines of business which had an unfavorable effect on the company's loss patterns and increased the resultant quarterly loss ratio. Underwriting expenses decreased $0.3 million, or 3.0%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016. As a percentage of earned premiums, underwriting expenses were 31.3% in the three month period ended March 31, 2017, compared to 36.1% in the three month period ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily due to the increase in earned premiums coupled with a relatively consistent level of fixed general and administrative expenses. Also contributing to the decrease in the expense ratio was a reinsurance expense-reimbursement allowance associated with the reinsurance agreement described above, which reimbursed the company for a portion of its indirect underwriting expenses. INVESTMENT INCOME AND REALIZED GAINS Investment income decreased $0.3 million, or 13.9%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in investment income was attributable not only to a decrease in the average yield on the Company's investments in fixed maturities but also a $0.2 million loss from the equity in earnings from investments in real estate partnerships. -22- Table of Contents INTEREST EXPENSE Interest expense increased slightly during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 over the comparable period in 2016. The increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR""), as the interest rates on the Company's outstanding junior subordinated deferrable interest debentures (""Junior Subordinated Debentures"") are directly related to LIBOR. OTHER EXPENSES Other expenses (commissions, underwriting expenses, and other expenses) decreased $1.4 million, or 9.0%, during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 from the comparable period in 2016. The decrease in other expenses was primarily attributable to a reinsurance expense-reimbursement allowance associated with the reinsurance agreement in the life and health operations, which reimbursed a portion of the Company's indirect underwriting expenses; a $0.4 million decrease in the variable commission accrual in the property and casualty operations; and a $0.3 million decrease in incentive compensation accruals from the comparable 2016 period due to the Company's recent operating performance. On a consolidated basis, as a percentage of earned premiums, other expenses decreased to 33.8% in the three month period ended March 31, 2017 from 39.5% in the three month period ended March 31, 2016. The decrease in the expense ratio was primarily attributable to the increase in earned premiums coupled with a lower level of general and administrative expenses. INCOME TAXES The primary difference between the effective tax rate and the federal statutory income tax rate for the three month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 resulted from the dividends-received deduction (""DRD""). The current estimated DRD is adjusted as underlying factors change and can vary from estimates based on, but not limited to, actual distributions from investments as well as the amount of the Company's taxable income. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary cash needs of the Company are for the payment of claims and operating expenses, maintaining adequate statutory capital and surplus levels, and meeting debt service requirements. Current and expected patterns of claim frequency and severity may change from period to period but generally are expected to continue within historical ranges. The Company's primary sources of cash are written premiums, investment income and proceeds from the sale and maturity of its invested assets. The Company believes that, within each operating company, total invested assets will be sufficient to satisfy all policy liabilities and that cash inflows from investment earnings, future premium receipts and reinsurance collections will be adequate to fund the payment of claims and expenses as needed. Cash flows at the Parent are derived from dividends, management fees, and tax-sharing payments, as described below, from the subsidiaries. The principal cash needs of the Parent are for the payment of operating expenses, the acquisition of capital assets and debt service requirements, as well as the repurchase of shares and payments of any dividends as may be authorized and approved by the Company's board of directors from time to time. At March 31, 2017, the Parent had approximately $21.8 million of unrestricted cash and investments. -23- Table of Contents Over 90% of the invested assets of the Parent's insurance subsidiaries are invested in marketable securities that can be converted into cash, if required; however, the use of such assets by the Company is limited by state insurance regulations. Dividend payments to a parent corporation by its wholly owned insurance subsidiaries are subject to annual limitations and are restricted to 10% of statutory surplus or statutory earnings before recognizing realized investment gains of the individual insurance subsidiaries. At March 31, 2017, American Southern had $42.3 million of statutory surplus and Bankers Fidelity had $31.0 million of statutory surplus. In 2017, dividend payments by the Parent's insurance subsidiaries in excess of $5.7 million would require prior approval. Through March 31, 2017, the Parent received dividends of $1.2 million from its subsidiaries. The Parent provides certain administrative and other services to each of its insurance subsidiaries. The amounts charged to and paid by the subsidiaries include reimbursements for various shared services and other expenses incurred directly on behalf of the subsidiaries by the Parent. In addition, there is in place a formal tax-sharing agreement between the Parent and its insurance subsidiaries. As a result of the Parent's tax loss, it is anticipated that the tax-sharing agreement will continue to provide the Parent with additional funds from profitable subsidiaries to assist in meeting its cash flow obligations. The Company has two statutory trusts which exist for the exclusive purpose of issuing trust preferred securities representing undivided beneficial interests in the assets of the trusts and investing the gross proceeds of the trust preferred securities in Junior Subordinated Debentures. The outstanding $18.0 million and $15.7 million of Junior Subordinated Debentures mature on December 4, 2032 and May 15, 2033, respectively, are callable quarterly, in whole or in part, only at the option of the Company, and have an interest rate of three-month LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The margin ranges from 4.00% to 4.10%. At March 31, 2017, the effective interest rate was 5.12%. The obligations of the Company with respect to the issuances of the trust preferred securities represent a full and unconditional guarantee by the Parent of each trust's obligations with respect to the trust preferred securities. Subject to certain exceptions and limitations, the Company may elect from time to time to defer Junior Subordinated Debenture interest payments, which would result in a deferral of distribution payments on the related trust preferred securities. The Company has not made such an election. The Company intends to pay its obligations under the Junior Subordinated Debentures using existing cash balances, dividend and tax-sharing payments from the operating subsidiaries, or from potential future financing arrangements. At March 31, 2017, the Company had 55,000 shares of Series D preferred stock (""Series D Preferred Stock"") outstanding. All of the shares of Series D Preferred Stock are held by an affiliate of the Company's controlling shareholder. The outstanding shares of Series D Preferred Stock have a stated value of $100 per share; accrue annual dividends at a rate of $7.25 per share (payable in cash or shares of the Company's common stock at the option of the board of directors of the Company) and are cumulative. In certain circumstances, the shares of the Series D Preferred Stock may be convertible into an aggregate of approximately 1,378,000 shares of the Company's common stock, subject to certain adjustments and provided that such adjustments do not result in the Company issuing more than approximately 2,703,000 shares of common stock without obtaining prior shareholder approval; and are redeemable solely at the Company's option. The Series D Preferred Stock is not currently convertible. At March 31, 2017, the Company had accrued but unpaid dividends on the Series D Preferred Stock totaling $0.1 million. Cash and cash equivalents decreased from $13.3 million at December 31, 2016 to $10.7 million at March 31, 2017. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was primarily attributable to net cash used in operating activities of $6.1 million, additions to property and equipment of $0.1 million and the purchase of shares for treasury for $0.1 million. Partially offsetting the decrease in cash and cash equivalents was a $3.8 million increase resulting from the sale and maturity of securities exceeding investment purchases. The Company believes that existing cash balances as well as the dividends, fees, and tax-sharing payments it expects to receive from its subsidiaries and, if needed, additional borrowings from financial institutions, will enable the Company to meet its liquidity requirements for the foreseeable future. Management is not aware of any current recommendations by regulatory authorities, which, if implemented, would have a material adverse effect on the Company's liquidity, capital resources or operations. -24- Table of Contents May 12, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

AAME,"ATLANTA, Mar 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Atlantic American Corporation AAME, +3.13% today reported its results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. For the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company reported net income of $2.5 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, up from $1.3 million, or $0.06 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase was attributable to an increase in realized investment gains of $5.2 million during the fourth quarter of 2017. Premiums for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 10.6% to $40.3 million compared to $36.5 million for the fourth quarter of 2016, primarily as a result of premium growth in the Medicare supplement line of business in the life and health operation. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $4.5 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, as compared to $2.6 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. Total premiums earned during 2017 increased 6.4% to $163.3 million from $153.5 million in 2016. Premiums in the property and casualty operation decreased slightly in 2017 as compared to 2016; but were offset by a 10.0% premium increase in the life and health operations in the comparable years. Benefits and losses increased 13.9% in 2017 as compared with 2016; while commissions and underwriting expenses decreased 3.0% over the comparable prior year period. Realized investment gains were $9.2 million in 2017 as compared to $2.6 million in 2016. Commenting on the results, Hilton H. Howell, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer, stated, ""We are delighted to close out another profitable year and are enthusiastic about our prospects for 2018. In the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company reported a significant realized gain due to the conclusion of one of the Company's real estate partnerships. While the life and health operation experienced some growing pains over the last year, we have completed a number of strategic pricing adjustments for our Medicare supplement product and expect loss experience trends to normalize. Our property and casualty operation continues to perform exceedingly well and reported an improvement in net income over the prior year. In recognition of our enthusiasm for 2018, our Board of Directors recently approved our 7th consecutive annual dividend of $0.02 per share to shareholders of record on April 13, 2018, payable on or about April 23, 2018.""

AAME,"OLDWICK, N.J., Mar 01, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- A.M. Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of “a” of American Southern Insurance Company (Topeka, KS) and its wholly owned and 100% reinsured subsidiary, American Safety Insurance Company (collectively referred to as American Southern Group). Additionally, A.M. Best has affirmed the FSR of A-(Excellent) and the Long-Term ICR of “a-” of Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company and Bankers Fidelity Assurance Company (collectively referred to as Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Group [BFLIG]. The outlooks of these Credit Ratings (ratings) are stable. All companies are domiciled Atlanta GA, unless otherwise specified. Concurrently, A.M. Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of “bbb-” of the parent company, Atlantic American Corporation (Atlantic American) AAME, +3.13% The outlooks of these ratings remain stable. The ratings reflect American Southern Group’s balance sheet strength, which A.M. Best categorizes as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM). The ratings also reflect the group’s long history of operating profitability, management’s disciplined underwriting approach and its local market knowledge. American Southern Group’s balance sheet strength assessment reflects risk-adjusted capitalization that is at the strongest level, as measured by Best’s Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR) model, partially offset by the group’s payment of substantial stockholder dividends, which historically have been used to service debt held at Atlantic American. The ratings also consider the financial leverage and interest coverage at Atlantic American, with its adjusted debt-to-total capital at 16.3% as of Sept. 30, 2017. Interest coverage historically has been supported adequately by the insurance operating companies’ ability to generate sufficient earnings to cover obligations at the parent. Negative rating actions could occur for American Southern Group if there is significant deterioration in underwriting results over the near term, or if risk-adjusted capitalization declines significantly. The ratings of BFLIG consider its balance sheet strength, which is categorized as very strong, combined with its marginal operating performance, a neutral business profile and its appropriate ERM. In the rating of BFLIG, A.M. Best has considered the execution of BFLIG’s modernization of overall operations. Management has taken these steps with the hopes of achieving better competitive positioning as newly designed products and a multi-phased expansion are being implemented, both into new markets and via broader based distribution channels. While BFLIG has exhibited higher premium revenue development over the last year, there has also been a negative development on the bottom line related to new business strain. Positive rating actions could occur for BFLIG if there is a sustained positive earnings trend. Negative rating action could occur if there is a material weakening in its risk-adjusted capitalization. This press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on A.M. Best’s website.

AAME,"ATLANTA, May 12, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Atlantic American Corporation AAME, +3.13% today reported a first quarter 2017 net loss of $0.2 million, or $0.02 per common share, as compared to net income of $0.9 million, or $0.04 per common share, in the first quarter of 2016.  Realized investment gains during the first quarter of 2017 were $0.9 million as compared to $0.8 million in the first quarter of 2016.  The net loss was attributable to higher than expected levels of claims in both life and health lines of business.  Most notable were the early season Medicare Supplement Part B deductible reimbursements on new business which have not yet been through an annual earnings cycle.  Total insurance premiums for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 increased 6.0% to $40.8 million as compared to $38.5 million in the first quarter of 2016; while Medicare Supplement premiums increased 14.1% during the comparable period to $23.9 million from $20.9 million.  Total revenues were $43.9 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $41.7 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Commenting on the quarter, Hilton H. Howell, Jr., chairman, president and chief executive officer, stated, ""We continue to move forward with great optimism and confidence in our business strategies.  Our Worksite/Group division was officially launched in the first quarter and is experiencing an encouraging level of sales.  Our Individual division has recently released a new hospital indemnity product that we feel will have high market acceptance.  Diversification of our sales portfolio continues to be a primary focus.  We expect that the increased level of Medicare supplement benefit expenses and life insurance claims we experienced in the first quarter will moderate naturally and historically, thus allowing us to return to expected levels of profitability throughout the remainder of the year.  Our property and casualty operations continue to perform well and we look forward to better quarters in the balance of the year.""
