OVERVIEW The Company is a leading manufacturer of flexible metal hose, and is currently engaged in a number of different markets, including construction, manufacturing, transportation, petrochemical, pharmaceutical and other industries. The Company's business is managed as a single operating segment that consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and accessories. The Company's products are concentrated in residential and commercial construction, and general industrial markets, with a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property and patents issued in various countries around the world. The Company's primary product, flexible gas piping, is used for gas piping within residential and commercial buildings. Through its flexibility and ease of use, the Company's TracPipe(R) and TracPipe(R) CounterStrike(R) flexible gas piping, along with its fittings distributed under the trademarks AutoSnap(R) and AutoFlare(R), allows users to substantially cut the time required to install gas piping, as compared to traditional methods. The Company's products are manufactured at its Exton, Pennsylvania facilities in the United States, and in Banbury, Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom. A majority of the Company's sales across all industries are generated through independent outside sales organizations such as sales representatives, wholesalers and distributors, or a combination of both. The Company has a broad distribution network in North America and to a lesser extent in other global markets. CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION The Company's cash balance of $37,938,000 at December 31, 2017, increased $2,620,000 (7.4%) from the $35,318,000 balance at December 31, 2016. The Company paid a dividend of $8,578,000 during the first quarter of 2017 which was accrued at December 31, 2016, and also purchased a building in Exton, PA for approximately $2,500,000 in February 2017. In July and October 2017, the Company paid dividends each in the amount of $2,220,000, as detailed in Note 6, ""Shareholders' Equity"". Those cash outflows were partially offset by income generated from operations during 2017. Property and Equipment - Net was $6,998,000 at December 31, 2017, compared to $4,402,000 at December 31, 2016, increasing $2,596,000 (59.0%). As noted above, the Company purchased a building in Exton, PA for approximately $2,500,000. This facility was previously leased. Dividends Payable was $2,220,000 and $8,578,000 at December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, decreasing $6,358,000 (74.1%). On June 9, 2017, the Company announced that it would begin paying regular quarterly dividends. On December 13, 2017, the Company declared its third regular quarterly dividend of the year in the amount of $0.22 per share, which was then paid to shareholders in January 2018. At December 31, 2016, Dividends Payable reflected the $0.85 special dividend per share declared by the Board earlier that month. This dividend was then paid to shareholders in January of 2017, thus reducing the cash balance, as described above. A full discussion of dividends is provided in Note 6, ""Shareholders' Equity"". -18- RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Twelve-months ended December 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016 The Company reported comparative results from operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 as follows: Twelve-months ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 2016 Net Sales $ 101,799 100.0 % $ 94,051 100.0 % Gross Profit $ 61,766 60.7 % $ 57,884 61.5 % Operating Profit $ 24,217 23.8 % $ 21,897 23.3 %  Net Sales. The Company's sales for the full year of 2017 were $101,799,000, reflecting an increase of $7,748,000, or 8.2% over the $94,051,000 of sales generated in 2016. The majority of the increase was related to an increase in unit volume, combined with higher sales prices that were necessary to help offset a rise in the Company's material costs. Gross Profit. The Company's gross profit margins decreased slightly between the two periods, being 60.7% and 61.5% for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Selling Expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs, commissions, and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising, trade shows and related communication costs, and freight. Selling expense was $16,359,000 and $15,694,000 for 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing a year over year increase of $665,000 or 4.2%. The increase was primarily attributable to a rise in freight and commissions, which change in conjunction with sales unit volume. For the same periods, selling expense as a percentage of Net Sales was 16.1% and 16.7%, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits for administrative, executive and finance personnel, legal and accounting, insurance, and corporate general and administrative services. General and administrative expenses were $17,897,000 and $17,108,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing $789,000 (4.6%) between periods. This included an increase in incentive compensation partially due to the increase in profits, and also related to the Company's phantom stock plan, mainly resulting from an increase in the Company's stock price. There was also an increase in insurance costs. The impact of these costs were however tempered by a decrease in legal and product liability related defense costs. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 17.6% and 18.2% for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Engineering Expense. Engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products, and costs related to enhancements of existing products and manufacturing processes. Engineering expenses increased $108,000 or 3.4% between periods, being $3,293,000 and $3,185,000 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The change was primarily related to an increase in staffing. As a percentage of sales for the year, Engineering expense was 3.2% in 2017 and 3.4% in 2016. Operating Profit. Reflecting all of the factors mentioned above, Operating Profits increased $2,320,000 or 10.6%, ending with a profit of $24,217,000 in 2017, compared to $21,897,000 in 2016. Interest Income. Interest income is recorded on cash investments, and interest expense is recorded at times when the Company has debt amounts outstanding on its line of credit. There was $117,000 of interest income recorded during 2017 and $98,000 in 2016. -19- Other Expense. Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) on transactions with Omega Flex Limited, our United Kingdom (""UK"") subsidiary. During 2016, the British Pound weakened, largely as a result of the UK's vote to exit the European Union. As a result, the Company recognized currency related losses of $474,000 for 2016. The British Pound stabilized during 2017, and therefore the Company only recognized a loss of $38,000 during the year. Income Tax Expense. Income Tax Expense was $8,450,000 for the full year 2017, compared to $6,975,000 for the same period in 2016, increasing by $1,475,000 (21.1%). As outlined in Note 7, ""Income Taxes"", the Company recognized a one-time tax charge of $709,000 during the fourth quarter of 2017 primarily related to unremitted foreign earnings resulting from the recent change in the tax code. The remainder of the increase was largely in correlation with the change in income before taxes. Excluding the previously described one-time tax charge, the Company's effective tax rate in 2017 approximates the 2016 rate and does not differ materially from expected statutory rates. Twelve-months ended December 31, 2016 vs. December 31, 2015 The Company reported comparative results from operations for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 as follows: Twelve-months ended December 31, (dollars in thousands) 2016 2016 2015 2015 Net Sales $ 94,051 100.0 % $ 93,278 100.0 % Gross Profit $ 57,884 61.5 % $ 57,146 61.3 % Operating Profit $ 21,897 23.3 % $ 23,503 25.2 %  Net Sales. The Company's sales for the full year of 2016 were $94,051,000, representing an increase of $773,000, or 0.8% over the $93,278,000 generated in 2015. The Company believes that some customers purchased ahead during the fourth quarter of 2015, which eroded sales from the first quarter of 2016, most notably January 2016. The Company was however able to make up that shortfall during the remaining months of the year through diversification and by expanding its relationships with other customers. Gross Profit. The Company's gross profit margins increased between the two periods, being 61.5% and 61.3% for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Selling Expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs, commissions, and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising, trade shows and related communication costs, and freight. Selling expense was $15,694,000 and $15,252,000 for 2016 and 2015, respectively, representing a year over year increase of $442,000 or 2.9%, primarily attributable to increases in commissions and staffing. For the same periods, selling expense as a percentage of Net Sales was 16.7% and 16.4%, respectively. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits for administrative, executive and finance personnel, legal and accounting, insurance, and corporate general and administrative services. General and administrative expenses were $17,108,000 and $15,707,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively, increasing $1,401,000 (8.9%) between periods. The majority of the increase in 2016 pertained to legal and insurance related expenses primarily associated with product liability claims and umbrella coverage, as the Company waged a heightened and vigorous defense on a couple of claims that have since been resolved or dismissed by the courts. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses increased to 18.2% for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2016 from 16.8% for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2015. Engineering Expense. Engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products, and costs related to enhancements of existing products and manufacturing processes. Engineering expenses increased $501,000 or 18.7% between periods, as they were $3,185,000 and $2,684,000 for the twelve-months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. The change was primarily related to an increase in staffing for various project initiatives. As a percentage of sales for the year, Engineering expenses were 3.4% in 2016 and 2.9% in 2015. -20- Operating Profit. Reflecting all of the factors mentioned above, Operating Profits were down $1,606,000 or 6.8%, ending with a profit of $21,897,000 in 2016, compared to $23,503,000 in 2015. Interest Income. Interest income is recorded on cash investments, and interest expense is recorded at times when the Company has debt amounts outstanding on its line of credit. There was $98,000 of interest income recorded during 2016 and $73,000 in 2015. Other Expense. Other Expense primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) on transactions with our United Kingdom subsidiaries. During June of 2016, the British Pound weakened, largely as a result of the UK's vote to exit the European Union, also known as ""Brexit"", and showed continued weakness through the remainder of the year. As a result, the Company recognized currency related losses of $474,000 during 2016. In 2015, the Company recognized Other Expense of only $12,000. Income Tax Expense. Income Tax Expense was $6,975,000 for the full year 2016, compared to $7,603,000 for the same period in 2015, decreasing by $628,000 (8.3%), largely in correlation with the change in income before taxes. The Company's effective tax rate in 2016 approximates the 2015 rate and does not differ materially from expected statutory rates. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES See Note 10 to the Company's financial statements for a detailed description of Commitments and Contingencies. FUTURE IMPACT OF KNOWN TRENDS OR UNCERTAINTIES The Company's operations are sensitive to a number of market and extrinsic factors, any one of which could materially adversely affect the Company's business, competitive position, results of operations or financial condition in any given year. See Item 1A, Risk Factors, for a detailed description. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES Note 2 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition, accounts receivable allowances, inventory valuations, goodwill valuation, product liability costs, phantom stock and accounting for income taxes. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. Our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows: Revenue Recognition The Company's revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and pipe. Under GAAP, revenues are considered to have been earned when the Company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues. The following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue: ? Persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of product or services must exist. ? Delivery has occurred or services rendered. ? The sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable. ? Collection is reasonably assured. -21- The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment in accordance with the above principles. Gross sales are reduced for all consideration paid to customers for which no identifiable benefit is received by the Company. This includes promotional incentives, which includes various programs including year-end rebates, and payment term discounts. The amounts of certain incentives are known with reasonable certainty at the time of sale, while others are projected based upon the most reliable information available at the reporting date. Commissions are accounted for as a selling expense. Accounts Receivable and Provision for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. While management believes the allowance to be adequate, if the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company generally considers inventory quantities beyond two years of non-usage, measured on a historical usage basis, to be excess inventory and reduces the gross carrying value of inventory accordingly. Goodwill In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the Company performed an annual impairment test in accordance with this guidance as of December 31, 2017 and also at December 31, 2016. These analyses did not indicate any impairment of goodwill at the end of either period. Stock Based Compensation Plans In 2006, the Company adopted a Phantom Stock Plan (the ""Plan""), which allows the Company to grant phantom stock units (Units) to certain key employees, officers or directors. The Units each represent a contractual right to payment of compensation in the future based upon the market value of the Company's common stock. The Units follow a vesting schedule of three years from the grant date, and are then paid upon maturity. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method for determining the fair value of the Units. Further details of the Plan are provided in Note 11. Product Liability Reserves Product liability reserves represent the estimated unpaid amounts under the Company's insurance policies with respect to existing claims. The Company uses the most current available data to estimate claims. As explained more fully under Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies, for various product liability claims covered under the Company's general liability insurance policies, the Company must pay certain defense and settlement costs within its deductible or self-insured retention limits, ranging primarily from $25,000 to $1,000,000 per claim, depending on the terms of the policy in the applicable policy year, up to an aggregate amount. The Company is vigorously defending against all known claims. Fair Value of Financial and Nonfinancial Instruments The Company measures financial instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The accounting standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard creates a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company relies on its actively traded share value - a level 1 input - in determining the fair value of the reporting unit in its annual impairment test as described in the FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. -22- Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per share have been computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For the periods presented, there are no dilutive securities. Consequently, basic and dilutive earnings per share are the same. Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet dates. The Statements of Operations are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of financial statements are excluded from the determination of income and are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the Statements of Operations (other income (expense)) in the period in which they occur. Income Taxes The Company accounts for tax liabilities in accordance with ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under this method the Company recorded tax expense, related deferred taxes and tax benefits, and uncertainties in tax positions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize the benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain. Also, in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 740, the Company reviewed the need for a reserve for uncertainties in tax positions at both December 31, 2017 and 2016, with no reserve necessary. These reserves are reviewed each quarter. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company's primary cash needs have been related to working capital items, which the Company has largely funded through cash generated from operations. With regards to liquidity and capital resources, the Company had a cash balance of $37,938,000 at December 31, 2017, and also has the full use of a $15,000,000 line of credit available with Santander Bank, as discussed in detail in Note 5. At December 31, 2016, the Company had cash of $35,318,000. Operating Activities Cash provided by operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities, such as those included in working capital. For 2017, the Company's cash provided from operating activities was $18,048,000, compared to $14,758,000 of cash provided during 2016, thus increasing by $3,290,000 between periods. With regards to creating the generation of cash, the Company grew Net Income by $1,300,000, which increased cash, additionally, there were increases in cash attributable to Other Assets, Accrued Commissions and Sales Incentives and Accrued Compensation of $1,947,000, $1,188,000 and $762,000, respectively. Last year, the Company posted a $1,600,000 security deposit to proceed with further hearings related to the Company's 2010 Pennsylvania Claim (See discussion in Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), which was recorded in Other Assets, while there was no such event in the current year. Accrued Commissions and Sales Incentives typically fluctuate based upon sales volume, and our customer's ability to achieve sales growth over the previous year. A substantial portion of the sales incentives programs are accrued though the year, and paid in the following year. The accrual for sales incentives was higher in 2015, thus leading to higher payouts in 2016, while the accrual at the end of the year in 2016 and eventual payout in 2017 was not as significant. The accrual for sales incentives for 2017 was higher than in 2016 mainly the result of higher sales. As to Accrued Compensation, the accrual for 2017 is higher mainly the result of incentive compensation earned in association with the stronger profits generated during the year. The more significant decreases to cash from operating activities related to Accounts Receivable and Inventory, which decreased $1,719,000 and $1,243,000, respectively. Regarding inventory, the Company had a program in place during 2016 to reduce inventory levels, while the inventory purchases during 2017 are of a more normal nature. The reduction in Accounts Receivable was mostly timing related based upon payment terms and normal cash collection. A greater portion of cash generated from sales during the last portion of 2015 flowed into 2016 than was experienced with cash collection in 2017 from 2016 sales. -23- For 2016, the Company's cash provided from operating activities was $14,758,000, compared to $13,250,000 of cash provided during 2015, thus increasing by $1,508,000 between periods. With regards to creating the generation of cash, it was recognized that the timing of accounts receivable cash collections was accelerated, and there was also a decrease in inventory purchases. These items were partially offset by the posting of security to proceed with further hearings related to the Company's 2010 Pennsylvania Claim, which is under appeal (See Note 10, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements), and there was an increase in disbursements of Sales Incentives as more customers were able to achieve growth tiers in 2015, enabling greater payouts in 2016. As a general trend, the Company tends to deplete cash early in the year, as significant payments are typically made for accrued promotional incentives, incentive compensation, and taxes. Cash has then historically shown a tendency to be restored and accumulated during the latter portion of the year. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities during 2017 and 2016 was $3,093,000 and $233,000, respectively. This was all related to capital expenditures for both periods. Capital expenditures during 2017 mainly related to the purchase of a 30,000 square foot facility in Exton, Pennsylvania for cash during the first quarter of 2017, which required a cash outlay of approximately $2,500,000. This facility was previously under lease through January 2018. The remainder of capital expenditures related primarily to the purchase of machinery. During 2016, the Company's capital expenditures mainly related to information technology and machinery. During 2015, the Company proceeded with extensive . . .

OVERVIEW The Company is a leading manufacturer of flexible metal hose, and is currently engaged in a number of different markets, including construction, manufacturing, petrochemical transfer, pharmaceutical and other industries. The Company's business is managed as a single operating segment that consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and accessories. The Company's products are concentrated in residential and commercial construction, and general industrial markets, with a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property and patents issued in various countries around the world. The Company's primary product, flexible gas piping, is used for gas piping within residential and commercial buildings. Through its flexibility and ease of use, the Company's TracPipe(R) and TracPipe(R) CounterStrike(R) flexible gas piping, along with its fittings distributed under the trademarks AutoSnap(R) and AutoFlare(R), allows users to substantially cut the time required to install gas piping, as compared to traditional methods. The Company's products are primarily manufactured at its Exton, Pennsylvania facilities in the United States, and in Banbury, Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom. A majority of the Company's sales across all industries are generated through independent outside sales organizations such as sales representatives, wholesalers and distributors, or a combination of both. The Company has a broad distribution network in North America and to a lesser extent in other global markets. CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION The Company's cash balance of $31,607,000 at September 30, 2017, decreased $3,711,000 (10.5%) from the $35,318,000 balance at December 31, 2016. The Company paid a dividend of $8,578,000 during the first quarter of 2017 which was accrued at December 31, 2016, and also purchased a building in Exton, PA for approximately $2,500,000 in February 2017. In July of 2017, the Company paid another dividend in the amount of $2,220,000, as detailed below, and in Note 6, ""Shareholders' Equity"". Those cash outflows were partially offset by income generated from operations during 2017. Property and Equipment was $7,017,000 at September 30, 2017, compared to $4,402,000 at December 31, 2016, increasing $2,615,000 (59.4%). As noted above, the Company purchased a building in Exton, PA for approximately $2,500,000. This facility was previously leased. -21- Dividends Payable was $2,220,000 and $8,578,000 at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, decreasing $6,358,000 (74.1%). On June 9, 2017, the Company announced that it would pay a regular quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.22 per share, which was then paid to shareholders in July 2017. At December 31, 2016, Dividends Payable reflected the $0.85 special dividend per share declared by the Board earlier that month. This dividend was then paid to shareholders in January of 2017, thus reducing the cash balance, as described above.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three-months ended September 30, 2017 vs. September 30, 2016 The Company reported comparative results from operations for the three-months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 as follows: Three-months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 2016 ($000) ($000) Net Sales $ 24,923 100.0 % $ 23,942 100.0 % Gross Profit $ 15,207 61.0 % $ 14,777 61.7 % Operating Profit $ 5,910 23.7 % $ 5,847 24.4 %  Net Sales. The Company's 2017 third quarter net sales (sales) of $24,923,000 were $981,000 (4.1%) higher than the third quarter of 2016, which were $23,942,000. It should be noted that the increase in sales has been accomplished despite higher sales deductions for items such as promotional incentive costs, as more customers have been able to earn higher payouts based upon growth. Gross Profit. The Company's gross profit margins for the three-months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, were largely consistent, being 61.0% and 61.7%, respectively. Selling Expense. Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs, commissions, and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising, trade shows and related communication costs, and freight. Selling expense was $4,004,000 and $3,913,000 for the three-months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of $91,000 (2.3%). As a percent of sales, Selling expenses were 16.1% for the three-months ended September 30, 2017, compared to 16.3% for the three-months ended September 30, 2016. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits for administrative, executive and finance personnel, legal and accounting, insurance, and corporate general and administrative services. General and administrative expenses were $4,495,000 and $4,209,000 for the three-months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing $286,000 or 6.8% between periods. The increase was related to various factors, including additional expenses accrued related to the Company's phantom stock plan, resulting primarily from an increase in the Company's stock price, and there was also an increase in insurance costs. The impact of these costs were however softened by a decrease in legal and product liability related defense costs. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 18.0% and 17.6% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. -22- Engineering Expense. Engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products, and costs related to enhancements of existing products and manufacturing processes. Engineering expenses were $798,000 and $808,000 for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were 3.2% and 3.4% for the three months ended September 30, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Operating Profit. Reflecting all of the factors mentioned above, operating profits increased by $63,000, or 1.0% compared to last year. The Company had a profit of $5,910,000 in the three-month period ended September 30, 2017, versus a profit of $5,847,000 in the three-months ended September 30, 2016. Interest Income. Interest income is recorded on cash investments, and when applicable, interest expense is recorded at times when the Company has debt amounts outstanding on its line of credit. The Company recognized a modest amount of interest income for the third quarter of 2017 and 2016. Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) on transactions with Omega Flex Limited, our United Kingdom (""UK"") subsidiary. During 2016, the British Pound weakened, largely as a result of the UK's vote to exit the European Union. As a result, the Company recognized currency related losses of $110,000 for the third quarter of 2016. The British Pound has stabilized during 2017 and for the third quarter of 2017, the Company recognized $4,000 of other income. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $1,895,000 for the third quarter of 2017, compared to $1,848,000 for the same period in 2016. The $47,000 increase was primarily due to higher income before taxes. The Company's effective tax rate in 2017 approximates the 2016 rate and does not differ materially from expected statutory rates. -23-  Nine-months ended September 30, 2017 vs. September 30, 2016 The Company reported comparative results from operations for the nine-months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016 as follows: Nine-months ended September 30, (in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 2016 ($000) ($000) Net Sales $ 74,335 100.0 % $ 68,408 100.0 % Gross Profit $ 44,685 60.1 % $ 41,958 61.3 % Operating Profit $ 16,549 22.3 % $ 15,561 22.8 %  Net Sales. The Company's sales for the first nine months of 2017 increased $5,927,000, or 8.7% over the same period in 2016, ending at $74,335,000 and $68,408,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The majority of the sales growth is the result of an increase in unit volume. It should be noted that the increase in sales has been accomplished despite higher sales deductions for items such as promotional incentive costs, as more customers have been able to earn higher payouts based upon growth. Gross Profit. The Company's gross profit margins were reasonably similar between years, being 60.1% and 61.3% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company incurred higher raw material costs during the first nine months of 2017 in comparison to the same period last year, but has been able to largely offset this imbalance through its own pricing actions. Selling Expense. Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs, commissions, and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising, trade shows and related communication costs, and freight. Selling expense was $12,356,000 and $11,666,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of $690,000 or 5.9%. There was an increase in freight and commissions, which largely move in relation to sales, and there were also additional staffing related expenses. Selling expense as a percent of sales was 16.6% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2017, and 17.1% for the nine-months ended September 30, 2016. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits for administrative, executive and finance personnel, legal and accounting, insurance, and corporate general and administrative services. General and administrative expenses were $13,312,000 and $12,432,000 for the nine-months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing $880,000 (7.1%) between periods. Incentive compensation was higher primarily as a result of higher profits, and there were additional expenses incurred related to the Company's phantom stock plan, resulting primarily from an increase in the Company's stock price. To a lesser extent, the Company also recognized an increase in insurance costs. The impact of those items were however softened by a decrease in legal and product liability related defense costs, which were higher during the first nine months of 2016 due to a few specific matters which required a heightened defense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 17.9% and 18.2% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. -24- Engineering Expense. Engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products, and costs related to enhancements of existing products and manufacturing processes. Engineering expenses increased $169,000 or 7.4% between periods, as they were $2,468,000 and $2,299,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Engineering expenses were largely consistent as a percentage of sales, being 3.3% and 3.4% for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Operating Profit. Reflecting all of the factors mentioned above, operating profits were up $988,000 or 6.4%, ending with a profit of $16,549,000 for the first nine months of 2017, compared to $15,561,000 during the same period in 2016. Interest Income. Interest income is recorded on cash investments, and when applicable, interest expense is recorded at times when the Company has debt amounts outstanding on its line of credit. There was $76,000 of interest income recorded during the first nine months of 2017, and $68,000 during the same period in 2016. Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) on transactions with Omega Flex Limited, our UK subsidiary. During 2016, the British Pound weakened, largely as a result of the UK's vote to exit the European Union. As a result, the Company recognized currency related losses of $288,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The British Pound has stabilized in 2017, and during the first nine months of 2017, the Company recognized a loss of only $18,000. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $5,294,000 for the first nine months of 2017, compared to $4,980,000 for the same period in 2016, increasing by $314,000, largely in correlation with the change in income before taxes. The Company's effective tax rate in 2017 approximates the 2016 rate and does not differ materially from expected statutory rates. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES Financial Reporting Release No. 60, released by the Securities and Exchange Commission, requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a brief discussion of the Company's more significant accounting policies. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition and related sales incentives, accounts receivable allowances, inventory valuations, goodwill valuation, product liability reserve, stock-based compensation valuations and accounting for income taxes. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. -25- Our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows: Revenue Recognition The Company's revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and pipe. Under GAAP, revenues are considered to have been earned when the Company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues. The following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue: Persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of product or services must exist. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment in accordance with the above principles. Gross sales are reduced for all consideration paid to customers for which no identifiable benefit is received by the Company. This includes promotional incentives, which includes various programs including year-end rebates and discounts. The amounts of certain incentives are known with reasonable certainty at the time of sale, while others are projected based upon the most reliable information available at the reporting date. Commissions are accounted for as a sales expense. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include investments in an institutional money market fund, which invests in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds, and/or repurchase agreements, backed by such obligations. Carrying value approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited at various area banks, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company monitors the viability of the banking institutions carrying its assets on a regular basis, and has the ability to transfer cash to various institutions during times of risk. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these cash balances, and believes its credit risk to be minimal. Accounts Receivable and Provision for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. While management believes the allowance to be adequate, if the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. -26- The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on any known collection issues, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. The reserve for future credits, discounts, and doubtful accounts was $912,000 and $926,000 as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In regards to identifying uncollectible accounts, the Company reviews an aging report on a consistent basis to determine past due accounts, and utilizes a well established credit rating agency. The Company charges off those accounts that are deemed uncollectible once all collection efforts have been exhausted. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company generally considers inventory quantities beyond two-years usage, measured on a historical usage basis, to be excess inventory and reduces the carrying value of inventory accordingly. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, for leasehold improvements, the life of the lease, if shorter. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in other income or expense for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred; significant improvements are capitalized. Goodwill In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the Company performed an annual impairment test in accordance with this guidance as of December 31, 2016. This analysis did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. There were no circumstances that indicate that Goodwill might be impaired at September 30, 2017. Stock-Based Compensation Plans In 2006, the Company adopted a Phantom Stock Plan (the ""Plan""), which allows the Company to grant phantom stock units (Units) to certain key employees, officers or directors. The Units each represent a contractual right to payment of compensation in the future based upon the market value of the Company's common stock. The Units follow a vesting schedule of three years from the grant date, and are then paid upon maturity. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method for determining the fair value of the Units. Further details of the Plan are provided in Note 6. -27- Product Liability Reserves Product liability reserves represent the estimated unpaid amounts under the Company's insurance policies with respect to existing claims. The Company uses the most current available data to estimate claims. As explained more fully under Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies, for various product liability claims covered under the Company's general liability insurance policies, the Company must pay certain defense costs within its deductible or self-insured retention limits, ranging primarily from $25,000 to $1,000,000 per claim, depending on the terms of the policy in the applicable policy year, up to an aggregate amount. The Company is vigorously defending against all known claims. Fair Value of Financial and Nonfinancial Instruments The Company measures financial instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The accounting standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard creates a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company relies on its actively traded share value - a Level 1 input - in determining the fair value of the reporting unit in its annual impairment test as described in the FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per share have been computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For the periods presented, there are no dilutive securities. Consequently, basic and dilutive earnings per share are the same. Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, most of which relate to our United Kingdom subsidiary whose functional currency is British pound sterling, are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet dates. The statements of income are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of financial statements are excluded from the determination of income and are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of income (other income (expense)) in the period in which they occur. -28- Income Taxes The Company accounts for tax liabilities in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under this method the Company records tax expense, related deferred taxes and tax benefits, and uncertainties in tax positions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize the benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain. The FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company's financial statements. This guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10 relative to accounting for uncertainties in tax positions. These provisions provide guidance on the recognition, de-recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions. The Company elected to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. For additional information regarding ASC 740-10, see Note 8 of the Company's December 31, 2016 Form 10-K. Other Comprehensive Income For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the components of other comprehensive income consisted solely of foreign currency translation adjustments. Significant Concentration The Company has one significant customer who represents more than 10% of the Company's Net Sales for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, and more than 10% of the Company's Accounts Receivable balance at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Geographically, the Company has a significant amount of sales in the United States versus internationally. These concentrations are discussed in detail in the Company's December 31, 2016 Form 10-K, and there has been no significant change as of this quarterly report. -29- Subsequent Events The Company evaluates all events or transactions through the date of the related filing that may have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 9 of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition . . . Nov 06, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

The Company's business is managed as a single operating segment that consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and accessories. The Company's products are concentrated in residential and commercial construction, and general industrial markets, with a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property and patents issued in various countries around the world. The Company's primary product, flexible gas piping, is used for gas piping within residential and commercial buildings. Through its flexibility and ease of use, the Company's TracPipe(R) and TracPipe(R) CounterStrike(R) flexible gas piping, along with its fittings distributed under the trademarks AutoSnap(R) and AutoFlare(R), allows users to substantially cut the time required to install gas piping, as compared to traditional methods. The Company's products are primarily manufactured at its Exton, Pennsylvania facilities in the United States, and in Banbury, Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom. A majority of the Company's sales across all industries are generated through independent outside sales organizations such as sales representatives, wholesalers and distributors, or a combination of both. The Company has a broad distribution network in North America and to a lesser extent in other global markets. CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION The Company's cash balance of $28,568,000 at June 30, 2017, decreased $6,750,000 (19.1%) from the $35,318,000 balance at December 31, 2016. The Company paid a dividend of $8,578,000 during the first quarter of 2017 which was accrued at December 31, 2016, and also purchased a building in Exton, PA for approximately $2,500,000 in February 2017. Additionally, consistent with prior years, the Company paid a significant amount of cash during the first quarter for items that were accrued as of the end of the preceding year, such as sales incentive programs and incentive compensation. Those cash outflows were partially offset by income generated from operations during 2017. Property and Equipment was $7,036,000 at June 30, 2017, compared to $4,402,000 at December 31, 2016, increasing $2,634,000 (59.8%). As noted above, the Company purchased a building in Exton, PA for approximately $2,500,000. This facility was previously leased. Accrued Compensation was $2,237,000 at June 30, 2017, compared to $4,319,000 at December 31, 2016, decreasing $2,082,000 (48.2%). A significant portion of the liability that existed at year end related to incentive compensation earned in 2016. As is customary, the liability was then paid during the first quarter of the following year, or 2017, thus diminishing the balance. The liability now represents amounts earned during the current year. -21- Dividends Payable was $2,220,000 and $8,578,000 at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, decreasing $6,358,000 (74.1%). On June 9, 2017, the Company announced that it would pay a regular quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.22 per share, which was then paid to shareholders in July 2017. At December 31, 2016, Dividends Payable reflected the $0.85 special dividend per share declared by the Board earlier that month. This dividend was then paid to shareholders in January of 2017. This also reduced the Company's cash balance, as described above.  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three-months ended June 30, 2017 vs. June 30, 2016 The Company reported comparative results from operations for the three-months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 as follows: Three-months ended June 30, (in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 2016 ($000) ($000) Net Sales $ 23,805 100.0 % $ 23,840 100.0 % Gross Profit $ 14,142 59.4 % $ 14,689 61.6 % Operating Profit $ 4,435 18.6 % $ 5,693 23.9 %  Net Sales. The Company's 2017 second quarter net sales (sales) of $23,805,000 were largely consistent with the second quarter of 2016, which were $23,840,000. Net Sales for the second quarter of 2017 were diminished primarily by an increase in customer promotional incentives. Gross Profit. The Company's gross profit margins were 59.4% and 61.6% for the three-months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company incurred higher raw material costs in comparison to the second quarter of 2016, which have been addressed through our own pricing actions to offset the imbalance. Selling Expense. Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs, commissions, and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising, trade shows and related communication costs, and freight. Selling expense was $4,046,000 and $3,900,000 for the three-months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of $146,000 (3.7%). As a percent of sales, Selling expenses were 17.0% for the three-months ended June 30, 2017, compared to 16.4% for the three-months ended June 30, 2016. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits for administrative, executive and finance personnel, legal and accounting, insurance, and corporate general and administrative services. General and administrative expenses were $4,799,000 and $4,317,000 for the three-months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing $482,000 or 11.2% between periods. The increase was related to various factors, including additional expenses accrued related to the Company's phantom stock plan, resulting primarily from an increase in the Company's stock price. To a lesser extent, the Company also recognized an increase in insurance costs. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses were 20.2% and 18.1% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. -22- Engineering Expense. Engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products, and costs related to enhancements of existing products and manufacturing processes. Engineering expenses increased $83,000 (10.7%) for the quarter. They were $862,000 and $779,000 for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Engineering expenses as a percentage of sales were 3.6% and 3.3% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and 2016, respectively. Operating Profit. Reflecting all of the factors mentioned above, operating profits decreased by $1,258,000, or 22.1% compared to last year. The Company had a profit of $4,435,000 in the three-month period ended June 30, 2017, versus a profit of $5,693,000 in the three-months ended June 30, 2016. Interest Income. Interest income is recorded on cash investments, and when applicable, interest expense is recorded at times when the Company has debt amounts outstanding on its line of credit. The Company recognized a modest amount of interest income for the second quarter of 2017 and 2016. Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) on transactions with Omega Flex Limited, our United Kingdom (""UK"") subsidiary. During June of 2016, the British Pound weakened, largely as a result of the UK's vote to exit the European Union. As a result the Company recognized currency related losses of $132,000 for the second quarter of 2016. The British Pound has stabilized during 2017 and for the second quarter of 2017, the Company recognized $18,000 of Other Income. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $1,394,000 for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $1,824,000 for the same period in 2016. The $430,000 decrease was primarily due to lower income before taxes. The Company's effective tax rate in 2017 approximates the 2016 rate and does not differ materially from expected statutory rates. -23-  Six-months ended June 30, 2017 vs. June 30, 2016 The Company reported comparative results from operations for the six-months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 as follows: Six-months ended June 30, (in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 2016 ($000) ($000) Net Sales $ 49,412 100.0 % $ 44,466 100.0 % Gross Profit $ 29,478 59.7 % $ 27,181 61.1 % Operating Profit $ 10,639 21.5 % $ 9,714 21.9 %  Net Sales. The Company's sales for the first six months of 2017 increased $4,946,000, or 11.1% over the same period in 2016, ending at $49,412,000 and $44,466,000 in 2017 and 2016, respectively. The majority of the sales growth is the result of an increase in unit volume. Gross Profit. The Company's gross profit margins have decreased between the two periods, being 59.7% and 61.1% for the six-months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company incurred higher raw material costs during the first half of 2017 in comparison to the same period last year, which have been addressed through the Company's own pricing actions to offset the imbalance. Selling Expense. Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs, commissions, and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising, trade shows and related communication costs, and freight. Selling expense was $8,352,000 and $7,753,000 for the six-months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of $599,000 or 7.7%. There was an increase in freight and commissions, which largely move in relation to sales, and there were also additional staffing related expenses. Selling expense as a percent of sales was 16.9% for the six-months ended June 30, 2017, and 17.4% for the six-months ended June 30, 2016. General and Administrative Expense. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits for administrative, executive and finance personnel, legal and accounting, insurance, and corporate general and administrative services. General and administrative expenses were $8,817,000 and $8,223,000 for the six-months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing $594,000 (7.2%) between periods. Incentive compensation was higher primarily as a result of higher profits, and there were additional expenses incurred related to the Company's phantom stock plan, resulting primarily from the recent increase in the Company's stock price. To a lesser extent, the Company also recognized an increase in insurance costs. The impact of those items were however softened by a decrease in legal and product liability related defense costs, which were higher during the first half of 2016 due to a few specific matters which required a heightened defense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses decreased to 17.8% for the six-months ended June 30, 2017 from 18.5% for the six months ended June 30, 2016. -24- Engineering Expense. Engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products, and costs related to enhancements of existing products and manufacturing processes. Engineering expenses increased $179,000 or 12.0% between periods, as they were $1,670,000 and $1,491,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Engineering expenses were consistent as a percentage of sales, being 3.4% for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Operating Profit. Reflecting all of the factors mentioned above, operating profits were up $925,000 or 9.5%, ending with a profit of $10,639,000 for the first half of 2017, compared to $9,714,000 in 2016. Interest Income. Interest income is recorded on cash investments, and when applicable, interest expense is recorded at times when the Company has debt amounts outstanding on its line of credit. There was $49,000 of interest income recorded during the first six months of 2017, and $40,000 during the same period in 2016. Other Income (Expense). Other income (expense) primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) on transactions with Omega Flex Limited, our UK subsidiary. During June of 2016, the British Pound weakened, largely as a result of the UK's vote to exit the European Union. As a result the Company recognized currency related losses of $178,000 for the six months ended June 30, 2016. The British Pound has stabilized in 2017, and during the first six months of 2017, the Company recognized a loss of only $22,000. Income Tax Expense. Income tax expense was $3,399,000 for the first six months of 2017, compared to $3,132,000 for the same period in 2016, increasing by $267,000, largely in correlation with the change in income before taxes. The Company's effective tax rate in 2017 approximates the 2016 rate and does not differ materially from expected statutory rates. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES Financial Reporting Release No. 60, released by the Securities and Exchange Commission, requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. The following is a brief discussion of the Company's more significant accounting policies. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition and related sales incentives, accounts receivable allowances, inventory valuations, goodwill valuation, product liability reserve, stock-based compensation valuations and accounting for income taxes. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. -25- Our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows: Revenue Recognition The Company's revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and pipe. Under GAAP, revenues are considered to have been earned when the Company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues. The following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue: ? Persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of product or services must exist. ? Delivery has occurred or services rendered. ? The sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable. ? Collection is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment in accordance with the above principles. Gross sales are reduced for all consideration paid to customers for which no identifiable benefit is received by the Company. This includes promotional incentives, which includes various programs including year-end rebates and discounts. The amounts of certain incentives are known with reasonable certainty at the time of sale, while others are projected based upon the most reliable information available at the reporting date. Commissions are accounted for as a sales expense. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include investments in an institutional money market fund, which invests in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds, and/or repurchase agreements, backed by such obligations. Carrying value approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited at various area banks, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company monitors the viability of the banking institutions carrying its assets on a regular basis, and has the ability to transfer cash to various institutions during times of risk. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these cash balances, and believes its credit risk to be minimal. Accounts Receivable and Provision for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. While management believes the allowance to be adequate, if the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. -26- The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on any known collection issues, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. The reserve for future credits, discounts, and doubtful accounts was $839,000 and $926,000 as of June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In regards to identifying uncollectible accounts, the Company reviews an aging report on a consistent basis to determine past due accounts, and utilizes a well established credit rating agency. The Company charges off those accounts that are deemed uncollectible once all collection efforts have been exhausted. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company generally considers inventory quantities beyond two-years usage, measured on a historical usage basis, to be excess inventory and reduces the carrying value of inventory accordingly. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, for leasehold improvements, the life of the lease, if shorter. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in other income or expense for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred; significant improvements are capitalized. Goodwill In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the Company performed an annual impairment test in accordance with this guidance as of December 31, 2016. This analysis did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. There were no circumstances that indicate that Goodwill might be impaired at June 30, 2017. Stock-Based Compensation Plans In 2006, the Company adopted a Phantom Stock Plan (the ""Plan""), which allows the Company to grant phantom stock units (Units) to certain key employees, officers or directors. The Units each represent a contractual right to payment of compensation in the future based upon the market value of the Company's common stock. The Units follow a vesting schedule of three years from the grant date, and are then paid upon maturity. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method for determining the fair value of the Units. Further details of the Plan are provided in Note 6. -27- Product Liability Reserves Product liability reserves represent the estimated unpaid amounts under the Company's insurance policies with respect to existing claims. The Company uses the most current available data to estimate claims. As explained more fully under Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies, for various product liability claims covered under the Company's general liability insurance policies, the Company must pay certain defense costs within its deductible or self-insured retention limits, ranging primarily from $25,000 to $1,000,000 per claim, depending on the terms of the policy in the applicable policy year, up to an aggregate amount. The Company is vigorously defending against all known claims. Fair Value of Financial and Nonfinancial Instruments The Company measures financial instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The accounting standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard creates a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company relies on its actively traded share value - a level 1 input - in determining the fair value of the reporting unit in its annual impairment test as described in the FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per share have been computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For the periods presented, there are no dilutive securities. Consequently, basic and dilutive earnings per share are the same. Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, most of which relate to our United Kingdom subsidiary whose functional currency is British pound sterling, are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet dates. The statements of income are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of financial statements are excluded from the determination of income and are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of income (other income (expense)) in the period in which they occur. -28- Income Taxes The Company accounts for tax liabilities in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under this method the Company records tax expense, related deferred taxes and tax benefits, and uncertainties in tax positions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize the benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain. The FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company's financial statements. This guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10 relative to accounting for uncertainties in tax positions. These provisions provide guidance on the recognition, de-recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions. The Company elected to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. For additional information regarding ASC 740-10, see Note 8 of the Company's December 31, 2016 Form 10-K. Other Comprehensive Income For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the components of other comprehensive income consisted solely of foreign currency translation adjustments. Significant Concentration The Company has one significant customer who represents more than 10% of the Company's Net Sales for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, and more than 10% of the Company's Accounts Receivable balance at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Geographically, the Company has a significant amount of sales in the United States versus internationally. These concentrations are discussed in detail in the Company's December 31, 2016 Form 10-K, and there has been no significant change as of this quarterly report. -29- Subsequent Events The Company evaluates all events or transactions through the date of the related filing that may have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 9 of the condensed consolidated financial statements.

OVERVIEW The Company is a leading manufacturer of flexible metal hose, and is currently engaged in a number of different markets, including construction, manufacturing, petrochemical transfer, pharmaceutical and other industries. The Company's business is managed as a single operating segment that consists of the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and accessories. The Company's products are concentrated in residential and commercial construction, and general industrial markets, with a comprehensive portfolio of intellectual property and patents issued in various countries around the world. The Company's primary product, flexible gas piping, is used for gas piping within residential and commercial buildings. Through its flexibility and ease of use, the Company's TracPipe(R) and TracPipe(R) CounterStrike(R) flexible gas piping, along with its fittings distributed under the trademarks AutoSnap(R) and AutoFlare(R), allows users to substantially cut the time required to install gas piping, as compared to traditional methods. The Company's products are manufactured at its Exton, Pennsylvania facilities in the United States, and in Banbury, Oxfordshire in the United Kingdom. A majority of the Company's sales across all industries are generated through independent outside sales organizations such as sales representatives, wholesalers and distributors, or a combination of both. The Company has a broad distribution network in North America and to a lesser extent in other global markets. -21- CHANGES IN FINANCIAL CONDITION For the period ended March 31, 2017 vs. December 31, 2016 The Company's cash balance of $23,987,000 at March 31, 2017, decreased $11,331,000 (32.1%) from the $35,318,000 balance at December 31, 2016. The Company paid a dividend of $8,578,000 during the first quarter of 2017 which was accrued at December 31, 2016, and also purchased a building in Exton, PA for approximately $2,500,000 in February 2017. Additionally, consistent with prior years, the Company paid a significant amount of cash during the first quarter for items that were accrued as of the end of the preceding year, such as sales incentive programs and incentive compensation. Those cash outflows were partially offset by income generated from operations during 2017. The Accounts Receivable balance was $16,725,000 at March 31, 2017, compared to $15,005,000 at December 31, 2016, increasing $1,720,000 (11.5%) during the quarter. The Company had its strongest sales month to date during March 2017, which elevated the level of Accounts Receivable as of March 31, 2017. Property and Equipment was $6,967,000 at March 31, 2017, compared to $4,402,000 at December 31, 2016, increasing $2,565,000 (58.3%). As noted above, the Company purchased a building in Exton, PA for approximately $2,500,000. This facility was previously leased. Accrued Compensation was $1,392,000 at March 31, 2017, compared to $4,319,000 at December 31, 2016, decreasing $2,927,000 (67.8%). A significant portion of the liability that existed at year end related to incentive compensation earned in 2016. As is customary, the liability was then paid during the first quarter of the following year, or 2017, thus diminishing the balance. The liability now represents amounts earned during the current year. Dividends Payable was $8,578,000 at the end of 2016, reflecting the $0.85 dividend declared by the Board in December 2016. This dividend was then paid to shareholders' in January of 2017, thus reducing the balance to zero. This also reduced the Company's cash balance, as described above. Taxes Payable increased $2,046,000, being $2,533,000 at March 31, 2017 versus $487,000 at December 31, 2016, mostly due to the build-up of tax liabilities during the first quarter of 2017 associated with profits. -22-  RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Three-months ended March 31, 2017 vs. March 31, 2016 The Company reported comparative results from continuing operations for the three-month periods ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 as follows: Three-months ended March 31, (in thousands) 2017 2017 2016 2016 ($000) % ($000) % Net Sales $ 25,607 100.0 % $ 20,626 100.0 % Gross Profit $ 15,336 59.9 % $ 12,492 60.6 % Operating Profit $ 6,204 24.2 % $ 4,021 19.5 %  Net Sales. The Company's 2017 first quarter sales of $25,607,000 were $4,981,000 or 24.1% higher than sales during the first quarter of 2016 of $20,626,000. Sales expanded in most areas of the business, as there was a resurgence of activity with some of the Company's largest volume customers that had slumped during the first quarter of the previous year. Gross Profit. The Company's gross profit margins were very similar from year to year, being 59.9% and 60.6% for the three-months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The Company did have to contend with higher pricing on some of its core raw material components, but was largely able to offset this by finding various manufacturing efficiencies. Selling Expenses. Selling expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and associated overhead costs, commissions, and the cost of marketing programs such as advertising, trade shows and related communication costs, and freight. Selling expense was $4,306,000 and $3,853,000 for the three-months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, representing an increase of $453,000, mostly attributable to variable items such as freight and commissions which rise with sales volume. Sales expense as a percent of net sales compared to last year, was 16.8% for the three-months ended March 31, 2017, and 18.7% for the three-months ended March 31, 2016. General and Administrative Expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries, benefits for administrative, executive and finance personnel, legal and accounting, and corporate general and administrative services. General and administrative expenses were $4,018,000 and $3,906,000 for the three-months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, thus increasing by $112,000. Incentive compensation was higher as a result of higher profits, and there was also an increase in insurance costs. Their impact was however softened by a decrease in legal and product liability related defense costs, which were high during the first quarter of 2016 due to a few specific matters which required a heightened defense. As a percentage of sales, general and administrative expenses decreased to 15.7% for the three months ended March 31, 2017 from 18.9% for the three months ended March 31, 2016. -23- Engineering Expense. Engineering expenses consist of development expenses associated with the development of new products and enhancements to existing products, and manufacturing engineering costs. Engineering expenses were $808,000 and $712,000 for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, increasing by $96,000. Engineering expenses decreased as a percentage of sales, being 3.2% for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and 3.5% for the same period in 2016. Operating Profits. Reflecting all of the factors mentioned above, Operating Profits were $2,183,000 or 54.3% above last year, being $6,204,000 and $4,021,000 for the quarters ending March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 respectively. Interest Income (Expense)-Net. Interest income is recorded on cash investments, and interest expense is recorded at times when the Company has debt amounts outstanding on its line of credit. The Company recorded a modest amount of interest income during the first quarters of both 2017 and 2016. Other Income (Expense)-Net. Other Income (Expense)-net primarily consists of foreign currency exchange gains (losses) on transactions with Omega Flex Limited, our UK subsidiary. There was expense of $40,000 and $46,000 recorded during the first quarters of 2017 and 2016, respectively. Income Tax Expense. Income Tax Expense was $2,005,000 for the first three months of 2017, compared to $1,308,000 for the same period in 2016. The $697,000 increase in the tax expense was largely the result of the increase in income before taxes. For the quarter, the Company's effective tax rate in 2017 approximates the 2016 rate and does not differ materially from expected statutory rates. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND USE OF ESTIMATES Financial Reporting Release No. 60, released by the Securities and Exchange Commission, requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements. Note 2 of the Notes to the Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements include a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements. The following is a discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies. The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the dates of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. The most significant estimates and assumptions relate to revenue recognition and related sales incentives, accounts receivable valuations, inventory valuations, goodwill valuation, product liability reserve, stock-based compensation valuations and accounting for income taxes. Actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates. -24- Our critical accounting policies and significant estimates and assumptions are described in more detail as follows: Revenue Recognition The Company's revenue recognition activities relate almost entirely to the manufacture and sale of flexible metal hose and pipe. Under GAAP, revenues are considered to have been earned when the Company has substantially accomplished what it must do to be entitled to the benefits represented by the revenues. The following criteria represent preconditions to the recognition of revenue: ? Persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale of product or services must exist. ? Delivery has occurred or services rendered. ? The sales price to the customer is fixed or determinable. ? Collection is reasonably assured. The Company recognizes revenue upon shipment in accordance with the above principles. Gross sales are reduced for all consideration paid to customers for which no identifiable benefit is received by the Company. This includes promotional incentives, which includes various programs including year-end rebates, and payment term discounts. The amounts of certain incentives are known with reasonable certainty at the time of sale, while others are projected based upon the most reliable information available at the reporting date. Commissions are accounted for as a selling expense. Cash Equivalents The Company considers all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of 90 days or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents. Cash equivalents include investments in an institutional money market fund, which invests in U.S. Treasury bills, notes and bonds, and/or repurchase agreements, backed by such obligations. Carrying value approximates fair value. Cash and cash equivalents are deposited at various area banks, which at times may exceed federally insured limits. The Company monitors the viability of the banking institutions carrying its assets on a regular basis, and has the ability to transfer cash to various institutions during times of risk. The Company has not experienced any losses related to these cash balances, and believes its credit risk to be minimal. Accounts Receivable and Provision for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future. The estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and historical write-off experience. While management believes the allowance to be adequate, if the financial condition of the Company's customers were to deteriorate, resulting in their inability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. -25- The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. The Company determines the allowance based on any known collection issues, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. The reserve for future credits, discounts, and doubtful accounts was $936,000 and $926,000 as of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively. In regards to identifying uncollectible accounts, the Company reviews an aging report on a consistent basis to determine past due accounts, and utilizes a well-established credit rating agency. The Company charges off those accounts that are deemed uncollectible once all collection efforts have been exhausted. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The cost of inventories is determined by the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. The Company generally considers inventory quantities beyond two-years usage, measured on a historical usage basis, to be excess inventory and reduces the carrying value of inventory accordingly. Property and Equipment Property and equipment are carried at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets or, for leasehold improvements, the life of the lease, if shorter. When assets are retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in other income or expense for the period. The cost of maintenance and repairs is expensed as incurred; significant improvements are capitalized. Goodwill In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, the Company performed an annual impairment test in accordance with this guidance as of December 31, 2016. This analyses did not indicate any impairment of goodwill. There were no circumstances that indicate that goodwill might be impaired at March 31, 2017. Stock-Based Compensation Plans In 2006, the Company adopted a Phantom Stock Plan (the ""Plan""), which allows the Company to grant phantom stock units (""Units"") to certain key employees, officers or directors. The Units each represent a contractual right to payment of compensation in the future based upon the market value of the Company's common stock. The Units follow a vesting schedule of three years from the grant date, and are then paid upon maturity. In accordance with FASB ASC Topic 718, Stock Compensation, the Company uses the Black-Scholes option pricing model as its method for determining the fair value of the Units. Further details of the Plan are provided in Note 6. -26- Product Liability Reserves Product liability reserves represent the estimated unpaid amounts under the Company's insurance policies with respect to existing claims. The Company uses the most current available data to estimate claims. As explained more fully under Note 5, Commitments and Contingencies, for various product liability claims covered under the Company's general liability insurance policies, the Company must pay certain defense and settlement costs within its deductible or self-insured retention limits, ranging primarily from $25,000 to $1,000,000 per claim, depending on the terms of the policy in the applicable policy year, up to an aggregate amount. The Company is vigorously defending against all known claims. Fair Value of Financial and Nonfinancial Instruments The Company measures financial instruments in accordance with FASB ASC Topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. The accounting standard defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value under GAAP, and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements. Fair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Valuation techniques used to measure fair value must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. The standard creates a fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels as follows: Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs that reflect the Company's own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The Company relies on its actively traded share value - a Level 1 input - in determining the fair value of the reporting unit in its annual impairment test as described in the FASB ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. Earnings per Common Share Basic earnings per share have been computed using the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. For the periods presented, there are no dilutive securities. Consequently, basic and dilutive earnings per share are the same. Currency Translation Assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, most of which relate to our United Kingdom subsidiary whose functional currency is British pound sterling, are translated into U.S. dollars at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet dates. The statements of income are translated into U.S. dollars at average exchange rates for the period. Adjustments resulting from the translation of financial statements are excluded from the determination of income and are accumulated in a separate component of shareholders' equity. Exchange gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in the statements of income (other expense) in the period in which they occur. -27- Income Taxes The Company accounts for tax liabilities in accordance with the FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes. Under this method the Company records tax expense, related deferred taxes and tax benefits, and uncertainties in tax positions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities from a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. A valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the Company is able to realize the benefit, or that future deductibility is uncertain. The FASB ASC Topic 740, Income Taxes, clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a company's financial statements. This guidance prescribes a recognition threshold of more-likely than-not, and a measurement attribute for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the financial statements. The Company follows the provisions of ASC 740-10 relative to accounting for uncertainties in tax positions. These provisions provide guidance on the recognition, de-recognition and measurement of potential tax benefits associated with tax positions. The Company elected to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of the income tax provision in the consolidated statements of income. For additional information regarding ASC 740-10, see Note 8 of the Company's December 31, 2016 Form 10-K. Other Comprehensive Income For the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, the components of other comprehensive income consisted solely of foreign currency translation adjustments. Significant Concentration At March 31, 2017, the Company has one significant customer who represented more than 10% of the Company's Accounts Receivable and more than 10% of the Company's total Net Sales for the quarter ending March 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, that same customer represented more than 10% of the Company's Accounts Receivable balance. However, no customer represented more than 10% of Net Sales for the first quarter of 2016. Geographically, the Company has a significant amount of sales in the United States versus internationally. These concentrations are discussed in detail in the Company's December 31, 2016 Form 10-K. -28- Subsequent Events The Company evaluates all events or transactions through the date of the related filing that may have a material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements. Refer to Note 9 of the condensed consolidated financial statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606), requiring an entity to recognize the amount of revenue to which it expects to be entitled for the transfer of promised goods or services to customers. The updated standard will replace most existing revenue recognition guidance in U.S. GAAP when it becomes effective and permits the use of either a full retrospective or retrospective with cumulative effect transition method. The updated standard becomes effective for the Company in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018. Early adoption is permitted beginning in the first quarter of the Company's 2017 fiscal year. The Company has reviewed the respective guidance and currently does not anticipate that the updated standard will have a significant impact on the way the Company currently records revenue, if any, or on the consolidated financial statements as a whole. In July 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-11, Simplifying the Measurement of Inventory (Topic 330). Under this ASU, inventory will be measured at the ""lower of cost and net realizable value"" and options that currently exist for ""market value"" will be eliminated. The ASU defines net realizable value as the ""estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business, less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal, and transportation."" No other changes were made to the current guidance on inventory measurement. ASU 2015-11 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Early application was permitted and should be applied prospectively. The Company has evaluated the provisions of this statement, and concluded that the adoption of ASU 2015-11 did not have a material impact on the Company's financial position or results of operations. In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). Under this ASU, lessees are required to recognize right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for all leases not considered short-term leases. By definition, a short-term lease is one in which: (a) the lease term is 12 months or less and (b) there is not an option to purchase the underlying asset that the lessee is reasonably certain to exercise. For short-term leases, lessees may elect an accounting policy by class of underlying asset under which right-of-use assets and lease liabilities are not recognized and lease payments are generally recognized as expense over the lease term on a straight-line basis. This change will result in lessees recognizing right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for most leases currently accounted for as operating leases under the legacy lease accounting guidance. ASU 2016-02 is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018. Early adoption is permitted. The Company is evaluating the provisions of this statement, including which period to adopt, and has not determined what impact the adoption of ASU 2016-02 will have on the Company's financial position or results of operations. -29- LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Historically, the Company's primary cash needs have been related to working capital items, which the Company has largely funded through cash generated from operations. As of March 31, 2017, the Company had a cash balance of $23,987,000. Additionally, the Company has a $15,000,000 line of credit available, as discussed in detail in Note 4, which had no borrowings outstanding upon it at March 31, 2017. At December 31, 2016, the Company had a cash balance of $35,318,000, with no borrowings against the line of credit. Operating Activities Cash provided by (used in) operating activities is net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in certain assets and liabilities, such as those included in working capital. For the first three months of 2017, the Company's operating activities used cash of $176,000, compared to the first quarter of 2016 which provided cash of $2,059,000, thus decreasing cash by $2,235,000. The most significant factor related to accounts receivable, and the respective timing of cash collection. While sales were extremely strong during the current quarter, a good portion of the cash related to those sales was still captured in accounts receivable, with clearance pending standard collection terms. In contrast, the first quarter of 2016 showed a large collection of cash that funneled through mostly from sales generated during the fourth quarter of 2015. Also, during 2017 the Company used cash to purchase inventory, while the Company actually saw a reduction of inventory purchases during the first quarter of the previous year. Investing Activities Cash used in investing activities for the first three months of 2017 and 2016 was $2,675,000 and $33,000, respectively, reflecting a $2,642,000 increase in . . .

OFLX,"EXTON, Pa., May 15, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- In a recent press release, the Lightning Protection Institute cautioned its member contractors to take liability precautions when installing lightning protections systems in homes with corrugated stainless steel tubing. LPI stated that “the efficacy of [CSST] bonding practices hasn’t been verified.” However, that statement by LPI contradicts its prior statements and one of the basic principles of lightning protection – bonding of metallic systems to the electrical ground will mitigate arcing and attendant damage. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20170515005826/en/ In August of 2008, the Lightning Protection Institute issued an LPI Tech Letter on the new changes to the National Fuel Gas Code (NFPA 54). The 2009 version of NFPA 54 required that if a “lightning protection system is installed for a structure, metallic gas piping shall be bonded to the lightning protection grounding system.” At the time, LPI noted with approval that this change and other changes in NFPA standard “clarify language with regard to lightning protections systems, which has helped to highlight the importance of equipotential bonding . . .” Furthermore, LPI’s recent press release ignores a key principle of lightning protection, which is the equipotential bonding of metal systems inside a building to side flashes. That principle is evidenced in the lightning protection code, “Standard for the Installation of Lightning Protection Systems.” [1] Sections 4.14 and 4.16 of that code specifically require that metal systems, including gas piping, must be bonded to the lightning protection system. LPI also ignores recent work performed by the corrugated stainless steel tubing (CSST) industry working with the Fire Protection Research Foundation and Gas Technology Institute (GTI). GTI and its vendors conducted independent experiments at a leading lightning laboratory to conclusively prove that bonding of gas piping systems, including CSST systems, would suppress transient arcing caused by a near-by lightning strike. The GTI study concluded that the “connection of a 6AWG copper direct bonding conductor between the CSST and earth ground diverts sufficient energy to prevent perforation over a wide range of conditions.” [2] Finally, in the recent LPI press release, there is a statement that calls for statistical information about lightning fires involving CSST. That statement also ignores the current existing information published by the NFPA [3] that clearly shows that the number of lightning fires to residential homes in the United States is about 1% of the total of all residential fires, and that fires caused by lightning in which natural gas or propane are the materials first ignited are about 0.06% of all residential fires. It should be noted that those lightning/gas fires also include rigid pipe systems as well as CSST systems. It is clear from existing data that the threat of lightning damage to a CSST system and fires, while a serious issue, is not a significant major fire threat in the United States (see chart above regarding the leading causes of US home structure fires). The CSST industry has not waited for regulatory mandates, but has taken the initiative to develop a new generation of conductive-jacket CSST products that provide an additional measure of safety against damage from electrical arcing caused by lightning. These products have been proven to be able to withstand damage from electrical arcing caused by lightning by an order of magnitude compared to the original CSST designs. We invite you to learn more by going to our website www.tracpipe.com to learn more about our lightning resistant CSST, CounterStrike [®] - the best CSST on the market today. About CSST CSST was initially developed during the early 1980s as a safe and effective gas distribution system that can withstand damage that can occur during earthquakes and other natural disasters. The comprehensive CSST system consists of flexible pipe between the building gas source and appliances. The flexibility of the tube allows it to be routed throughout the building in continuous lengths without the many joints required with rigid piping, and without the need for any special tools. Corrugated stainless steel tubing now commands slightly over one-half of the market for fuel gas piping in new and remodeled residential construction in the United States, and the use of rigid iron pipe, and to a lesser degree copper tube, accounts for the remainder of the market. For more information about CSST, visit www.tracpipe.com. About TracPipe CounterStrike TracPipe CounterStrike is designed to be more resistant to damage from transient electrical arcing than conventional gas piping materials. In a lightning strike, the electrical energy of the lightning can energize all electrical and mechanical components in a building. This electrical energy in attempting to reach ground may arc between systems that have different electrical potential, and arcing can cause damage to any of these systems. TracPipe CounterStrike CSST is designed with an electrically conductive jacket to dissipate this energy, protecting the gas carrying stainless steel core. In 2007, TracPipe CounterStrike was tested to be six times more resistant to damage from electrical arcing than the original TracPipe CounterStrike version, and between 50 to 400 times more effective than traditional competitive CSST products. About OmegaFlex Established in 1975, Omega Flex, Inc. OFLX, -0.17% is the pre-eminent international producer of flexible metallic piping products.

OFLX,"PHILADELPHIA, Apr 25, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- As reported both nationally and in The Legal Intelligencer, the Pennsylvania Superior Court has affirmed a record-setting $55 million jury verdict against Honda Motor Company from a product liability lawsuit involving a seat belt defect. The plaintiff in the case, Carlos Martinez, is represented by Eisenberg, Rothweiler, Winkler, Eisenberg & Jeck attorneys Stewart Eisenberg and Daniel J. Sherry, Jr. Following the trial court verdict, Honda appealed to the Pennsylvania Superior Court and contended there should be a new trial for multiple reasons. Honda claimed that the trial court should have allowed Honda to present evidence that the 1999 Acura Integra complied with industry and federal standards. However, the Superior Court rejected that argument, agreeing with the trial court that the evidence was inadmissible. The Superior Court also determined that the trial court properly charged the jury in light of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s ruling in Tincher v. Omega Flex. Furthermore, the Superior Court rejected Honda's contention that the jury was improperly instructed on the correct legal standards pertaining to warnings, and refused Honda's request to reduce the amount of the jury's verdict. Stewart and Daniel secured the $55 million jury verdict for Mr. and Mrs. Martinez against Honda after a Philadelphia jury determined that the seatbelt installed in the 1999 Acura Integra was defectively designed and caused Mr. Martinez to strike his head on the vehicle's roof during a low-speed rollover. This caused Mr. Martinez, a beloved husband, father, and wage-earner, to become a motorized wheelchair dependent quadriplegic who is now forced to rely on others for all activities of daily living. The jury also determined that Honda failed to adequately warn Mr. Martinez of the dangers associated with the seatbelt, given that Honda knew, since 1992, that that seatbelt would not protect occupants of the Integra in the event of a rollover.  When asked for his thoughts on the case, Stewart Eisenberg said, ""On behalf of our clients, we are pleased with the unanimous decision by the Superior Court affirming the verdict that was handed down by the jury in Philadelphia almost 3 years ago.""
