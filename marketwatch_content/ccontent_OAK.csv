OAK,"The bruising fight between the two largest shareholders at Tronc Inc. is starting to take a toll on the bottom line for the publisher of the Los Angeles Times and Chicago Tribune. The newspaper group said Wednesday that a large private share buyback from an outside investor in March that bolstered the position of Tronc's largest shareholder and nonexecutive chairman, Michael Ferro, resulted in a $3 million net loss for the firm in the first quarter. ""It was a unique, private transaction which we had reviewed with the board which the board had authorized,"" Tronc Chief Financial Officer Terry Jimenez said in an earnings call with analysts. The deal to buy 3.75 million shares from Oaktree Capital at an above-market price of $15 each, for a total of about $56 million, led to a one-time $6 million charge. Without it, the company would have reported a $3 million net profit in what was overall a tough quarter, Mr. Jimenez said. Tronc's expenses fell $49 million while it recorded an 8.1% decline in total revenue to $366 million. Advertising revenue fell 13.1% across its 11 newspapers. The Oaktree buyback came just days after a simmering struggle between Mr. Ferro and the company's second-largest shareholder, Dr. Patrick Soon-Shiong, erupted into open warfare. Mr. Ferro had convinced Dr. Soon-Shiong to acquire 12.9% of the company a year ago as a critical block against a takeover effort by Gannett Co. As time passed, Dr. Soon-Shiong, who became vice chairman, and Mr. Ferro started to spar over the direction of the company and both began to slowly increase their ownership stake to just under a 25% limit tied to their investment agreements. The situation came to a head in March, when the board dropped Dr. Soon-Shiong from a slate of directors shareholders voted on in April and approved raising the ownership cap for Mr. Ferro to 30%. Buying out Oaktree removed a thorn in Mr. Ferro's side and appeared designed to forestall Dr. Soon-Shiong from joining forces with Oaktree, which had previously sparred with Tronc's board. Oaktree signed a ""standstill"" agreement as part of the buyback that prevents it from buying shares or taking action against Tronc for two years. Oaktree had wanted Tronc to sell to Gannett last year and has publicly complained that the board was destroying shareholder value. Write to Lukas I.

OAK,"Permian Resources LLC, an oil producer with ties to late wildcatter Aubrey McClendon, reached a debt-restructuring deal with a key creditor meant to relieve its heavy debt burden. The Oklahoma City company late Monday announced a deal under which energy-focused private-equity firm OnyxPoint Global Management LP will forgive more than $300 million in debt in exchange for a stake in the company. OnyxPoint and other investors, including Permian Resources owner Energy & Minerals Group, or EMG, also will provide more than $700 million in new equity capital that will be used to pay down debt and fund operations. The deal puts OnyxPoint in control of Permian Resources alongside EMG, which is contributing to the equity funding. The company will be renamed Sable Permian Resources LLC. OnyxPoint is a new firm led by Shaia Hosseinzadeh, the former head of energy investing at WL Ross & Co. WL Ross's founder, distressed investor Wilbur Ross, recently resigned from the firm to join President Donald Trump's administration as Commerce secretary. The deal was first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Permian Resources is one of several energy producers Mr. McClendon helped form several years ago with financial backing from EMG. The ventures marked Mr. McClendon's return to the business after he was ousted from Chesapeake Energy Corp. He died in a car wreck in March 2016. Permian Resources, which has some $3 billion in debt, ran into trouble after oil and gas prices tumbled more than two years ago. Some 119 oil-and-gas companies have filed for bankruptcy protection in the U.S. and Canada since 2014, according to the law firm Haynes & Boone LLP. The industry's crisis has abated since prices rose from last year's lows, but some energy companies remain unprofitable and overly indebted. The downturn attracted hedge funds and private-equity firms that invest in downtrodden assets. In recent years, Apollo Global Management LLC, WL Ross, Oaktree Capital Group LLC and other distressed investors have snapped up Permian Resources' discounted debt, angling to take ownership of the company in a bankruptcy or out-of-court restructuring. The Permian Resources restructuring isn't expected to affect the legal wrangling among creditors of Mr. McClendon's estate. EMG and OnyxPoint will name directors to Permian Resources' board, and they have tapped former Plains Exploration & Production Co. Chief Executive James Flores to lead the company. Mr. Flores was CEO of Plains Exploration during its $6.3 billion tie-up with mining giant Freeport-McMoRan Inc. in 2013.

OAK,"Credit markets—and other financial assets—are undoubtedly expensive, but don’t call it a bubble, well-known value investor Howard Marks said in a Friday television interview. Marks, whose Oaktree Capital Group OAK, -0.59%  manages around $100 billion primarily invested in distressed and corporate debt, told Bloomberg Television that while the credit market is clearly “rich,” rather than “fair” or “cheap,” a lack of euphoria is a sign that it isn’t in bubble territory. “I think we’re not in a bubble because I think one of the characteristics of a bubble is having people say, ‘no matter what price you pay you’ll make money,’” the billionaire investor said. “We saw that in the tech bubble. We saw that in the Nifty 50 bubble 50 years ago.” The Nifty 50 refers to 50 large-cap growth stocks, like McDonald’s Corp. MCD, +2.23% and International Business Machines Corp. IBM, -0.93% which were extremely popular buy-and-hold investments in the late 1960s and early 1970s. pushing their price-to-earnings ratios into the stratosphere until a market collapse upended Wall Street in 1973-’74. Bloomberg News/Landov Howard Marks, co-chairman of Oaktree Capital Management LP See: Here’s why corporate bond investors want more Trump tax plan details Instead, investors are fretting about how expensive things are, which is a good sign because it implies a sense of “awareness” about elevated price levels among market participants, said the Oaktree co-chairman. Marks acknowledged that it is indeed a tough market for investors, who he said have to reconcile themselves to a low-return world. For credit investors, that means looking to buy better-quality credits “in the hope that you can get them at a decent yield,” he said.

OAK,"When President Donald Trump’s pick for chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission shows up for his confirmation hearing Thursday, Jay Clayton will likely enjoy lavish praise from Republicans for being a “job creator” but harsh criticism from Democrats about his conflicts. Trump communicated his goals for the agency to Clayton when he announced the nomination on Jan.4. Clayton, said Trump, “will ensure our financial institutions can thrive and create jobs while playing by the rules at the same time.” See also: Trump’s SEC may take aim at corporate disclosure How did Trump expect Clayton’s SEC to do that? “We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers.” Clayton’s acceptance of his nomination was a bit more nuanced but he is on message with regard to jobs. “If confirmed,” said Clayton, “we are going to work together with key stakeholders in the financial system to make sure we provide investors and our companies with the confidence to invest together in America. We will carefully monitor our financial sector, as we set policy that encourages American companies to do what they do best: create jobs.” See also: Trump’s SEC pick pushed clients to say more about climate-change risks There are three key components to the SEC’s mission— protect investors, maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets, and facilitate capital formation. Depending on the politics at the time, the parties focus on one or another as a priority. Republicans will focus on Clayton’s capital formation record as an attorney who worked with famous clients on mergers and acquisitions. Democrats are expected to focus on his lack of a record on either investor protection and enforcement. Both sides will have to address Clayton’s extensive potential conflicts of interest that may require even more recusals from cases than Mary Jo White, the previous head of the agency. White had to sit out on several issues either because of her own work at law firm Debevoise or the work of her husband, a partner at law firm Cravath who specializes in cases related to audit failure and accounting fraud. After his first meeting with Clayton, Sen. Mike Crapo, the Idaho Republican and majority leader on the Senate Banking Committee, the committee holding the hearing before a full Senate vote, praised Clayton as an impressive candidate for SEC chairman. “We had a positive discussion about the role of the SEC in facilitating capital formation and reducing unnecessary burdens for small regulated entities,” said Crapo. Mike Hermsen, a former SEC attorney now with law firm Mayer Brown, said repealing SEC Dodd-Frank rules may not lead directly to job creation. “Will companies really use the savings from the conflict-minerals disclosure rule repeal to hire more workers? Will investors see more oversight of the financial system and protection for workers after SEC scraps compensation rules like pay equity and bonus rules for financial services executives? I don’t see the direct line from one to the other.” Clayton’s long list of corporate clients worries Sen. Sherrod Brown, the minority leader for Senate Banking. Brown’s spokesman told MarketWatch that the senator had a “cordial” meeting with the nominee in January. However, when the nomination was announced, Brown’s statement was less sanguine. “It’s hard to see,” said Brown, “how an attorney who’s spent his career helping Wall Street beat the rap will keep President-elect Trump’s promise to stop big banks and hedge funds from ‘getting away with murder.’” Brown is referring to Clayton’s lengthy list of corporate clients as a partner in law firm Sullivan & Cromwell’s mergers and acquisitions practice. Media reports portray him as a stealth deal-maker during the financial crisis, advising J.P. Morgan Chase JPM, -1.00%   in its bargain grab of Bear Stearns and Barclays BCS, -0.21%    in a successful bid for Lehman Brothers’ broker-dealer. Clayton also advised GM’s former mortgage arm, Ally Financial ALLY, -1.95%   , Oaktree Capital OAK, -0.88%   , Och-Ziff OZM, -0.19%   and Alibaba BABA, -2.20%   on their respective initial public offerings.

Under the terms of the Oaktree-backed plan, Quiksilver’s $279 million in secured bond debt will be swapped for a majority of the stock of the reorganized retailer. The proposed plan, which requires court approval, has the backing of 73% of the company’s senior most class of debt, Quiksilver said in court papers.

OAK,"We might not be looking at such big gains this morning were it not for the manic-depressive Athens situation, which is in full mania mode this morning. Gains for global markets on Monday — driven by the potential for a deal that could kick Greece-euro-exit threats down the road — come at the start of a traditionally bearish week for equities. It’s the week after June options expiration, a trading period that’s been marked by losses in 11 of the past 12 years, notes Urban Carmel, blogging for The Fat Pitch. The good news is that July, at least the first part, can be great for stocks. And oddly enough, a little Greek drama wouldn’t hurt that pattern at all, says Carmel. Read our chart(s) of the day for more on this subject. Plenty are talking about what happens if a Greek deal isn’t reached today, with capital controls almost a foregone conclusion, given heavy recent withdrawals out of Greek banks. See our stat of the day for more on that. The Sober Look blog laid out what a cash economy in Greece would look like. Analysts at J.P. Morgan Cazenove said now is the time to get back into the German DAX DAX, +1.31% which is down nearly 5% this quarter and cheap versus the rest of Europe. Its strategist Mislav Matejka is also steadfast that there will be no Greece exit from the eurozone. At some point, markets are going to move past Greece. It may be hard to keep focus today, but here’s some perspective on the situation, compliments of StockTwits trader Sean McLaughlin: Our call of the day looks at U.S. dividend darlings — which ones to hold and which ones to fold as rates go up. Key market gauges A Greece-relief rally is underway. Futures on the Dow US:YMM5  and the S&P US:ESM5  are soaring, while the Europe Stoxx 600 SXXP, +0.44%  is up 3% and Greece’s ASE Composite index GD, -1.30%  is rocketing 7% higher. The dollar DXY, -0.10%  is holding steady. The feel-good vibes spread across Asia stocks ADOW, +0.24% though the Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -0.18%  was closed for a holiday after falling into correction territory last week. Crude CLN5, +0.00%  is up, and gold US:GCN5  is pulling back further under $1,200 an ounce. The quote Well, look what the Twittercat dragged in this weekend: Oh, DSK’s legal woes might not be over yet. The stat J.P. Morgan analysts estimate that €6 billion euros ($6.8 billion) was yanked by depositors from Greek banks in the week ended June 9. Since the beginning of the year, €44 billion has been withdrawn, and €117 billion since the end of 2009. H/t Bloomberg News.

Meanwhile, Amazon AMZN, -4.50%  will start using a machine-learning platform to hunt down fake reviews. The call Using some quantitative analysis, which basically uses math and statistical modeling, Morgan Stanley has come up with a short list of high-dividend stocks that offer the best risk-adjusted returns for investors looking for yield. The favorites are alternative-asset managers, natural gas and master limited partnerships, in which investors buy units of the partnership rather than shares of stock. Least attractive are telecom and tobacco shares. Here’s one great explanation of how interest rates can affect some dividend-paying stocks. Strategist Adam Parker and his team say the asset classes they like have shown little sensitivity to interest-rate changes, based on tests of sensitivity to moves in the yield curve since June 2012. Here are a few of the names they like: Health Care REIT US:HCN US:HCN Liberty Property Group LPT, -1.76% Dominion Resources D, +0.16% Williams Cos.

The chart Stocks hit slightly overbought territory last week, so investors may be looking to build on that strength, says Urban Carmel at Fat Pitch. However, we are in a week that’s dicey, as far as history goes. Every year since 1998, post June-options expiration has sucker-punched this market, he notes. But as July tends to be “bullish standout,” for markets, that June gloom can be overcome, says the blogger. He points out this chart from Bespoke, showing higher prices over the past 20, 50 and 100 years in July, as evidence: Bespoke Investment Group And this one from Sentimentrader: Sentimentrader And the best setup for the next month? If stocks “retreat from their slightly overbought levels this week, allowing sentiment to become less bullish. Drama from Greece would be a welcome catalyst,” says Carmel. So bring on that chaos.

OAK,"Oaktree Capital Group posted first-quarter net income of $38.3 million, down from $51.8 million a year earlier, partly because of lower incentive income. The Los Angeles private equity firm, which specializes in credit investments, said lower incentive income--the firm's cut of profits from the funds it manages--also was to blame for its lower adjusted net income, which fell to $155.3 million from $246.9 million a year earlier. Adjusted net income is a performance metric used by some alternative asset managers that isn't compliant with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. The lower incentive income was largely a result of annual tax-related incentive distributions, Oaktree said. Oaktree said its first-quarter economic net income--a profitability measure that includes unrealized gains as well as cash earnings--edged higher to $228.9 million from $227.2 million a year earlier. Assets under management were up 16% to $99.9 billion from $86.23 billion a year earlier. Oaktree, a New York Stock Exchange-listed firm best known for making distressed investments, hasn't found the most ideal environment over the past few years, as low interest rates and an abundance of credit helped to keep corporate default rates near record lows. Oaktree historically has structured its core funds to accommodate the ebbs and flows of distressed opportunities. Consisting of two vehicles, the core funds can invest one vehicle or both at a time, depending on the amount of distressed assets available for purchase. The firm aims to wrap up its latest core fund, Oaktree Opportunities Fund X LP, and a companion vehicle around May 12. Total commitments to the two vehicles could be more than $10 billion. During a conference call Thursday to discuss Oaktree's first-quarter results, Co-Chairman and Chief Investment Officer Bruce Karsh said the firm is seeing attractive opportunities in Europe compared with the U.S., as well as in sectors such as shipping. Chief Executive Jay Wintrob during the call said Oaktree is looking selectively at new initiatives, such as expanding its infrastructure investment, with plans to raise the firm's first infrastructure fund. He added the firm has been studying new real estate strategies. ""We are watching that very closely,"" said Mr. Wintrob, without elaborating.

OAK,"SYDNEY--A battle between two U.S.-led consortiums for control of Billabong International Ltd. (BBG.AU) took a new twist Thursday when the Australian surfwear company tore up an existing refinancing deal and overhauled its top management. Billabong said it has accepted a new funding package from Centerbridge Partners LP and Oaktree Capital Management, backing away from a rival rescue deal after the distressed debt investors sweetened their original bid. The struggling company, which recently reported a 860 million Australian dollars (US$816 million) annual loss, had agreed to accept a refinancing proposal from private equity firm Altamont Capital Partners and Blackstone Group's BX, -1.67% credit arm, GSO Capital Partners. The new agreement involves Billabong using funding provided by Centerbridge and Oaktree to repay the US$294 million loan it received from the Altamont consortium. It also involves issuing new shares and options to Centerbridge and Oaktree that will result in the pair owning up to 40.8% of Billabong's stock. As part of the deal, Neil Fiske, a former head of adventure-wear company Eddie Bauer Holdings Inc., will become Billabong's new chief executive. Mr. Bauer displaces the Altamont consortium's choice, former Oakley Inc. boss Scott Olivet. Centerbridge and Oaktree's bid was ""significantly improved"" compared to an earlier offer, partly because it involves cheaper funding costs. Existing Billabong shareholders will also be able to buy A$50 million worth of new Billabong shares at 28 cents each. Centerbridge and Oaktree would have ended up with a greater equity stake in company of up to 44.3% under the previous deal.

OAK,"Australian free-to-air television broadcaster Nine Entertainment Co. wants to raise up to 1.2 billion Australian dollars (US$1.09 billion) in an initial public offering before the end of the year, The Australian newspaper reported Wednesday. Citing unnamed sources, the report said the company hopes to raise between A$800 million and A$1.2 billion and list on the Australian Securities Exchange in November or December. Nine was saved from the brink of insolvency by senior debt holders including U.S. hedge funds Oaktree Capital Group LLC OAK, -0.38% and Apollo Global Management LLC APO, -0.65% in October. The debt-for-equity swap rescue deal gave the two U.S. companies 95.5% of Nine's equity. The listing could involve them selling down as much as half their stakes, the report said.

OAK,"Oaktree Capital Group LLC's OAK, -0.51% first-quarter profit surged as the investment management firm reported sharply stronger incentive income, outweighing a drop in management fee revenue. Los Angeles-based Oaktree's specialty is in debt investing, with more than half of its assets in distressed and corporate debt. The firm managed roughly $78.8 billion in assets as of March 31, up 1.2% from a year earlier. ""The first quarter's records for adjusted net income, distributable earnings and the unitholder distribution reflect the strong cash generating capacity of our business,"" Chairman Howard Marks said. ""Plus, the substantial incentives created by the quarter's strong fund returns bode well for our future cash flow."" Overall, the company reported a profit of $57.6 million, or $1.91 a Class A unit, versus a year-earlier profit of $18.6 million, or 82 cents a Class A unit. Adjusted per-unit earnings rose to $1.95 from 90 cents. Revenue jumped 86% to $593.4 million as incentive income surged to $327.2 million from $62.7 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters recently expected per-unit earnings of $1.52 on revenue of $518 million. Management fees decreased 3.7%, to $184.2 million, reflecting a decrease in fees attributable to closed-end funds in liquidation. Economic net income climbed 43% from a year earlier to $2.07 a Class A unit. Asset managers like Oaktree consider economic net income to be a better barometer of performance because it includes the impact of employee compensation and other items. Distributable earnings, or cash flow to investors, were $1.79 a Class A unit from 67 cents the year before. Expenses rose 64% to $275.5 million, driven by a sharp rise in incentive income compensation. Units closed Monday at $54.26 and were inactive in recent premarket trading. The stock has risen 31% in the past 12 months.

OAK,"Some of the most valuable information from hedge funds and other notable investors comes in the form of the small-cap and mid-cap stocks they own. These companies often receive less attention from the media and the investment community, so in theory it should be more likely for them to be mispriced relative to their fundamental value. As it turns out, the most popular small cap picks among hedge funds earn an alpha of 120 basis points per month on average. We expanded on this finding in our August newsletter by listing the most popular stocks in this market cap category and those picks proceeded to return 14% between September and December (read more about our hedge fund small cap strategy). Of course, blindly following investors isn't necessarily as smart as using their stock picks as free ideas (similar to the results of an investment screen), taking a brief look at the company, and then deciding whether or not it should be researched further. We looked at billionaire Howard Marks' Oaktree Capital Management's most recent 13F filing (see the full list of Oaktree's stock picks) and found three stocks with market caps between $1 billion and $5 billion that it owned at the time. Oaktree is publicly traded as Oaktree Capital Group OAK, -0.51% EXCO Resources US:XCO an oil and gas exploration and production company focused on U.S. shale plays, was one of Oaktree's top picks with a position of 37 million shares. EXCO is not profitable on a trailing basis, and many market players do not like its current valuation seeing as 16% of the outstanding shares are held short. Analyst expectations imply a current-year P/E of 20. Wilbur Ross's Invesco Private Capital had the stock as one of its top holdings at the end of the quarter as well, reporting ownership of 32 million shares (find Invesco's favorite stocks). We can compare EXCO to Chesapeake CHK, -6.13% which had a very stressful 2012 (and is also a short target) but where analysts are slightly more optimistic: the natural gas producer trades at 16 times consensus earnings for this year. Marks and his team also liked Omnicare US:OCR a $4.3 billion market cap provider of pharmacy services primarily to assisted living facilities and other communities. Oaktree had about 680,000 shares of the stock in its portfolio at the end of the quarter according to the 13F. Omnicare is another popular short, with short sellers responsible for 15% of the float. Earnings have been up, though considerable future growth is already priced in to the stock given the trailing P/E of 27. Analyst expectations imply a current-year P/E of 11 and a five-year PEG ratio of 1. Two hedge funds with large positions in the stock at the end of September were Iridian Asset Management and First Pacific Advisors. Iridian, which is managed by David Cohen and Harold Levy, owned 7.7 million shares (see more of Iridian's stock picks) while First Pacific owned 6.5 million shares. We like the company's business but we are certainly taking note of the premium valuation. Vishay VSH, -3.12% was another small cap that Oaktree owned, reporting a position of 2.8 million shares. Vishay is a $1.6 billion market cap semiconductor company whose stock has slumped 11% in the last year. In the third quarter of 2012, revenue was down 10% from a year earlier and with margins contracting net income dropped 56%. However, the earnings multiples are in the low teens and due to a large cash position the EV/Ebitda multiple is a low 2.9x. As a result while the company may not be good quality the stock may be cheap enough to make it worth considering. Chuck Royce's Royce & Associates was another major holder of the stock (check out Royce's stock picks). Click here to learn more about the Insider Monkey's Hedge Fund Newsletter.

OAK,"(Updates with comment from Wells Fargo executive, starting in the fifth paragraph.) Wells Fargo & Co. WFC, -2.84% revealed plans to start its own aircraft-leasing company, switching its focus from lending to ownership in the $100 billion-a-year market for financing commercial jets. U.S. commercial banks long have been active lenders to airlines, but Wells Fargo is the first in 20 years to seek ownership risk in an effort to boost returns from its balance sheet. Wells Fargo's move comes a year after the bank lost out to three Japanese institutions who agreed to pay $7.3 billion for the aircraft-leasing unit of Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS, RBS.LN). The new venture is much smaller, as Wells Fargo teams with Irish aircraft lessor Avolon to take a majority stake in a new Dublin-based firm that plans to build an initial fleet of around 10 jets valued at $500 million, buying new planes from airlines and leasing them back. ""For us, this is an interesting opportunity for us to understand the business better,"" said Dave Hoyt, head of wholesale banking at Wells Fargo. Mr. Hoyt declined to comment on the bank's pursuit of the RBS Aviation unit last year, though he noted its role in other transportation-finance areas such as rail-car leasing. Domhnal Slattery, Avolon's chief executive, said other large U.S. banks likely would follow Wells Fargo into a business he believes has moved from the esoteric into the mainstream, with a risk profile seen as lower than that of real estate. ""There's a void now,"" said Mr. Slattery, referring to the withdrawal of many large European banks from the aircraft sector because of capital constraints imposed by the region's financial crisis. Airlines increasingly are opting to rent rather than buy planes because of their own weak financial position and the desire for more flexibility to secure new, more fuel-efficient jets such as the planned Airbus A320neo and the Boeing 737 Max. Mr. Slattery, who formerly ran the now-sold RBS business, said banks in China and Japan have bought heavily into the leasing sector over the past year, with institutions in Canada and Australia also expressing interest. American International Group Inc. AIG, -2.25% is in the process of selling control of its International Lease Finance Corp. unit to a Chinese consortium for $4.23 billion in cash. ILFC is the world's second largest aircraft-leasing company by assets, eclipsed only by the Gecas unit of General Electric Co. GE, -2.79% CIT Group Inc. CIT, -0.91% and the Aviation Capital Group unit of insurer Pacific Life also have large aircraft-leasing units. A flurry of deals last year saw Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc. (SMFG, 8316.TO) along with Sumitomo Mitsui Finance and Leasing Co. and Sumitomo Corp. (SSUMY, 8053.TO) beat out Wells Fargo and China's CDB Leasing to buy RBS Aviation. Private-equity firms also became active over the past decade, and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc. (MTU, 8306.TO) last year paid $1.3 billion for Jackson Square Aviation, an aircraft-leasing company formerly owned by Oaktree Capital Group LLC OAK, -0.51% Wells Fargo is already a lender to Avolon, which was launched in 2011 with backing from three private-equity firms, subsequently securing funding from a Singapore sovereign wealth fund.

OAK,"NEW YORK--Oaktree Capital Group LLC OAK, -0.87% reported better-than-expected third-quarter economic earnings Tuesday, buoyed by a sharp increase in investment and incentive incomes. Oaktree, best known for its distressed-debt investments, said it concluded fundraising for its latest distressed debt fund, Oaktree Opportunities Fund IX, L.P., at $5 billion. During the third quarter, it also raised $255 million for its real-estate fund and over $500 million for a fund that invests in senior loan assets. The two funds are expected to raise a total of $3 billion when fundraising efforts end next year. Oaktree's assets under management rose to $81 billion as of Sept. 30 from $78.7 billion at the end of June and $73 billion a year ago. In the third quarter, Oaktree said its economic net income was $368 million, or $2.22 a share, reversing from an economic net loss of $443.3 million, or $2.56 a share, a year earlier. Private-equity firms and the analysts who cover them generally view economic net income as a preferred measure of performance because it includes unrealized gains and employee compensation while excluding continuing costs related to the firms' initial public offerings. The metric also accounts for all units, not just those that are publicly traded. Adjusted net income, which Oaktree prefers as it excludes unrealized performance fees, jumped to $157.7 million from $3.3 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, adjusted net income was 88 cents a share compared with a loss of 1 cent a share a year ago. Analysts' expectations were for earnings of 74 cents apiece in a poll by Thomson Reuters. Distributable earnings, or cash flow to investors, rose 10% to $120.4 million from $109.4 million a year ago. Under generally accepted accounting principles, Oaktree swung to a third-quarter net profit of $25.2 million, from a net loss of $36.5 million a year earlier. Total revenue rose to $304.6 million from $183.4 million a year earlier. The credit market remained resilient in the third quarter and the Standard & Poor's 500 index rose 6%, benefiting Oaktree's investments. ""Building on the investment success that underlies these results, as well as our expertise in credit, we're focused on exciting opportunities ahead in real estate, emerging markets, corporate credit and distressed debt,"" said Chairman Howard Marks in a statement. The firm, which has been focused on distressed assets in developed countries, is preparing to launch a new fund focused on similar opportunities in emerging markets. Los Angeles-based Oaktree, whose shares were listed on the New York Stock Exchange after an IPO in April, recently rose above its IPO price of $43 a share. Its shares closed 0.4% to $43.18 Monday.

OAK,"SYDNEY--Talks between creditors of Australian television network Nine Entertainment and Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners to prevent the company going into administration will continue into Wednesday, said a spokesman representing the U.S. investment bank. ""Our position remains unchanged and talks will continue tomorrow,"" a spokesman for Goldman Sachs Mezzanine Partners, or GSMP, told The Wall Street Journal Tuesday after a day of meetings had failed to deliver a definitive outcome. GSMP is in talks with U.S. hedge funds Apollo Global Management and Oaktree Capital on a deal to convert a total of 3.3 billion Australian dollars (US$3.4 billion) of debt into equity. The hedge funds control about A$1 billion of Nine's senior debt. Despite the insistence from GSMP that talks are ongoing, a person close to Apollo and Oaktree said Tuesday that a deal had been agreed.

OAK,"One of the world's largest investors is threatening to boycott any stock market listing that allows minority shareholders to control a majority of the votes through multi-tier share structures and will oppose those that already exist. Social network Facebook Inc. FB, -2.80% UK football club Manchester United and Oaktree Capital Group OAK, -0.88% a distressed fund manager, have all recently listed with multiple shares structures. The California Public Employees' Retirement System, the US's largest pension fund with $237 billion in assets under management, is drawing up new corporate governance criteria under which it will campaign to remove dual class, classified or plurality voting structures and not invest in initial public offerings which use them. One in eight of this year's 98 US IPOs listed in the year to August 16 had more than two classes of shares, according to investment banking research provider Dealogic. When Dealogic started tracking this metric in 2009, the figure was almost one in 12. Calpers has updated its governance demands in the face of this increase in dual-class voting structures and other corporate moves it sees as anti-governance. Sarah Wilson, chief executive of U.K. proxy voting firm Manifest, said: ""This sends out an important message. Where Calpers leads, others will follow."" Calpers is well known for its corporate governance campaigns. This year, it voted against the compensation plan for Vikram Pandit, chief executive of Citigroup, which became the first large US bank to lose a shareholder vote on pay. In the U.K., asset managers are pushing for poorly governed, newly listed companies to be kept out of the FTSE 100 index, where they would attract capital from passive fund managers.

Due to its favorable working capital cycle and deferred revenue contribution, Apple has been churning out cash flow at close to 120% of earnings (actually 128% in FY2012). Looking forward to CY2012, that rate suggests cash flow in excess of $50 per share in 2012. Ignoring repatriation tax for a moment, at $445 per share less $104 per share in net cash, we were creating Apple at 6-7x CY2012 free cash flow. Looking toward year-end 2012, with over $150 per share in net cash, Apple's multiple dropped to 5-6x CY2012 free cash flow. As a result, we believed we were buying in with a healthy margin of safety, a likely cash return catalyst and a favorable product cycle. This strong cash position and cash flow made the prospect of a cash return strategy very likely. Even allowing for a healthy sense of skepticism, Apple's close to $100 billion of net cash is greater than that of Microsoft, Google GOOG, -2.95% Facebook and Nokia combined.""

OAK,"Three U.S. IPOs encountered a mixed reception Thursday, with the best performance coming from oilfield parts company Forum Energy Technologies Inc. FET, -4.77% Forum Energy, which made a modest 12.5% gain at the open after pricing its initial public offering at the high end of its expected range, was joined by oil and gas industry parts supplier MRC Global Inc. (MRC) and investment management firm Oaktree Capital Group LLC (OAK), both of which declined at the open. MRC managed to inch above its IPO price in the first hour of trading, but later declined again, while Oaktree remained down. The three deals, which debuted on the New York Stock Exchange, are the final ones expected this week following a rocky period of broader market instability. Although U.S. stocks were trading higher Thursday and closed up Wednesday, the five previous trading sessions had seen declines. Earlier this week, one other IPO, from specialty helicopter company Erickson Air-Crane Inc. (EAC), ended the day flat after cutting its price and share size. Two other deals that had been expected, from aluminum processor Aleris Corp. and solar-technology company BrightSource Energy Inc., never materialized. Aleris postponed its offering and BrightSource withdrew, citing market conditions. Forum Energy and MRC Global had garnered good investor feedback during their road shows, but Forum was the bigger draw, with a more diversified business of subsea and land-based products, and success at new product development. Oaktree received lower marks from analysts than Forum Energy and MRC Global, and warned from the start that investors in its IPO should expect its financial results to fluctuate significantly, without steady earnings growth. It also told buyers they should plan to hold on to their Class A shares for a number of years to maximize their opportunity to profit from their investment, and that it doesn't plan to provide earnings guidance. Forum Energy sold 18.9 million shares--three million more than planned--at $20 apiece, the high end of its range. Its shares were changing hands recently at $22.10, up 10.5%. Based in Houston, Forum Energy makes products and parts used in land-based and offshore oil and gas exploration and development. In 2011, about 40% of its revenue came from the sale of capital products such as crane systems or unmanned submarines for a range of projects, including building new drilling rigs or subsea construction. About 53% of its revenue came from consumable products, spare parts or after-market services, with the remainder coming from rental or other sources. The company operates globally, with 39% of its 2011 revenue derived from outside the U.S. Its customers include drilling contractors, subsea construction companies, and pipeline and refinery operators. The company said in its prospectus that it believes several trends will positively affect its business in coming years, including the increasing complexity of well construction, growth in development of unconventional drilling in shale and tight sand formations, and development of more deep-water wells. It plans to expand its markets, grow through acquisitions and develop new products, such as a new subsea drill it designed to be used in deep water using a remotely operated vehicle for power and control. In 2011, the company's revenue increased 51% to $1.1 billion, while net income nearly quadrupled to $94 million compared to 2010. MRC Global, which distributes parts to the energy industry, sold 22.7 million shares at $21, the low end of its expected range. The company's shares were changing hands recently at $20.88, down less than 1%. MRC, headquartered in Houston, is the largest global industrial distributor of pipe, valves and fittings to the energy industry, based on sales. The products it sells are used by oil and gas-drilling companies, pipeline companies, refineries and other energy-sector firms. Besides selling parts, the company provides services such as product testing, manufacturer assessments and technical support. MRC's preliminary first-quarter results show sales at about $1.3 billion, up from $992 million, and net income of $30 million to $36 million compared to a net loss of $1.1 million in the same period a year ago. In 2011, sales rose 26% to $4.8 billion, and the company reported net income of $29 million compared to a net loss of $52 million in 2010. Most of what MRC sells are products that are often used in extreme operating environments, so they need to be replaced regularly. About two-thirds of its sales are attributable to multi-year maintenance, repair and operations contracts, with an average annual retention rate for these contracts since 2000 running at 95%. MRC's backlog of customer orders, which it says is a relatively good general indicator of overall activity for the company, was $823 million on Dec. 31, up 41% from a year earlier. Meanwhile, investment-management firm Oaktree drew the least interest, selling 8.8 million Class A units--down from its plans for 11.25 million--at $43, the low end of its range. It was changing hands recently at $42.44, down 1.3%. Oaktree, with $74.9 billion in assets as of Dec. 31, specializes in debt investing. Its clients include 73 of the 100 largest U.S. pension plans, 39 U.S. states, more than 350 corporations, more than 300 university, charitable and other endowments and foundations, and six of the top 10 sovereign-wealth-fund nations. The company says its business generates a high level of earnings and cash flow; it has been able to make equity distributions every quarter since 1996; and has had positive adjusted net income for the last 16 years. But there are a lot of negatives for public shareholders to consider. The company says it gives its clients' interest top priority, and may reduce its assets under management, restrain its growth, reduce its fees or otherwise change its terms even in circumstances where other firms might feel such actions are unnecessary. It warns that investors in its IPO should expect its financial results to fluctuate significantly, and that they shouldn't plan on steady earnings growth. Unit holders who don't like the way Oaktree is being run won't have much recourse; the principals of the firm will control the appointment and removal of all directors, determine all matters submitted to the board, and determine the outcome of all matters submitted to a shareholder vote. In 2011, Oaktree's total revenue declined 24% to $156 million as both management fees and incentive income declined, and its net loss grew to $96 million compared to a loss of $49.5 million in 2010. Adjusted net income for its investment-management segment declined to $428 million from $764 million in 2010. Its assets under management declined 9.4% to $74.9 billion; although the market value of its funds rose, net outflows of $6 billion by closed-end funds were the primary contributor to the decline, reflecting distributions of $10.5 billion and cancellations of uncalled capital commitments of $1.2 billion, partially offset by new capital commitments of $5.7 billion. A single fund, Opps VIIb, began its liquidation period in May 2011, and accounted for 68.4% of total closed-end fund distributions and uncalled capital commitments during the year.

OAK,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC and the related notes included within this annual report. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties and assumptions relating to our operations, financial results, financial condition, business prospects, growth strategy and liquidity. The factors listed under ""Risk Factors"" and ""Forward-Looking Statements"" in this annual report provide examples of risks, uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in any forward-looking statements. Business Overview Oaktree is a leader among global investment managers specializing in alternative investments, with $100.2 billion in AUM as of December 31, 2017. Our mission is to deliver superior investment results with risk under control and to conduct our business with the highest integrity. We emphasize an opportunistic, value-oriented and risk-controlled approach to investments in distressed debt, corporate debt (including high yield debt and senior loans), control investing, convertible securities, real estate and listed equities. Over more than three decades, we have developed a large and growing client base through our ability to identify and capitalize on opportunities for attractive investment returns in less efficient markets. We manage assets on behalf of many of the most significant institutional investors in the world. Our clientele includes 75 of the 100 largest U.S. pension plans, 38 state retirement plans in the United States, over 400 corporations and/or their pension funds, over 350 university, charitable and other endowments and foundations, over 15 sovereign wealth funds, and over 350 other non-U.S. institutional investors. As measured by AUM, approximately 73% of our clients are invested in two or more different investment strategies, and 37% are invested in four or more. Headquartered in Los Angeles, we serve these clients with over 900 employees and offices in 18 cities worldwide. Our business is comprised of one segment, our investment management business, which consists of the investment management services that we provide to our clients. Our revenue flows from the management fees and incentive income generated by the funds that we manage, as well as the investment income earned from the investments we make in our funds, third-party funds and other companies. The management fees that we receive are based on the contractual terms of the relevant fund and are typically calculated as a fixed percentage of the capital commitments (as adjusted for distributions during a fund's liquidation period), drawn capital, cost basis or NAV of the particular fund. Incentive income represents our share (typically 20%) of the investors' profits in most of the closed-end and evergreen funds. Investment income reflects the investment return on a mark-to-market basis and our equity participation on the amounts that we invest in Oaktree and third-party funds, as well as in CLOs and other companies. Business Environment and Developments As a global investment manager, we are affected by a wide range of factors, including the condition of the global economy and financial markets; the relative attractiveness of our investment strategies and investors' demand for them; and regulatory or other governmental policies or actions. Global economic conditions can significantly impact the values of our funds' investments and our ability to make new investments or sell existing investments for our funds. Historically, however, the diversified nature of both our investment strategies and our revenue mix has generally allowed us to benefit from both strong and weak economic environments. Weak economies and the declining financial markets that typically accompany them tend to dampen our revenues from asset-based management fees, investment realizations or price appreciation, but their prospect can present us with opportunities to raise relatively larger amounts of capital for certain strategies, especially Distressed Debt. Additionally, weak financial markets may also present us with more opportunities to make investments for our funds at reduced prices. Conversely, strong financial markets generally increase the value of our funds' investments, which positions us for growth in management fees that are based on asset value, and typically create favorable exit opportunities that enhance the prospect for incentive income and fund-related investment income proceeds. Those same markets may delay or diminish opportunities to deploy capital and thus management fees from certain of our funds. Global equity markets produced strong gains in 2017, generally supported by positive corporate earnings and global economic data, low unemployment rates, and the passing of new tax legislation in December lowering corporate tax rates. U.S. equities reached all-time highs in 2017, with the S&P 500 Index and Russell 2000 Index finishing the year with total returns of 21.8% and 14.6%, respectively. Non-U.S. equities, in general, outperformed U.S. markets, with the MSCI ACWI ex-USA Index returning 27.2% for the year. Emerging market equities, as measured by the MSCI Emerging Markets Index, returned 37.5%, and European equity markets, as measured by the MSCI Europe Index, returned 26.3%. Credit markets performed relatively well for the year, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve having hiked short-term interest rates three times during 2017. U.S. high yield bonds, as measured by the Citigroup U.S. High Yield Cash-Pay Capped Index, returned 6.9%, and emerging market bonds, as measured by the JP Morgan Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index (CEMBI), returned 10.5%. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield finished 2017 at 2.40%, slightly down from 2.45% at the beginning of the year. Understanding Our Results-Consolidation of Oaktree Funds Generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP"") requires us to consolidate entities in which we have a direct or indirect controlling financial interest based on either a variable interest model or voting interest model. We adopted the new consolidation guidance on January 1, 2016 on a modified retrospective basis. As a result, prior periods were not recast. There was no impact on retained earnings or net income attributable to us. Under the new consolidation guidance, a limited partnership or similar entity is a variable interest entity (""VIE"") if the unaffiliated limited partners do not have substantive kick-out or participating rights. Most of the Oaktree funds are VIEs because they have not granted unaffiliated limited partners substantive kick-out or participating rights. Oaktree consolidates those VIEs in which we are the primary beneficiary. For entities that are not VIEs, consolidation is evaluated through a majority voting interest model. Please see note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for more information. Expenses Equity-based Compensation Expense Included in ANI 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Thereafter Total (in millions) Estimated expense from equity grants awarded through December 2017 $ 44.5 $ 37.5 $ 22.5 $ 9.6 $ 6.7 $ 14.3 $ 135.1  Incentive Income Compensation expenses are net of amounts borne by fund investors and are not offset by credits attributable to fund investors' non-controlling interests in consolidated funds. For 2017, other income (expense), net included $145.1 million of income related to the remeasurement of our tax receivable agreement liability in connection with the Tax Act and the $22.0 million make-whole premium expense related to the early repayment of our $250.0 million 6.75% senior notes due 2019. Income Taxes  Net Income Attributable to Non-controlling Interests in Consolidated Subsidiaries. This category primarily represents the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH (""OCGH non-controlling interest""), as well as the economic interest in certain consolidated subsidiaries held by third parties. The OCGH non-controlling interest is determined at the Oaktree Operating Group level based on the weighted average proportionate share of Oaktree Operating Group units held by the OCGH unitholders. Inasmuch as the number of outstanding Oaktree Operating Group units corresponds with the total number of outstanding Class A and OCGH units, changes in the economic interest held by the OCGH unitholders are driven by our additional issuances of Class A and OCGH units, as well as repurchases and forfeitures of, and exchanges between, Class A and OCGH units. Certain of our expenses, such as income tax and related administrative expenses of Oaktree Capital Group, LLC and its Intermediate Holding Companies, are solely attributable to the Class A unitholders. Please see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report for additional information on the economic interest in the Oaktree Operating Group owned by OCGH.

The Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Issuer, jointly and severally guaranteed by the Guarantors. Funding of the Notes is anticipated to occur on December 18, 2017. In connection with the Notes offering, the Issuer entered into a cross-currency swap agreement to Euros, reducing the interest cost to 1.95% per year.

The redemption of the 2019 Notes is expected to result in a one-time, pre-tax charge of approximately $23 million to adjusted net income in the fourth quarter of 2017. For distributable earnings, the charge will be amortized through the original maturity date of December 2019. Dan Levin, Chief Financial Officer, said, “With the completion of this refinancing and Euro swap, we will reduce our interest cost by over 475 basis points to less than 2% and extend the maturity of this principal amount by 13 years, generating approximately $12 million in annual interest cost savings. Many of the existing holders of our outstanding private notes participated in this transaction, and we appreciate their ongoing support.” The offer and sale of the Notes were and will be made solely in private placement transactions exempt from registration pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”).
