ABCD,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. This section should be read in conjunction with the Consolidated Financial Statements of the Company and the notes thereto included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2017. Organization of Information Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations includes the following sections: Form of Organization and Segments Long-Term Strategy Results of Operations Liquidity and Capital Resources Summary of Cash Flows Commitments and Contractual Obligations Non-GAAP Measures Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Recently Issued Financial Accounting Standards Form of Organization and Segments Continue to invest in innovative education technology solutions. Our products and programs are designed to help teachers around the world address the increasingly wide range of individual needs and potential of every student in their classroom. We believe that leveraging technology will help us better serve teachers and students, and that school districts will continue to shift more spending to technology products. Nurture relationships with customers. We believe in the importance of the teacher's role as the key to learning and the single most important catalyst for learners in the foreseeable future. Products and professional services are designed to increase teacher effectiveness by providing information about their students, the resources to propel their students forward, and the professional development to have teachers increase both their own skills and those of their students. Forge strong partnerships with our customers. We are committed to stellar customer service and expert implementation and training services. As part of this commitment, we place high importance on cybersecurity, and provide vigilance and protection over privacy and data security for the students who use our products. We may also enhance our organic growth through opportunistic acquisitions that leverage the strength of our existing brands or that include technology solutions with adaptive features. ExploreLearning: $31.0 million, increased 19%, with double-digit growth for both the Reflex math product and the Gizmos math and science simulations. Voyager Sopris Learning: $52.6 million, decreased 16%, primarily due to a decline in the segment's legacy print and transactional solutions, which are not the strategic focus of the segment, and were 21% lower than prior year. Bookings for the segment's technology-enabled solutions declined 3%, falling short of Company expectations for growth this year with slow traction for the new Velocity solution combined with an expected decline in many of the older technology offerings. LANGUAGE! Live, the segment's digital flagship solution for technology-enabled adolescent intervention, had strong growth of 20% during the year. We continue to execute our strategy to shift resources to subscription and technology-enabled products. For the year ended December 31, 2017, Bookings for technology-enabled products represented approximately 79% of Bookings compared to 73% in 2016. For purposes of this metric, technology-enabled products are defined as those products that are sold primarily as a technology-based solution or that could be used solely via a digital platform. For the Voyager Sopris Learning segment, several products classified as technology-enabled include supplemental print materials.

The increase in net revenues is a lower percentage than the increase in Bookings due to the timing of the subscription revenues pro-rata over the applicable subscription periods. Voyager Sopris Learning's net revenues decreased $7.4 million, or 11.8%, to $55.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016 as a result of Voyager Sopris Learning's Bookings decline. The decline was less than the Bookings decline of 15.8% due to the recognition of prior period Bookings for technology deliverables, which are recognized pro rata over the applicable subscription periods. Service revenues are primarily related to the delivery of LETRS professional development training. Cost of revenues primarily include print and royalty costs, and expenses to purchase, handle and warehouse product, and to provide services and support to customers. Total cost of revenues, excluding amortization, decreased $2.6 million, or 8.5%, to $27.6 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Cost of revenues benefited year-over-year from the cost right-sizing activities at Voyager Sopris Learning, as well as the increasing contribution from higher-margin technology-enabled solutions. The Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning segments, which are delivered on-line and have no royalty costs, comprised 65.1% of net revenues in 2017 compared to 58.9% of net revenues in 2016. Cost of revenues by segment were as follows: ExploreLearning's cost of revenues increased $0.1 million, or 3.7%, to $3.7 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. The increased costs were related to implementation and training due to the segment's increased level of customer support commensurate with Bookings growth. Voyager Sopris Learning's cost of revenues decreased $3.8 million, or 15.7%, to $20.2 million in the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. This year-over-year decline was driven by lower net revenues and the cost right-sizing activities completed in 2016. Voyager Sopris Learning's cost of revenues included restructuring costs of $0.3 million in 2017 and $0.4 million in 2016. Cost of service revenues are primarily related to the delivery of LETRS professional development training. Amortization expense in cost of revenues includes amortization for acquired pre-publication costs and technology, acquired publishing rights, and developed pre-publication and technology product development. Amortization decreased $0.2 million to $18.0 million in 2017 compared to $18.1 million for same period of 2016. The change was due to decreased amortization of acquired publishing rights and curriculum of $1.2 million, partially offset by increased amortization of developed pre-publication and technology product development of $1.0 million.

The increase in net revenues is due to ExploreLearning's continued strong Bookings performance. Voyager Sopris Learning's net revenues were $17.9 million, decreasing $1.6 million, or 8.2%, during the quarter ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. The year-over-year decline in revenues is the result of Voyager Sopris Learning's Bookings decline. Cost of revenues ExploreLearning's cost of revenues increased slightly by $0.1 million to $1.0 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Voyager Sopris Learning's cost of revenues decreased $1.3 million or 17.9%, to $6.1 million in the quarter ended September 30, 2017 compared to $7.4 million in the third quarter of 2016. The decrease in cost of revenues was due to the year-over-year decline in revenue, the cost right-sizing activities completed in 2016 and the third quarter 2016 restructuring costs of $0.4 million. Amortization expense in cost of revenues includes amortization for acquired pre-publication costs and technology, acquired publishing rights, and developed pre-publication and technology product development. Amortization expense was $4.7 million in the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to the same period of 2016. The change was due to a decrease in amortization of acquired publishing rights and curriculum of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in amortization of developed pre-publication and technology product development of $0.2 million.

We continue to execute our strategy to shift resources to subscription and technology-enabled products, which generally have higher margins than print and transactional products. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, technology-enabled products represented approximately 71% of Bookings versus 62% for the same period of 2016. For purposes of this metric, technology-enabled products are defined as those products that are sold primarily as a technology-based solution or that could be used solely via a digital platform. For the Voyager Sopris Learning segment, several products classified as technology-enabled include supplemental print materials.  2016 Three Months Ended Year-Over-Year Change June 30, 2017 June 30, 2016 Favorable/(Unfavorable) % of Net % of Net (in thousands) Amount Revenues Amount Revenues $ % Net revenues: Learning A-Z $ 18,650 46.2 % $ 15,881 40.6 % $ 2,769 17.4 % ExploreLearning 6,735 16.7 % 5,753 14.7 % 982 17.1 % Voyager Sopris Learning 14,977 37.1 % 17,450 44.6 % (2,473 ) (14.2 )% Total net revenues 40,362 100.0 % 39,084 100.0 % 1,278 3.3 % Cost of revenues: Learning A-Z 942 2.3 % 583 1.5 % (359 ) (61.6 )% ExploreLearning 808 2.0 % 786 2.0 % (22 ) (2.8 )% Voyager Sopris Learning 5,465 13.5 % 6,363 16.3 % 898 14.1 % Amortization expense 4,328 10.7 % 4,475 11.4 % 147 3.3 % Total cost of revenues 11,543 28.6 % 12,207 31.2 % 664 5.4 % Research and development expense 3,294 8.2 % 3,019 7.7 % (275 ) (9.1 )% Sales and marketing expense 12,190 30.2 % 11,846 30.3 % (344 ) (2.9 )% General and administrative expense 5,009 12.4 % 5,102 13.1 % 93 1.8 % Shipping and handling costs 195 0.5 % 221 0.6 % 26 11.8 % Depreciation and amortization expense 669 1.7 % 856 2.2 % 187 21.8 % Income before interest and income taxes 7,462 18.5 % 5,833 14.9 % 1,629 27.9 % Net interest expense (1,336 ) (3.3 )% (1,958 ) (5.0 )% 622 31.8 % Income tax expense (334 ) (0.8 )% (111 ) (0.3 )% (223 ) (200.9 )% Net income $ 5,792 14.4 % $ 3,764 9.6 % $ 2,028 53.9 %  Net revenues ExploreLearning's net revenues were $6.7 million, increasing $1.0 million, or 17.1%, during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. The increase in net revenues is a lower percentage than the increase in Bookings of 23.5% due to the deferral of current period Bookings, which are recognized pro rata over the applicable subscription periods. Voyager Sopris Learning's net revenues were $15.0 million, decreasing $2.5 million, or 14.2%, during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. The year-over-year decline in revenues is the result of Voyager Sopris Learning's Bookings decline. The decline in net revenues was less than the Bookings decline of 18.6% due to the recognition of prior period Bookings for technology deliverables, which are recognized pro rata over the applicable subscription periods. Cost of revenues ExploreLearning's cost of revenues were consistent at $0.8 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to the same period of 2016. Voyager Sopris Learning's cost of revenues decreased $0.9 million, to $5.5 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to $6.4 million in the second quarter of 2016. The decrease in cost of revenues was due to the year-over-year decline in revenue, coupled with savings from careful expense management and the cost right-sizing activities completed in 2016. Amortization expense in cost of revenues includes amortization for acquired pre-publication costs and technology, acquired publishing rights, and developed pre-publication and technology product development. Amortization expense was $4.3 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of $0.1 million compared to the same period of 2016. The change was due to a decrease in amortization of acquired publishing rights and curriculum of $0.3 million, partially offset by an increase in amortization of developed pre-publication and technology product development of $0.2 million.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Financial Highlights Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 4% to $158.2 million compared with $152.4 million in 2016. GAAP net revenues by segment for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to prior year were as follows:  - Learning A-Z [(R) ] - $75.1 million, increased $9.1 million or 14%  - ExploreLearning [(R) ] - $27.9 million, increased $4.1 million or 17%  - Voyager Sopris Learning [(R) ] - $55.2 million, decreased $(7.4) million or (12)%.  Bookings for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased by 2% to $164.4 million compared with $161.8 million in 2016, with growth of $7.5 million at Learning A-Z and $4.9 million at ExploreLearning, partially offset by a Voyager Sopris Learning Bookings decline of $9.8 million.  Technology-enabled Bookings represented 79% of total 2017 Bookings compared with 73% of 2016 Bookings, and grew 10% compared to 2016.  Net interest expense was $4.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, down $2.3 million from 2016 as a result of the scheduled debt amortization payments and voluntary prepayments.  The Company recorded a non-cash goodwill impairment charge of $4.3 million related to the Kurzweil Education brand solutions, which experienced a Bookings decline of 9% in 2017 and is now fully integrated within the Voyager Sopris Learning segment structure.  The Company recorded an income tax benefit of $30.2 million and $29.3 million for the quarter and year ended December 31, 2017, respectively, predominantly the result of a reduction of the valuation allowance against most of the Company's deferred tax assets offset by a remeasurement of deferred tax assets at the newly-enacted corporate tax rate.  Net income was $45.1 million during the year ended December 31, 2017, up $34.6 million when compared to a net income of $10.4 million during the year ended December 31, 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $49.0 million, up $6.2 million from 2016. Excluding the effect of the tax benefit on net income, the increase in GAAP net revenues, along with a greater portion of the top-line mix coming from the higher margin Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning segments, drove improvement in both net income and Adjusted EBITDA.  In response to lower-than-expected performance at the Voyager Sopris Learning segment in 2017, management completed restructuring activities to reduce its cost structure, and incurred $1.1 million of severance costs in the fourth quarter, in addition to the $0.3 million of severance costs incurred in the third quarter. These restructuring costs are excluded from the Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income non-GAAP measures.

Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights GAAP net revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 2% to $38.3 million compared with $37.5 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. GAAP net revenues by segment for the three months ended December 31, 2017, and the change from the same period of 2016, were as follows:  - Learning A-Z - $19.8 million, increased $1.9 million or 10%  - ExploreLearning - $7.2 million, increased $1.0 million or 15%  - Voyager Sopris Learning - $11.3 million, decreased $(2.0) million or (15)%  Bookings for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 7% to $37.0 million compared with $34.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2016.  The Company reported net income of $30.3 million during the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to a net income of $2.9 million during the fourth quarter of 2016, an increase of $27.3 million. GAAP net income includes an income tax benefit of $30.2 million and a goodwill impairment charge of $4.3 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.9 million, increasing $1.0 million from $11.9 million in 2016. Excluding the effect of the tax benefit and goodwill impairment on net income, the increase in GAAP net revenues, along with a greater portion of the top-line mix coming from the higher margin Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning segments, drove improvement in both net income and Adjusted EBITDA.  Net interest expense was $1.0 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, down $0.6 million from the fourth quarter of 2016 as a result of the scheduled debt amortization payments and voluntary prepayments made during 2016.  Cash Income was $7.5 million, an increase of $1.2 million compared to Cash Income of $6.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Capital expenditures totaled $4.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 versus $3.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2016. Fiscal Year 2017 Segment Discussion Net Revenues, Bookings, Net Income, and Cash Income changes by segment for the three months and year ended December 31, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016 were:   Q4 - 2017 % Change   YTD - 2017 % Change   Net Revenues Bookings Net Income Cash Income   Net Revenues Bookings Net Income Cash Income Learning A-Z 10 % 14 % 14 % 12 %   14 % 10 % 15 % 8 % ExploreLearning 15 % 21 % 4 % 12 %   17 % 19 % 24 % 28 % Voyager Sopris Learning (15 )% (19 )% (42 )% 3 %   (12 )% (16 )% (13 )% (23 )% Shared Services     229 % (7 )%       66 % 5 % Cambium Learning Group, Inc. 2 % 7 % 929 % 19 %   4 % 2 % 332 % 13 % Bookings increased 2% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. By segment: Learning A-Z reported Bookings growth of $7.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016, representing a double-digit year over year growth rate of 10%.  ExploreLearning reported a $4.9 million, or 19%, Bookings increase for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 with double-digit growth for both the Reflex [(R)] math product and the Gizmos [(R)] math and science simulations.  Voyager Sopris Learning reported a Bookings decline of $(9.8) million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016. The Bookings decline of (16)% came primarily from the segment's legacy print and transactional solutions, which are not the strategic focus of the segment, and were 21% lower than prior year. Bookings for the segment's technology-enabled solutions declined 3%, falling short of Company expectations for growth this year, as slow traction for the new Velocity [(R)] solution combined with an expected decline in many of the older technology offerings. LANGUAGE! Live [(R)] , the segment's digital flagship solution for technology-enabled adolescent intervention, had strong growth of 20% during the year. 2018 Outlook Mr. Campbell concluded, ""Our 2017 results show our continued focus on increasing cash generation and the long term value of the company. For 2018, we expect improved top-line growth, coupled with disciplined expense management, while investing in development, marketing and sales, should drive continued expansion in our Cash Income, Adjusted EBITDA, and cash flow generation. Cambium Learning's mission is to leverage technology to create solutions that are personalized, adaptive, scalable, and designed to achieve results in the classroom that can change the trajectory of students' lives. Demand for these solutions is strong, and we are poised and ready to execute well and to deliver strong financial results in 2018."" Company-wide, management is setting an initial outlook for 2018 Bookings growth at a higher percentage than 2017, with most of the growth expected in the second half of the year during the Company's seasonally strong periods. Cambium Learning Group's business is highly seasonal, with Bookings historically peaking during the third quarter, which represents by far the preponderance of Bookings, revenue, and income each year, and management expects to refine its Bookings outlook as the year progresses. The Company expects its 2018 Bookings growth to be driven by its two 100% technology subscription businesses Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning. Voyager Sopris Learning is expected to build on the momentum of the LANGUAGE! Live solution and continue to make progress on repositioning the segment's role in the intervention marketplace. The Company expects 2018 capital expenditures to be roughly consistent with 2017 and expects growth in its Cash Income margin from 2017, with the impact of spending on strategic investments in its technology subscription products offset by the ongoing benefit of the transition in mix to these higher margin product lines. Absent another use of cash during the year, the Company expects to be substantially debt free by the end of 2018.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Income are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly named, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect the underlying performance of the ongoing operations of the Company and provide investors with a view of the Company's operations from management's perspective. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income remove significant restructuring, non-operational, or certain non-cash items from earnings. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income to monitor and evaluate the operating performance of the Company and as the basis to set and measure progress toward performance targets. Further, the Cash Income measure directly affects compensation for employees and executives. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP measures as measures of operating performance and not as measures of the Company's liquidity. The Company's presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual, non-operational, or non-cash items.

ABCD,"DALLAS, Feb 06, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Voyager Sopris Learning [(R)] today launched a flexible, blended version of LETRS(R) (Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling), its respected professional development course of study that prepares educators for the challenging work of teaching literacy. Backed by more than 30 years of evidence-based, scientific research and more than a decade of proven success, LETRSis relied upon by thousands of educators, as it helps teachers understand and apply the science of effective reading instruction. Voyager Sopris Learning President Aaron Ingold says the new version of LETRS, for elementary grades, now offers embedded video, online assignments, interactive exercises, and bridges the transition from learning new information to application of effective strategies and skills for student success. The classroom video clips are designed to provide models for instruction and connect to the science of reading and writing. ""This exciting new version of LETRS is very applicable to what teachers do every day, and they can immediately apply what they learn,"" Ingold said. ""With LETRS now online, it's a very flexible solution providing multiple delivery methods--online, blended, or in-person--and can be accessed anywhere, anytime, and most significantly, on the teacher's terms."" According to Dr. Louisa C. Moats, nationally recognized literacy expert and lead author of LETRS, research shows 95 percent of first graders can be taught to read, and much reading failure can be prevented if instruction builds the critical underlying language skills on which reading depends. ""The harsh reality, however, is that far too many students are poor readers; by fourth grade, on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, about 31 percent remain 'below basic' on the test of reading ability,"" Dr. Moats said. ""While it is important for classrooms to be well stocked with great books, most students must be taught how to read them. They need teachers who know how to teach the foundational skills of reading (phoneme awareness, phonics, and word reading) as well as vocabulary and language comprehension. Teaching reading is complex and challenging, and most teachers benefit enormously from learning what we teach in LETRS."" Districts that have trained their teachers using LETRS say their teachers exit the course of study with the background and depth of knowledge to teach language and literacy skills to every student. ""LETRS allowed us to use a common curriculum, and that allowed for the use of common practices,"" said Ann Marie Thigpen, superintendent of Niles City Schools in Ohio, whose district is a pilot testing site for the new LETRS. ""We were able to see gaps in teaching and resources, evaluate what to keep and what to get rid of, and re-evaluate the use of pull-out vs. push-in for Title I services. It gave us the springboard to change our instructional practices."" The new, easy-to-implement LETRS is designed as a two-year course. In the first year, areas of study include theoretical models from reading science, phonology, basic and advanced phonics, and screening and educational diagnostic assessment. The second year focuses on teaching vocabulary, language and reading comprehension, and writing. ""LETRS is the answer to helping teachers grow professionally and to empowering them to understand the what, why, and how of scientifically based reading instruction,"" Ingold said. ""As Dr. Moats often reminds us, 'informed teachers are our best insurance against reading failure.'"" Widely acclaimed as a researcher, speaker, consultant, and trainer, Dr. Moats co-authored the new LETRS with Dr. Carol A. Tolman. Dr. Tolman has spearheaded several successful, long-term literacy initiatives and has been a consultant at the state, district, and school levels for more than 15 years. The LETRS family features several other impactful professional development products, including a new version of LETRS for Early Childhood Educators (PreK-K). Also available are LETRS Classic (K-12), Connecting LETRS to the Classroom (K-3), and A Principal's Primer (K-8). Coming later in 2018 is an administrator's course for LETRS.

ABCD,"DALLAS, Jan 03, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- In just one year, student reading success at Rapides Parish Schools has improved dramatically after the implementation of a new teacher professional development course of study, Voyager Sopris Learning's LETRS--to the extent that one district administrator refers to the results as ""incredible."" Two years ago, administrators at Rapides Parish School Board in Louisiana arrived at the same conclusion other educators around the country have reached: Many of today's teachers have not been equipped with the skills to teach early foundational reading. In a district-wide effort to boost teachers' reading instructional skills, Rapides Parish assembled a selection committee and overwhelmingly selected Voyager Sopris Learning's LETRS(Language Essentials for Teachers of Reading and Spelling) professional development solution. Since Rapides Parish teachers began the program in the 2016-17 school year, district officials have been duly impressed with their progress. According to Alana Cohen, district curriculum specialist, Rapides Parish has witnessed gains of 33 percent from K-3 students on their STAR Early Literacy tests. In this diverse district that serves more than 25,000 K-12 students, Rapides Parish is making great strides in improving reading and literacy before students fall too far behind. ""Overwhelmingly our fourth-grade teachers are telling us how the kids are coming out of third grade knowing so much more now than before we had LETRS,"" Cohen said. To date, more than 300 teachers from Rapides Parish's lowest-performing elementary schools have received LETRS training, which offers more than a decade of demonstrated success in improving teacher effectiveness and focuses on raising preK-12 literacy achievement for all learners. LETRS provides teachers the background and depth of knowledge to teach language and literacy skills to every student and helps teachers recognize why some students struggle so that all students can become proficient readers. ""We are so excited to be a part of this,"" Cohen said. ""On a professional development level, things are clicking, and the results have been incredible."" Kimberly Bennett, executive assistant superintendent at Rapides Parish, said one of her district's primary goals has been to improve the reading level and skills of its K-3 students. ""Going through the process, the one question we had to answer was 'Do our teachers really understand the reading process?'"" Bennett said. ""For us, LETRS was the missing piece, especially with the shift in education where so many teachers are coming from non-traditional backgrounds to teach. It's imperative to us--teachers need to know how students learn to read to be able to effectively teach reading."" Mary Moore has been an educator in the Rapides Parish district for 25 years and is in her second year of LETRS training. ""I've had a lot of training over the years in phonics and phonemic awareness,"" said Moore, in her third year of teaching first grade. ""But the LETRS training modules are very helpful and remind me about the importance of doing these drills. Student engagement is more important today than ever before, and the research we've learned as part of LETRS about how the brain works helps us know how to keep the kids engaged."" Cohen echoed Moore's assessment and said LETRS has not only helped students improve their reading proficiency, but also has dramatically buoyed the confidence of the teachers who have gone through the training. ""For our teachers, true learning is occurring, and the light bulb is being turned on. So many of the teachers have said, 'How were we not taught these skills in college?'"" ""This is the story we're hearing around the country when districts start training with LETRS,"" said Aaron Ingold, president, Voyager Sopris Learning. ""These results at Rapides Parish are further proof that the skills teachers learn in LETRS training can be immediately applied to classroom practice, and students quickly benefit. Empowering every teacher to make a greater impact on student success is our goal.""

Adjusted EBITDA was $14.1 million, increasing $1.3 million from $12.8 million in 2016. The increase in GAAP net revenues, along with a greater portion of the top-line mix coming from the higher margin Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning segments, drove improvement in both net income and Adjusted EBITDA. Cash Income was $40.2 million for the third quarter of 2017 compared to Cash Income of $35.9 million for the third quarter of 2016, increasing 12% with the Company's highest margin segments driving the largest Bookings quarter in the Company's history. Capital expenditures totaled $5.1 million in the third quarter of 2017 versus $5.4 million in the third quarter of 2016. During October 2017, the Company voluntarily prepaid the remaining $9.6 million principal amount outstanding on the Term Loan B of the Senior Secured Credit Facility. The Company's ExploreLearning segment recently acquired Athens, Georgia-based startup IS3D, LLC, developers of Cogent Education(TM) Interactive Cases(TM)--dynamic online experiences that put students in the role of a STEM professional tasked with solving a real-world problem (www.cogenteducation.com). Cogent's award-winning Interactive Cases provide engaging and immersive contexts for learning difficult scientific concepts through authentic inquiry and problem solving. With initial availability expected by 2019, ExploreLearning plans to integrate Cogent Education resources into Gizmos, its award-winning online simulation library for grades 3-12 math and science. Year-to-Date 2017 Segment Discussion Net Revenues, Bookings, Net Income, and Cash Income changes by segment for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016 were as follows:   Q3 - 2017 % Change   YTD - 2017 % Change   Net Revenues Bookings Net Income Cash Income   Net Revenues Bookings Net Income Cash Income Learning A-Z 12 % 10 % 17 % 13 %   15 % 9 % 16 % 6 % ExploreLearning 16 % 18 % 26 % 24 %   18 % 18 % 31 % 35 % Voyager Sopris Learning (8 )% (4 )% (3 )% -- %   (11 )% (15 )% (5 )% (19 )% Shared Services     7 % (2 )%       6 % 9 % Cambium Learning Group, Inc. 3 % 6 % 69 % 12 %   4 % -- % 98 % 12 % Bookings increased slightly for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to 2016. By segment: Learning A-Z reported a 9% growth in Bookings for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to prior year. ExploreLearning reported an 18% growth in Bookings for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 versus prior year. This segment had double-digit growth for both the Reflex [(R)] math product and the Gizmos [(R)] math and science simulations. Voyager Sopris Learning reported a 15% Bookings decrease for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 versus prior year, with a third quarter decline of 4% showing some improvement over first half results. The Bookings decline came primarily from the segment's legacy print and transactional solutions, which are not the strategic focus of the segment, and were 21% lower than prior year. Bookings for the segment's technology-enabled solutions declined 2%, falling short of Company expectations for growth this year with slow traction for the new Velocity [(R)] solution combined with an expected decline in many of the older technology offerings. LANGUAGE! Live [(R)] , the segment's digital flagship solution for technology-enabled adolescent intervention, had strong growth of 23% year to date and 38% for the third quarter. In November 2017, in response to the lower-than-expected results at Voyager Sopris Learning, management completed restructuring activities to reduce its cost structure. The Company expects full-year restructuring costs to total $1.5 million, with severance expense of $0.3 million incurred in the third quarter and an additional $1.2 million expected in the fourth quarter, which will be excluded from Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income. The 2017 restructuring activities are expected to result in approximately $3.1 million of annualized savings at the Voyager Sopris Learning segment. A leaner cost base and a flatter management structure will provide this segment with flexibility, allowing Voyager Sopris Learning time to complete its transformation as it generates profits from declining legacy products while gaining traction on the fewer, more impactful educational solutions that are expected to drive top-line growth and margin expansion over time. 2017 Outlook Mr. Campbell concluded, ""After a strong start in July, third quarter Bookings growth moderated to some degree but, importantly, we continue to expect to end the year with double-digit top line growth at both Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning. Voyager Sopris Learning has had a challenging year, and although we saw sequential improvement in the seasonally important third quarter, we now expect Bookings to decline by at least 15% in 2017 compared to 2016, which will likely put our company-wide Bookings below our previous outlook. We have taken substantive additional action to right-size this segment's cost basis to maximize its profitability as it completes its transformation. The strong performance by our online subscription segments Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning is expected to drive expanded net income, increased Adjusted EBITDA, greater Cash Income profitability and higher cash flow generation over prior year."" The Company expects 2017 Bookings growth at Learning A-Z to be, given fourth quarter Bookings trends to date, at least 10%, and 2017 Bookings growth at ExploreLearning to be at least 17%. Bookings for the Voyager Sopris Learning segment are expected to decline by at least 15% over prior year. Company-wide Bookings growth for full year 2017 is expected to range between 1% and 4%, lower than the Company's previous outlook, driven largely by the lower than previously forecasted Bookings performance at the Voyager Sopris Learning segment. The Company expects 2017 capital expenditures to be roughly $19 million, with expenditures for product development ranging between $16 million and $17 million and the remainder for general capital expenditures. Full-year 2017 Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income margins are expected to grow slightly, expanding up to two percentage points compared to 2016. Company-wide top-line growth, coupled with continued careful expense management, is expected to drive expansion in 2017 Cash Income, Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow generation.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Income are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly named, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect the underlying performance of the ongoing operations of the Company and provide investors with a view of the Company's operations from management's perspective. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income remove significant restructuring, non-operational, or certain non-cash items from earnings. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income to monitor and evaluate the operating performance of the Company and as the basis to set and measure progress toward performance targets. Further, the Cash Income measure directly affects compensation for employees and executives. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP measures as measures of operating performance and not as measures of the Company's liquidity. The Company's presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual, non-operational, or non-cash items.

ABCD,"DALLAS, Aug 31, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Gilmer County (Ga.) High School graduation rates for students with disabilities have skyrocketed more than 46 percent in the past four years, and officials point directly to the district's implementation of a reading remediation initiative--REWARDSfrom Voyager Sopris Learning. Moreover, district officials report student engagement is also at a new high level as the program is not only helping students learn to read, it is breaking the generational cycle of illiteracy in this rural community at the foot of the Appalachian Mountains. Since the 2012-13 school year when REWARDS was implemented, graduation rates have soared from 40 percent to 86.1 percent in the 2015-16 school year. ""Students who had previously abandoned any expectation for learning are now experiencing success, often for the very first time,"" says Diane Vautrot, Special Education Coordinator, Gilmer County Charter School System. ""Before REWARDS, too many students had honestly given up,"" Vautrot said. ""They came to school for socialization or to be fed, but most had no hope of graduating."" Six years ago, many students with disabilities entering high school at GCCSS were reading at the pre-primer to second-grade level. Many failed to master basic reading skills sufficiently to graduate. In response, administrators at GCCSS collaborated with the Graduate First Dropout Prevention program and North Central Georgia Learning Resource System (GLRS) opted to implement REWARDS. The results were remarkable from the start, noted Vautrot, who is known in the district and throughout the county as the ""local literacy champion."" ""In conjunction with intensive individualized interventions and a staff of teachers and administrators that would simply not accept failure as an option, our students are succeeding with the REWARDS program,"" she said. ""After years of failure trying to learn to read with phonics and sight words, students are building the confidence to try again. ""The REWARDS program has increased reading grade levels across the board and given students the skills to read their core content textbooks and to write effectively--skills they need to succeed. Students are graduating with their class and going on to post-secondary training and education."" ""We applaud Diane Vautrot and her tenacious team at Gilmer County Charter Schools for tackling this situation head-on and succeeding beyond anyone's wildest imagination,"" said Jeffrey A. Elliott, President, Voyager Sopris Learning. ""The benefits of this work will last a lifetime."" With the high school reporting rapid grade-level growth, REWARDS has since been implemented in both middle schools and now is taught by every special education literacy teacher and ESOL teacher in GCCSS's two middle schools and the high school. ""We implemented the REWARDS Plus science program in seventh grade and have found it to be a perfect way to merge teaching science vocabulary and state content standards while reinforcing the REWARDS reading strategies,"" Vautrot noted. In addition, the district plans to soon implement the program in seventh-grade general education language arts classes to bring all students up to grade-level performance. ""Successful reading intervention at the middle and high school level is not only possible, it's desperately needed and life changing,"" Vautrot said. ""We are proud, but mostly we're happy to impact the lives of our students in this way.""

GAAP net revenues by segment for the six months ended June 30, 2017, and the change from the same period of 2016, were as follows:  Learning A-Z [(R)] - $36.8 million, increased $5.2 million or 17%  ExploreLearning [(R)] - $13.5 million, increased $2.2 million or 19%  Voyager Sopris Learning [(R)] - $26.0 million, decreased $(3.8) million or (13)%.  Bookings for the first half of 2017 decreased by (8)% to $48.9 million compared with $52.9 million in the first half of 2016, with strong growth at the Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning segments offset by a decline in the Voyager Sopris Learning segment.  Technology-enabled Bookings represented 71% of total first half 2017 Bookings compared with 62% of first half 2016 Bookings. Technology-enabled Bookings for the first six months ended June 30, 2017 grew 6% compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016.  The Company reported net income of $8.3 million during the first half of 2017, increasing $4.7 million compared to net income of $3.7 million during the first half of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $21.9 million, increasing $3.9 million from $18.0 million in 2016. The increase in GAAP net revenues, along with a greater portion of the top-line mix coming from the high margin Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning segments, drove improvement in both net income and Adjusted EBITDA.  Net interest expense was $2.6 million for the first half of 2017, down $1.2 million from the first half of 2016 as a result of the scheduled debt amortization payments and voluntary prepayments made during 2016.  Cash Income was $(11.6) million, compared to $(10.4) million reported in the first half of 2016. A shift in timing of Bookings to the latter part of the year resulted in a decrease to Cash Income, which is a highly seasonal metric and historically in a loss position for the first half of the year. Capital expenditures totaled $8.8 million in the first half of 2017 versus $10.8 million in the first half of 2016.  The Company had cash and cash equivalents of $4.6 million at June 30, 2017. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, cash used in operations was $4.3 million, cash used in investing activities was $8.8 million, and cash provided by financing activities was $12.8 million. At June 30, 2017, the principal amount of term loans outstanding was $72.7 million, the revolving credit facility outstanding was $16.0 million and there was $13.8 million available under the revolving credit facility. Second Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights GAAP net revenues for the second quarter of 2017 increased by $1.3 million, or 3%, to $40.4 million compared with $39.1 million in 2016. GAAP net revenues by segment for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and the change from the same period of 2016, were as follows:  Learning A-Z - $18.7 million, increased $2.8 million or 17%  ExploreLearning - $6.7 million, increased $1.0 million or 17%  Voyager Sopris Learning - $15.0 million, decreased $(2.5) million or (14)%.  Bookings for the second quarter of 2017 were $29.7 million, lower by (6)% compared with $31.6 million in the second quarter of 2016.  The Company reported a net income of $5.8 million during the second quarter of 2017, increasing $2.0 million compared to net income of $3.8 million during the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.9 million, increasing $1.3 million from $11.6 million in 2016. The increase in GAAP net revenues, along with a greater portion of the top-line mix coming from the high margin Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning segments, drove improvement in both net income and Adjusted EBITDA.  Cash Income was $(0.8) million for the second quarter of 2017 compared to Cash Income of $0.4 million for the second quarter of 2016. A shift in timing of Bookings to the latter part of the year resulted in a decrease to Cash Income, which is a highly seasonal metric. Capital expenditures totaled $4.3 million in the second quarter of 2017 versus $5.8 million in the second quarter of 2016. Second Quarter 2017 Segment Discussion Net Revenues, Bookings, Net Income and Cash Income changes by segment for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period of 2016 were:   Q2 - 2017 % Change   YTD - 2017 % Change   Net Revenues Bookings Net Income Cash Income   Net Revenues Bookings Net Income Cash Income Learning A-Z 17 % (2 )% 18 % (53 )%   17 % 8 % 15 % (79 )% ExploreLearning 17 % 24 % 23 % 97 %   19 % 19 % 34 % 45 % Voyager Sopris Learning (14 )% (19 )% (23 )% (106 )%   (13 )% (27 )% (8 )% (38 )% Shared Services         9 % 21 %           6 % 14 % Cambium Learning Group, Inc. 3 % (6 )% 54 % (293 )%   5 % (8 )% 127 % (12 )% 2017 Outlook Mr. Campbell concluded, ""With the sales pipeline strengthening in the seasonal back-to-school selling period, we are reaffirming our Bookings outlook for both Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning. Voyager Sopris Learning has started to pick up momentum in the third quarter, but given the slow start in the first half, we expect Bookings to fall in the lower range of our original full-year outlook for this segment. We are on track to achieve our company-wide full-year goals and look forward to helping students meet their full potential in the upcoming school year. In sum, we are executing well on our 2017 plan to achieve full-year accelerated top-line growth, expanded Cash Income profitability and higher cash flow generation. Cambium Learning's mission is to leverage technology to create solutions that are personalized, adaptive, scalable, and designed to achieve results in the classroom. We are poised to deliver strong results in 2017."" The Company expects 2017 company-wide Bookings growth to be in a range from 6% to low double-digit percentage growth, with most of the growth expected in the second half of the year during the Company's seasonally strong periods. Management continues to expect Bookings from higher-margin technology-enabled solutions to approach 80% of total Company volume, with strong Bookings growth of at least 15% for Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning. The Voyager Sopris Learning segment is expected to significantly slow its top-line decline in 2017 as its strategic growth products gain traction and legacy products become a smaller part of the mix, with Bookings expected to likely decline between five and ten percent. Cambium Learning Group's business is highly seasonal, with Bookings historically peaking during the third quarter, which represents by far the preponderance of Bookings, revenue and income each year. The Company expects 2017 capital expenditures for product development to be roughly consistent with the $17.3 million expended in 2016 and 2017 general capital expenditures to be roughly consistent with the $2.7 million expended in 2016. Consistent with its historical seasonal pattern, the Company expects Cash Income to become cumulatively positive in the third quarter and for the full-year 2017 Cash Income margin to grow between one and three percentage points compared to 2016, depending on top-line growth. The Company expects its 2017 Adjusted EBITDA margin to be roughly consistent with 2016. Company-wide top-line growth, coupled with continued careful expense management, is expected to drive expansion in 2017 Cash Income, Adjusted EBITDA and cash flow generation. Cambium Learning Group will continue to refine its outlook as the year progresses to the more seasonably significant quarters.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Income are not prepared in accordance with GAAP and may be different from similarly named, non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes these non-GAAP measures provide useful information to investors because they reflect the underlying performance of the ongoing operations of the Company and provide investors with a view of the Company's operations from management's perspective. Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income remove significant restructuring, non-operational, or certain non-cash items from earnings. The Company uses Adjusted EBITDA and Cash Income to monitor and evaluate the operating performance of the Company and as the basis to set and measure progress toward performance targets. Further, the Cash Income measure directly affects compensation for employees and executives. The Company generally uses these non-GAAP measures as measures of operating performance and not as measures of the Company's liquidity. The Company's presentation of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA, and Cash Income should not be construed as an indication that our future results will be unaffected by unusual, non-operational, or non-cash items.
