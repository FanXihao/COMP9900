OCFC,"Some investors are trimming their stock holdings out of concern for rising inflation and higher interest rates. But some sectors, most notably smaller banks, may benefit from higher rates. The Hennessy Small-Cap Financial Fund’s 38 holdings of mostly community and regional banks are asset sensitive. This means their balance sheets are positioned so that their loans and investments reprice faster than their deposits and borrowings do. In other words, as interest rates rise, the spread the banks earn between what they lend and what they borrow expands and their net interest margins widen. The fund was established in January 1997 and has about $200 million in assets. Hennessy Funds is based in Novato, Calif., and has about $6.8 billion in assets under management. In an interview, David Ellison and Ryan Kelley, the fund’s portfolio managers, explained that the fund has been positioned in “traditional banks” for many years. “The value-add here is you have a stable funding source,” Ellison said. These banks rely heavily on what industry players call “core” or “sticky” deposits — checking accounts and savings accounts — rather than on the wholesale funding that caused many large banks and even nonbank lenders such as General Electric Corp. GE, -2.11%  to face liquidity crises in 2008. Ellison and Kelley focus on buying shares of banks that “invest in loans appropriately and have a decent expense culture,” Ellison said. “The goal is to buy these companies so that if you hold them for a number of years, your performance will be better than the market,” he said. Hennessy Funds. David Ellison, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds. The fund’s “Investor” class shares have a four-star ranking (out of five) from Morningstar. Here are returns for the fund’s two share classes compared with those of the Russell 2000 Index and the Russell 2000 Financial Services Index: Total return — 2018 through Feb. 21 Average annual return — 3 years Avg. return — 5 years Avg. return — 10 years Avg. return — 15 years Hennessy Small Cap Financial Fund — Investor Shares HSFNX, -0.08%   3.2% 15.1% 13.4% 9.9% 9.1% Hennessy Small Cap Financial Fund — Institutional Shares HISFX, -0.07%   3.3% 15.6% 13.9% N/A N/A Russell 2000 Index RUT, -1.74% -0.1% 9.1% 12.6% 9.7% 11.5% Russell 2000 Financial Services Index -1.3% 11.3% 12.9% 8.3% 9.1% Source: Morningstar Direct The return figures are after expenses. For the periods named, the fund’s two share classes have outperformed the Russel 2000 Financial Services Index, while outperforming the entire Russell 2000 for all periods except 15 years. ‘Credit culture’ “The biggest determinant for these companies, both short term and long term, is the credit culture,” Ellison said. Determining which banks are making prudent lending decisions involves not only crunching the numbers but having conversations with bank management, he added. When surveying current market conditions, Kelley said things were playing out pretty much as he and Ellison expected after President Trump was elected in November 2016. This includes some margin improvement from increasing mortgage loan rates. But there is a major challenge for the entire U.S. banking industry: “The credit line utilization is low and there are a lot of loan payoffs. This tells me the companies are in positions to do that, which means they are in better shape than you think. It is hard to make loans when small business do not want to lever up because they did so last time,” he said. Hennessy Funds. Ryan Kelley, portfolio manager at Hennessy Funds. And it’s not only companies that learned the lessons of being overleveraged — individuals are also wary of borrowing too much, Kelley said. Despite the slow loan growth, he remains upbeat for the industry, he said, because the strong credit trends seem likely to continue. Stock selection and holdings Ellison said the fund’s stock picks could be placed in four buckets: • Good returns on assets and equity, with solid credit quality and growing market share. Brookline Bancorp BRKL, -1.70%  of Boston is an example in this category, Ellison said. It was the fund’s fourth-largest holding as of Dec. 31. • Credit going from bad to good — a play on value as a bank fixes a credit quality problem and improves its profitability. • A change of management that hopefully leads to vastly improved performance. • M&A — takeout targets or banks with good track records for making acquisitions at reasonable prices and integrating them efficiently. Kelley named Banc of California Inc. BANC, -1.04%  as an example of a bank that fits in the second or third category, as very rapid expansion led to problems with asset quality and a change in management. The bank has “worked through a good amount” of its problem loans and repossessed assets, Kelley said. Banc of California’s stock now trades for 22.9 times the bank’s consensus 2018 earnings estimate, among analysts polled by FactSet. “But if they are able to execute and lower expenses and focus on profitability, they will be closer to 13 times earnings for next year,” Kelley said. This is a good example of the fund’s long-term strategy that includes “opportunities along the edges,” he said. Here are the fund’s top 10 equity holdings as of Dec. 31: Bank or holding company Ticker City Share of portfolio Price/ consensus 2018 EPS estimate Price/ consensus 2019 EPS estimate Hingham Institution for Savings HIFS, +0.11%   Hingham, Mass. 4.9% N/A N/A Opus Bank OPB, +0.00% Irvine, Calif. 4.8% 17.6 14.2 Banc of California Inc.

OCFC,"TOMS RIVER, N.J., Feb 05, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OceanFirst Financial Corp. (""OceanFirst"") OCFC, -1.61% today announced the final election results made by the shareholders of Sun Bancorp, Inc. (""Sun"") regarding the form of consideration they wish to receive in connection with OceanFirst's acquisition of Sun (the ""Elections""). As previously announced, OceanFirst completed its acquisition of Sun on January 31, 2018. Under the definitive agreement, each former Sun shareholder had the right to elect to receive per share consideration of either (i) $24.99 in cash or (ii) 0.9289 shares of OceanFirst common stock (with cash paid in lieu of fractional OceanFirst shares). The value of the per share consideration was determined by adding $21.21 (the product of 0.7884 and $26.9058, the volume-weighted average trading price of OceanFirst common stock on the NASDAQ for the five trading day period ending on the last trading day preceding January 31, 2018) and $3.78. The aggregate amount of available cash consideration in the transaction is $72,366,671.16, and the total number of Sun shares entitled to receive the cash consideration is 2,895,825. The final Election results are as follows: 8,435,982 Sun shares elected to receive the cash consideration. These Sun shares are referred to as the cash election shares. 9,778,170 Sun shares elected to receive the stock consideration. These Sun shares are referred to as the stock election shares. 930,470 Sun shares did not elect to receive a form of merger consideration. These Sun shares are referred to as the non-election shares. The Elections are subject to the allocation and proration procedures set forth in the definitive agreement. Based on the final Election results, the cash consideration was oversubscribed. The available cash consideration will be allocated on a pro rata basis among all of the holders of cash election shares. Accordingly, 34% of each holder's cash election shares was converted into the right to receive the cash consideration, and the remaining 66% of such holder's cash election shares was converted into the right to receive the stock consideration. All of the stock election shares and all of the non-election shares were converted into the right to receive the stock consideration. It is expected that the exchange agent for the transmission of the merger consideration will mail a letter of transmittal to each former Sun shareholder of record by February 7, 2018.

The Election Deadline is based on OceanFirst's and Sun's current expectation that the proposed merger transaction (the ""Transaction"") will be completed on January 31, 2018, as previously disclosed.

Each Sun Holder should have received a copy of the Election Form. The election materials do not provide for a guaranteed delivery procedure. Sun Holders bear the risk of ensuring proper and timely delivery of their election materials.

OCFC,"TOMS RIVER, N.J., Oct 26, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OceanFirst Financial Corp. OCFC, -1.91% (the ""Company""), the holding company for OceanFirst Bank (the ""Bank""), today announced that diluted earnings per share were $0.39 for the three months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to $0.35 for the corresponding prior year period. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, diluted earnings per share were $0.98, as compared to $0.77 for the prior corresponding year period. The results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 include merger related expenses and branch consolidation expenses and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 also include the acceleration of stock award expense due to the retirement of a director. These items decreased net income, net of tax benefit, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, by $2.1 million and $8.8 million, respectively. Excluding these items, core earnings for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $14.9 million, or $0.45 per diluted share, and $41.3 million, or $1.25 per diluted share, respectively. (Please refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation table at the end of this document for details on the earnings impact of merger related expenses, branch consolidation expenses, certain other incurred expenses and quantification of core earnings). Highlights for the quarter are described below: The Company achieved record quarterly core earnings and diluted earnings per share of $14.9 million and $0.45, respectively. The Company grew deposits $173.4 million, reducing its loan to deposit ratio to 89.0%, while the cost of deposits increased only one basis point from the prior linked quarter, to 0.29%. Asset quality improved as non-performing loans decreased to $15.1 million, and non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 0.39%. ""The Company delivered very strong results for the quarter with record earnings and core diluted earnings per share increasing 12.5% over the prior year quarter,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Christopher D. Maher. Mr. Maher added, ""We are pleased to report solid deposit growth which reflects organic growth as well as retention and expansion of relationships with depositors who have joined OceanFirst from the completed acquisitions. The Company continues to focus on credit quality and realizing expense reductions from merger efficiencies and branch consolidations.""

(""Sun"") SNBC On October 24 and 25, 2017, Sun and the Company received their respective requisite stockholder approvals for the merger. Regulatory approval of the merger was received from the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia on October 17, 2017. The regulatory application for the transaction remains under review by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (""OCC""). Subject to receipt of OCC approval and other customary closing conditions, the Company expects to close the transaction in January 2018 and anticipates full integration of Sun's branches and core operating systems in the second quarter of 2018. The Company also announced that the Company's Board of Directors declared its eighty-third consecutive quarterly cash dividend on common stock. The dividend, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, of $0.15 per share will be paid on November 17, 2017 to stockholders of record on November 6, 2017. Results of Operations On May 2, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Cape Bancorp, Inc. (""Cape"") and its results of operations are included in the consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, but are excluded from the results of operations for the period from January 1, 2016 to May 1, 2016. On November 30, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Ocean Shore Holding Company (""Ocean Shore"") and its results of operations are included in the consolidated results for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, but are excluded from the results of operations for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net income for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, was $12.8 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, as compared to $9.1 million, or $0.35 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year period. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $32.5 million, or $0.98 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $17.0 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year period. Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, includes merger related and branch consolidation expenses and for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, also includes the acceleration of stock award expense due to the retirement of a director. These items decreased net income, net of tax benefit, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, by $2.1 million and $8.8 million, respectively. Net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016 includes merger related expenses of $1.3 million and $9.9 million, respectively. Excluding these items, net income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 increased over the prior year periods primarily due to the acquisitions of Cape and Ocean Shore (""Acquisition Transactions""). In addition, in the first quarter of 2017 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-09 ""Compensation - Stock Compensation"" which resulted in decreases in income tax expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, of $158,000 and $1.7 million, respectively. Net interest income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased to $43.1 million and $126.7 million, respectively, as compared to $33.9 million and $84.5 million, respectively, for the same prior year periods, reflecting an increase in interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets increased $1.086 billion and $1.574 billion, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the same prior year periods. The averages for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, were favorably impacted by the interest-earning assets acquired in the Acquisition Transactions. The net interest margin for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 decreased to 3.50% and increased to 3.54%, respectively, from 3.56% and 3.51%, respectively, for the same prior year periods. The yields on average interest-earning assets decreased to 3.91% and increased to 3.93%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, from 3.92% and 3.88%, respectively, for the same prior year periods. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.50% and 0.49%, respectively, from 0.43% and 0.46%, respectively, in the corresponding prior year periods. The total cost of deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) was 0.29% and 0.28%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to 0.25% for both the three and nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased $882,000, as compared to the prior linked quarter, as average interest-earning assets increased $131.8 million. The net interest margin decreased to 3.50% for the three months ended September 30, 2017, from 3.57% for the prior linked quarter. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the provision for loan losses was $1.2 million and $3.0 million, respectively, as compared to $888,000 and $2.1 million, respectively, for the corresponding prior year periods, and remained unchanged at $1.2 million when compared to the prior linked quarter. Net loan charge-offs were $1.1 million and $1.6 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to net loan charge-offs of $1.9 million and $3.2 million, respectively, in the corresponding prior year periods, and $759,000 in the prior linked quarter. Non-performing loans totaled $15.1 million at September 30, 2017, as compared to $16.3 million at June 30, 2017, and $16.5 million at September 30, 2016. The decrease in non-performing loans from the prior linked quarter was partly due to the sale of non-performing residential loans totaling $3.5 million partially offset by the addition of one non-performing commercial loan totaling $3.2 million. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, other income increased to $7.4 million and $20.3 million, respectively, as compared to $5.9 million and $14.2 million, respectively, for the corresponding prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition Transactions, which added $1.1 million and $4.9 million, respectively, to other income for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the same prior year periods. Excluding the Acquisition Transactions, the remaining increase in other income for the three months ended September 30, 2017, was primarily due to higher deposit and bank card related fees of $272,000 and $71,000, respectively, as compared to the same prior year period. In addition, income from other real estate operations, excluding the Acquisition Transactions, increased $364,000 which was offset by a decrease in the net gain on the sale of loans available for sale (included in other income) of $360,000. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, excluding the Acquisition Transactions, the increase in other income was primarily due to higher deposit and bank card related fees of $1.0 million and $153,000, respectively, as compared to the same prior year period. Excluding the Acquisition Transactions, an increase in income from other real estate operations of $609,000 was offset by a decrease in the net gain on the sale of loans (included in other income) of $697,000. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, other income increased $386,000, as compared to the prior linked quarter. The increase in other income over the prior linked quarter was primarily due to an increase in the net gain from other real estate operations of $327,000. Operating expenses increased to $30.7 million and $98.8 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to $25.0 million and $70.4 million, respectively, in the same prior year periods. Operating expenses for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, included $3.2 million and $13.2 million, respectively, of merger related and branch consolidation expenses, as compared to $1.3 million and $9.9 million, respectively, in the prior year periods. Excluding the impact of merger and branch consolidation expenses, the increase in operating expenses over the prior year was primarily due to the Acquisition Transactions, which added $2.4 million and $18.9 million for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, excluding the Acquisition Transaction expenses, there were increases in marketing expense and loan related expenses. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, excluding the Acquisition Transaction expenses, there were increases in compensation and employee benefits expense, equipment expense, marketing expense and professional fees. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, operating expenses, excluding merger and branch consolidation expenses, decreased $947,000, as compared to the prior linked quarter, primarily due to the closing of 15 branches in mid May and early July. The provision for income taxes was $5.7 million and $12.7 million, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to $4.8 million and $9.2 million, respectively, for the same prior year periods. The effective tax rate was 30.8% and 28.0%, respectively, for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to 34.4% and 35.0%, respectively, for the same prior year periods. The lower effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 resulted from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which decreased income tax expense by $158,000 and $1.7 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09, the effective tax rate would have been 31.6% and 31.8% for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, respectively. Under the ASU, the tax benefits of exercised stock options and vested stock awards are recognized as a benefit to income tax expense in the reporting period in which they occur. The tax benefit relating to the Company's stock plans was $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was recorded directly into stockholders equity. The elevated tax benefit for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, was related to the exercise of options assumed in the acquisition of Cape and Ocean Shore and the increase in the Company's stock price. Excluding the tax benefit of exercised stock options and vested stock awards, the lower effective tax rate for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, as compared to the same prior year periods, was primarily due to the deductibility of merger related expenses and an increase in tax exempt income. Financial Condition Total assets increased by $216.9 million to $5.384 billion at September 30, 2017, from $5.167 billion at December 31, 2016. Cash and due from banks decreased by $46.1 million, to $255.3 million at September 30, 2017, from $301.4 million at December 31, 2016, as these funds were deployed into higher-yielding securities which increased $199.1 million. Loans receivable, net, increased by $66.7 million, to $3.870 billion at September 30, 2017 from $3.803 billion at December 31, 2016. Premises and equipment decreased $7.0 million at September 30, 2017, as compared to December 31, 2016, due to the consolidation of 15 branches during the nine months ended September 30, 2017. The premises and equipment at these locations were written down to their net realizable value and the remaining balance was reclassified to assets held for sale. Deposits increased by $162.5 million, to $4.350 billion at September 30, 2017, from $4.188 billion at December 31, 2016. The loan-to-deposit ratio at September 30, 2017 was 89.0%, as compared to 90.8% at December 31, 2016. Stockholders' equity increased to $596.3 million at September 30, 2017, as compared to $572.0 million at December 31, 2016. At September 30, 2017, there were 1.8 million shares available for repurchase under the Company's stock repurchase programs. In the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company did not repurchase any shares under these repurchase programs. Tangible stockholders' equity per common share increased to $13.47 at September 30, 2017, as compared to $12.95 at December 31, 2016. Asset Quality The Company's non-performing loans increased to $15.1 million at September 30, 2017, as compared to $13.6 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to the addition of two commercial real estate relationships totaling $7.4 million, partially offset by the payoff of two non-performing loans totaling $1.7 million. An increase in non-performing residential mortgage loans in the first quarter of 2017 was largely offset by the bulk sale of non-performing residential loans in the second quarter of 2017. The decrease in non-performing residential loans in the third quarter of 2017 was due to a bulk sale of $3.5 million in non-performing residential loans. Non-performing loans do not include $4.9 million of purchased credit-impaired (""PCI"") loans acquired in the Acquisition Transactions. The Company's other real estate owned totaled $9.3 million at September 30, 2017, as compared to $9.8 million at December 31, 2016. At September 30, 2017, the Company's allowance for loan losses was 0.42% of total loans, an increase from 0.40% at December 31, 2016. These ratios exclude existing fair value credit marks of $19.8 million and $26.0 million at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, on the Ocean Shore, Cape and Colonial American Bank loans. These loans were acquired at fair value with no related allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total non-performing loans was 109.68% at September 30, 2017 as compared to 111.92% at December 31, 2016. Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reported amounts are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). The Company's management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information, which consists of reported net income excluding merger related expenses, branch consolidation expenses, and accelerated stock award expense relating to a director retirement, which can vary from period to period, provides a better comparison of period to period operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company's financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies. Please refer to Non-GAAP Reconciliation table at the end of this document for details on the earnings impact of these items.

OCFC,"MOUNT LAUREL, N.J., Oct. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Third Quarter Highlights: Third quarter 2017 net income of $2.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, in second quarter of 2017. Return on average assets expands to 0.50% from 0.27% in linked prior quarter; Efficiency ratio improves to 77% from 91% in linked prior quarter. Net interest margin increased by 29 basis points to 3.25% in the third quarter of 2017 as compared to 2.96% for the second quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of increasing loan yield with stable cost of deposits as well as the redemption of approximately $40 million of high-cost holding company debt during June and July of 2017.  Cost of deposits fell one basis point from the prior quarter to 0.39%.  Quarterly operating expenses fell to $14.5 million in the third quarter, as compared to $16.3 million in the linked prior quarter; representing the lowest quarterly expenses since 2002. Continuation of solid asset quality trends with non-performing loans of $4.2 million at September 30, 2017, which is 0.26% of gross loans. No provision for loan loss was recorded, and net charge-offs were $250 thousand in the third quarter. Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.01 per share to holders of record of the common stock of Sun Bancorp, Inc. as of November 21, 2017, payable on December 5, 2017. Sun Bancorp, Inc. SNBC (the ""Company""), the holding company for Sun National Bank (the ""Bank""), today reported net income of $2.7 million, or $0.14 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, compared to net income of $1.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, and net income of $1.6 million, or $0.09 per diluted share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. ""Our successful efforts in the last three years towards strengthening capital, building profitability and controlling expenses continue to produce financial results of better quality and quantity. Several of our financial ratios are now at or well above peer levels,"" stated President & CEO Thomas M. O'Brien.  ""Entering 2017, the Company stated that it would continue to focus on improving net interest margin, the efficiency ratio and return on assets, and the third quarter demonstrated significant milestone achievements towards those goals.  Despite slowdowns in new business development, the underlying health and strength of the Company is further evidenced by the significant increase in our diluted earnings per share from $0.08 to $0.14.""   Discussion of Results: Balance Sheet Total assets decreased to $2.17 billion at September 30, 2017, as compared to $2.22 billion at June 30, 2017 and $2.26 billion at December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $93.5 million at September 30, 2017, as compared to $127.8 million at June 30, 2017 and $134.2 million at December 31, 2016.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the first nine months of 2017 was primarily due to a reduction in brokered and subscription deposits and the recent redemptions of approximately $40 million of trust preferred securities, partially offset by decreases in net loans receivable and investment securities since December 31, 2016. Investment securities decreased by $11.6 million to $288.4 million at September 30, 2017 from $300.0 million at June 30, 2017 due to pay downs.  The Bank did not initiate new investment purchases in the current quarter as available cash flow was reinvested into commercial loans. Net loans totaled $1.57 billion at each of September 30, 2017 and June 30, 2017 as compared to $1.59 billion at December 31, 2016.  The decrease of $19.9 million since year end was due to several factors.  As a result of the reduction in originations and refinancing activity, non-owner occupied commercial real estate (""CRE"") loans fell by $29.0 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017.  Residential and home equity loans declined by $37.7 million over the same period as the Bank's position in these portfolios continued to decline with no origination activity.  Offsetting these decreases was growth in the commercial and industrial (C&I) lending segment, which includes owner-occupied CRE loans and C&I loans, of $33.2 million and an increase in land and development loans of $12.6 million in the nine months ended September 30, 2017. ""In the past two quarters, we believe several of the Bank's non-owner occupied CRE clients have scaled back on activity, due to potential U.S. tax reform legislative proposals that may have a material impact on the economics of real estate investments,"" stated O'Brien.  ""As projected, our C&I activity remained robust as the Bank continues to evaluate attractive relationship lending opportunities in this segment."" Total deposits decreased to $1.68 billion at September 30, 2017, as compared to $1.71 billion at June 30, 2017 and $1.74 billion at December 31, 2016 due primarily to a $66 million, or 68%, runoff in brokered and subscription deposits since year-end 2016.  The cost of deposits decreased by one basis point to 39 basis points compared to the prior linked quarter and increased by five basis points as compared to the nine months ended September 30, 2016. ""The Bank's slower loan originations as well as our liquidity position affords us the opportunity to continue to shed non-relationship brokered and subscription deposits and better focus on fee-generating relationship deposits,"" stated O'Brien.  ""As a result, we saw a small decrease in overall cost of deposits despite the increasing external competitive rate environment."" Net Interest Income and Margin Net interest income was $16.0 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared to $14.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, and $14.7 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. The Company's net interest margin was 3.25% for the three months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to 2.96% for three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2.94% for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The increase in net interest margin in the third quarter of 2017 primarily reflects an increase in loan yields of 16 basis points from the linked prior quarter and the impact of the recent trust preferred redemptions while deposit cost of funds fell by one basis point.  During the second quarter, the Bank accelerated $415 thousand of deferred issuance costs related to two tranches of trust preferred securities, totaling $40 million, which were fully redeemed during June and July of 2017.  This acceleration of costs reduced net interest margin by nine basis points in the second quarter of 2017.  ""Coming into 2017, the Company had stated that its net interest margin target would be between 3.00% and 3.10%,"" said O'Brien.  ""In 2017, we effectively de-leveraged our balance sheet in order to redeem approximately $40 million of our trust preferred securities.  Coupled with the improved yield on our loan portfolio and stable deposit costs, the Company was able to expand its margin by 29 basis points to 3.25% for the third quarter of 2017 compared to the prior year quarter, which is now in line with peer levels.  Over the last three years, the Company has been mindful of the asset-sensitive nature of its balance sheet, which we believe has positioned us well in a rising rate environment."" Non-Interest Income Non-interest income was $2.8 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, as compared to $3.0 million and $3.1 million for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, respectively.  The decrease in non-interest income from the quarter ended June 30, 2017 reflects declines in both deposit related fees and investment products income resulting from mild reductions in fee paying customers.. Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2017 was $14.5 million as compared to $16.3 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and $15.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016.  The decrease in non-interest expense from the prior linked quarter is due primarily to decreases of $1.0 million in other expenses and $491 thousand in professional fees.  Other expenses included $588 thousand of recourse reserve reversals in the third quarter of 2017 and $166 thousand of lower appraisal fees compared to the linked prior quarter.  Professional fees declined primarily due to the linked prior quarter including $400 thousand of merger related expenses.  Non-interest expense for the third quarter of 2017 declined by $1.4 million compared to the third quarter of 2016, primarily due to the aforementioned recourse reserve reversals, a decrease of $233 thousand in equipment expense, a decrease of $132 thousand in occupancy expense, a decrease of $124 thousand in data processing expense, a $106 thousand decline in advertising expense and a $105 thousand decrease in professional fees. ""With our quarterly non-interest expenses now falling below $15 million, we continue to demonstrate our careful attention to cost management principles,"" said O'Brien.  ""Rationalization of occupancy costs, reduction of expenses as a result of diligent risk management, information technology platform enhancements and strong vendor management are all contributing factors that have allowed the Company to improve its operating efficiency.  At the beginning of 2017, we stated that improving the efficiency ratio would be a key objective.  Our efforts have led to a significant improvement in that metric.  The Company's efficiency ratio, which had hovered above 90% in recent quarters, improved to 77% this quarter."" Asset Quality Non-performing loans decreased by $228 thousand to $4.2 million, or 0.26% of gross loans, at September 30, 2017 from $4.4 million, or 0.28% of gross loans, at June 30, 2017. During the third quarter of 2017, approximately $1.0 million of non-performing residential mortgage loans were sold.  This was offset by an increase in non-performing residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans of approximately $500 thousand and $300 thousand, respectively. Non-performing loans were $6.8 million, or 0.42% of gross loans, at September 30, 2016. There was no provision for loan losses recorded in the three months ended September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016.  The Bank's credit portfolio has remained relatively steady with minimal charge-off activity.  While net charge-offs for the third quarter of 2017 were $250 thousand, in the first nine months of 2017 the Bank recorded net charge-offs of $16 thousand as compared to net charge-offs of $499 thousand in the first nine months of 2016.  The allowance for loan losses was $14.7 million, or 0.92% of gross loans, at September 30, 2017 as compared to $14.9 million, or 0.94% of gross loans, at June 30, 2017 and $15.8 million, or 1.01% of gross loans, at September 30, 2016.  The allowance for loan losses was 349% of non-performing loans at September 30, 2017 as compared to 337% of non-performing loans at June 30, 2017 and 238% of non-performing loans at September 30, 2016. Capital The Company's capital ratios continue to remain very strong due to positive earnings and a slightly reduced balance sheet.  All capital ratios remain at robust levels and are sufficient to support the Company's strategic plan.  At September 30, 2017, the Bank had a Tier 1 common equity risk-based capital ratio of 18.7%, total risk-based capital ratio of 19.6%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 18.7% and a leverage capital ratio of 14.2%. At September 30, 2017, the Company's Tier 1 common equity risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and leverage capital ratio were 16.5%, 20.2%, 19.2%, and 14.6%, respectively.  The Company's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 13.6% at September 30, 2017, as compared to 13.2% at June 30, 2017 and 10.6% at September 30, 2016.  Merger Update On October 24, 2017, the Sun Bancorp, Inc. shareholders approved the previously announced merger of the Company with and into OceanFirst Financial Corp. OCFC, -1.91% (""OceanFirst"") with OceanFirst as the surviving entity (the ""Merger"").

Dividend Declaration On October 24, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of $0.01 per share to holders of record of the common stock of the Company as of November 21, 2017, payable on December 5, 2017.

""The accomplishments of this quarter and the merger announcement of the previous quarter, further demonstrate that commitment.  We believe our Company has made tremendous progress in the last three years towards building profitability, pristine asset quality and a culture of regulatory excellence and delivering upon the promise of solid relationship banking.  The additional progress we have achieved in the third quarter is a culmination of those efforts, and represents an impressive legacy for Sun and all of its various stakeholders.""

OCFC,"TOMS RIVER, N.J., Jul 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- OceanFirst Financial Corp. OCFC, -1.68% (the ""Company""), the holding company for OceanFirst Bank (the ""Bank""), today announced that diluted earnings per share were $0.23 for the three months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $0.16 for the corresponding prior year period. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, diluted earnings per share were $0.59, as compared to $0.39 for the prior corresponding year period. The results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 include merger related expenses and branch consolidation expenses and for the six months ended June 30, 2017 also include the acceleration of stock award expense from a director retirement. These items decreased net income, net of tax benefit, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, by $5.6 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Excluding these items, core earnings for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 were $13.3 million, or $0.40 per diluted share, and $26.4 million, or $0.80 per diluted share, respectively. (Please refer to the Non-GAAP Reconciliation table at the end of this document for details on the earnings impact of merger related expenses, branch consolidation expenses, certain other incurred expenses and quantification of core earnings). Highlights for the quarter are described below: Total loans grew $47.5 million, including $26.6 million in consumer loan growth and $20.9 million in commercial loan growth, while asset quality improved as non-performing loans decreased $5.4 million, or 25.0%, to $16.3 million, and non-performing loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to 0.42%, as compared to 0.56% in the prior linked quarter. The Company maintained a loan to deposit ratio of 92.6% while cost of deposits increased one basis point from the prior linked quarter to 0.28%. The Company successfully completed the consolidation of 15 branches throughout central and southern New Jersey, with total expected annualized cost savings of $6.1 million. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Christopher D. Maher, commented on the Company's results, ""We are pleased with the accelerated loan growth achieved this quarter and to have completed the full integration of Ocean City Home Bank which will result in material expense reductions in the coming quarters. The systems integration of Ocean City Home Bank in May and the additional branch rationalization completed in July resulted in the consolidation of 15 branches."" Mr. Maher added, ""On June 30, 2017, we announced our plans to acquire Sun Bancorp, Inc. (""Sun""). The Sun transaction provides a wonderful opportunity to enhance the OceanFirst franchise and continue our strategic growth plans. It is subject to regulatory and stockholder approvals which are not expected until the first quarter of 2018. As part of the transaction we are considering making application to convert to a bank holding company which would operate OceanFirst as a national bank."" The Company also announced that the Company's Board of Directors declared its eighty-second consecutive quarterly cash dividend on common stock. The dividend for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 of $0.15 per share will be paid on August 18, 2017 to stockholders of record on August 7, 2017. The Company continues to focus on actively managing expense levels. Expense reductions associated with the successful systems integration of Ocean Shore Holding Company (""Ocean Shore"") in the second quarter of 2017 will be fully realized in the third quarter of 2017. The Company also expects to realize significant cost savings from branch consolidations, which is expected to provide a total of $6.1 million in annual cost savings. The Company intends to deploy a portion of the savings by further investing in commercial banking and electronic delivery channels while meeting the efficiency targets established in connection with the recent acquisitions. The Company expects to recognize additional branch consolidation expense of $2.1 million in the third quarter of 2017 relating to branch closures in early July. Results of Operations On May 2, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Cape and its results of operations are included in the consolidated results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, but are excluded from the results of operations for the period from January 1, 2016 to May 1, 2016. On November 30, 2016, the Company completed its acquisition of Ocean Shore and its results of operations are included in the consolidated results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, but are excluded from the results of operations for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, was $7.7 million, or $0.23 per diluted share, as compared to $3.7 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year period. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $19.7 million, or $0.59 per diluted share, as compared to net income of $7.9 million, or $0.39 per diluted share, for the corresponding prior year period. Net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, includes merger related and branch consolidation expenses and for the six months ended June 30, 2017, also includes the acceleration of stock award expense from a director retirement. These items decreased net income, net of tax benefit, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, by $5.6 million and $6.7 million, respectively. Net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2016 includes merger related expenses of $7.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively, a Federal Home Loan Bank prepayment fee of $136,000 and a loss on the sale of investment securities available-for-sale of $12,000. Excluding these items, net income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 increased over the prior year periods primarily due to the acquisitions of Cape and Ocean Shore (""Acquisition Transactions""). In addition, in the first quarter of 2017 the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (""ASU"") 2016-09 ""Compensation - Stock Compensation"" which resulted in decreases in income tax expense for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, of $172,000 and $1.5 million, respectively. Net interest income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 increased to $42.2 million and $83.7 million, respectively, as compared to $30.0 million and $50.6 million, respectively, for the same prior year periods, reflecting an increase in interest-earning assets. Average interest-earning assets increased $1.357 billion and $1.805 billion, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the same prior year periods. The averages for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, were favorably impacted by the interest-earning assets acquired in the Acquisition Transactions. The net interest margin remained stable at 3.57% for both the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, and increased to 3.56% for the six months ended June 30, 2017, from 3.47% for the same prior year period. The yields on average interest-earning assets increased to 3.97% and 3.96%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, from 3.94% and 3.86%, respectively, for the same prior year periods. The yields on average interest-earning assets for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 benefited from an increase in the accretion of purchase accounting adjustments of $632,000 and $2.6 million, respectively, and the generally higher interest rate environment. For both the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.49%, from 0.47% and 0.48%, respectively, in the corresponding prior year periods. The total cost of deposits (including non-interest bearing deposits) was 0.28% and 0.27%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to 0.25% for both the three and six months ending June 30, 2016. Net interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 increased $691,000, as compared to the prior linked quarter, as average interest-earning assets increased $12.9 million and the yield on average interest-earning assets increased to 3.97% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, from 3.95% for the prior linked quarter. The net interest margin increased to 3.57% for the three months ended June 30, 2017, from 3.56% for the prior linked quarter. The cost of average interest-bearing liabilities increased to 0.49% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 from 0.48% for the prior linked quarter. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, the provision for loan losses was $1.2 million and $1.9 million, respectively, as compared to $662,000 and $1.2 million, respectively, for the corresponding prior year periods and $700,000 in the prior linked quarter. Net loan charge-offs were $759,000 and $491,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to net loan charge-offs of $198,000 and $1.3 million, respectively, in the corresponding prior year periods, and a $268,000 net loan recovery in the prior linked quarter. Non-performing loans totaled $16.3 million at June 30, 2017, as compared to $21.7 million at March 31, 2017, and $15.3 million at June 30, 2016. The decrease in non-performing loans from the prior quarter was primarily due to the sale of non-performing residential loans totaling $3.9 million and the payoff of two non-performing commercial loans totaling $1.7 million. For the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, other income increased to $7.0 million and $13.0 million, respectively, as compared to $4.9 million and $8.3 million, respectively, in the same prior year periods. The increases were primarily due to the impact of the Acquisition Transactions, which added $1.7 million and $3.8 million, respectively, to other income for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the same prior year periods. Excluding the Acquisition Transactions, the remaining increase in other income was primarily related to higher deposit related fees of $389,000 and $902,000, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the same prior year periods. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, other income increased $978,000, as compared to the prior linked quarter. The increase in other income over the prior linked quarter was primarily due to the net gain from OREO operations for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 of $105,000, as compared to a net loss from OREO operations in the prior linked quarter of $733,000. Operating expenses increased to $37.1 million and $68.1 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $28.6 million and $45.4 million, respectively, in the same prior year periods. Operating expenses for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 included $8.6 million and $10.1 million, respectively, of merger related and branch consolidation expenses, as compared to $7.2 million and $8.6 million, respectively, in the prior year periods. Excluding the impact of merger and branch consolidation expenses, the increase in operating expenses over the prior year was primarily due to the operations of the Cape and Ocean Shore, which added $5.9 million and $17.3 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, excluding the Acquisition Transaction expenses, there were increases in salary compensation, equipment expense and professional fees. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, excluding the Acquisition Transaction expenses, there were increases in salary compensation, stock plan expense, equipment expense and professional fees. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, operating expenses, excluding merger and branch consolidation expenses, decreased $1.0 million, as compared to the prior linked quarter, primarily due to reduced compensation and employee benefits expense. The provision for income taxes was $3.2 million and $7.0 million, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $1.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively, for the same prior year periods. The effective tax rate was 29.2% and 26.1%, respectively, for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to 34.5% and 35.8%, respectively, for the same prior year periods. The lower effective tax rate for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 resulted from the adoption of ASU 2016-09 ""Compensation - Stock Compensation,"" which decreased income tax expense by $172,000 and $1.5 million, respectively. Excluding the impact of ASU 2016-09, the effective tax rate would have been 30.8% and 31.9% for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. Under the ASU, the tax benefits of exercised stock options and vested stock awards are recognized as a benefit to income tax expense in the reporting period in which they occur. The tax benefit relating to the Company's stock plans was $62,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016, which was recorded directly into stockholders equity. The elevated tax benefit for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 was related to the exercise of options assumed in the acquisitions of Cape and Ocean Shore and the increase in the Company's stock price. Financial Condition Total assets increased by $35.1 million to $5.202 billion at June 30, 2017, from $5.167 billion at December 31, 2016. Cash and due from banks decreased by $193.7 million, to $107.7 million at June 30, 2017, from $301.4 million at December 31, 2016, as these funds were deployed into higher-yielding securities which increased $171.8 million. Loans receivable, net, increased by $65.4 million, to $3.869 billion at June 30, 2017 from $3.803 billion at December 31, 2016. Premises and equipment decreased $11.9 million at June 30, 2017, as compared to December 31, 2016, due to the consolidation of 15 branches, of which 5 were closed in early July. The premises and equipment at these locations were written down to their net realizable value and the remaining balance of $5.8 million was reclassified to assets held for sale. Deposits decreased by $10.8 million, to $4.177 billion at June 30, 2017, from $4.188 billion at December 31, 2016. The loan-to-deposit ratio at June 30, 2017 was 92.6%, as compared to 90.8% at December 31, 2016. Stockholders' equity increased to $587.3 million at June 30, 2017, as compared to $572.0 million at December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017, there were 1.8 million shares available for repurchase under the Company's stock repurchase programs. In the six months ended June 30, 2017, the Company did not repurchase any shares under these repurchase programs. Tangible stockholders' equity per common share increased to $13.19 at June 30, 2017, as compared to $12.95 at December 31, 2016. Asset Quality The Company's non-performing loans increased to $16.3 million at June 30, 2017, as compared to $13.6 million at December 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a single commercial real estate relationship with a balance of $4.2 million, which was partly offset by the payoff of two non-performing loans totaling $1.7 million. An increase in non-performing residential mortgage loans in the first quarter of 2017 was largely offset by the bulk sale of non-performing residential loans in the second quarter of 2017. Non-performing loans do not include $5.0 million of purchased credit-impaired (""PCI"") loans acquired in the Acquisition Transactions. The Company's OREO totaled $8.9 million at June 30, 2017, as compared to $9.8 million at December 31, 2016. At June 30, 2017, the Company's allowance for loan losses was 0.42% of total loans, an increase from 0.40% at December 31, 2016. These ratios exclude existing fair value credit marks of $21.8 million at June 30, 2017 on the Ocean Shore, Cape and Colonial American Bank loans. These loans were acquired at fair value with no related allowance for loan losses. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of total non-performing loans was 101.82% at June 30, 2017 as compared to 111.92% at December 31, 2016. Explanation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures Reported amounts are presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (""GAAP""). The Company's management believes that the supplemental non-GAAP information, which consists of reported net income excluding merger related expenses, branch consolidation expenses, accelerated stock award expense relating to a director retirement, loss on sale of investment securities available for sale and FHLB prepayment fee, which can vary from period to period, provides a better comparison of period to period operating performance. Additionally, the Company believes this information is utilized by regulators and market analysts to evaluate a company's financial condition and therefore, such information is useful to investors. These disclosures should not be viewed as a substitute for financial results in accordance with GAAP, nor are they necessarily comparable to non-GAAP performance measures which may be presented by other companies. Please refer to Non-GAAP Reconciliation table at the end of this document for details on the earnings impact of these items.

Announces Second Quarter Financial Results,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oceanfirst-financial-corp-announces-second-quarter-financial-results-2017-07-27
OCFC,"MOUNT LAUREL, N.J., July 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Second Quarter Highlights: On June 30, 2017, Sun Bancorp, Inc. announced an agreement to be acquired by OceanFirst Financial Corp. in a stock and cash merger with an aggregate value of approximately $487 million at the time of the announcement. Second quarter 2017 net income of $1.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, in first quarter of 2017. The Company completed the previously announced redemptions of $15 million and $25 million of trust preferred securities on June 30, 2017 and July 23, 2017, respectively. Net interest margin increased by three basis points to 2.96% in the second quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2017; The acceleration of $415 thousand of deferred issuance costs for the early trust preferred security redemptions reduced net interest margin by nine basis points. Operating expense control continued with quarterly operating expenses of $16.3 million in the second quarter, which includes $400 thousand of merger-related costs as compared to $17.1 million in the prior-year quarter. Continuation of solid asset quality trends with non-performing loans of $4.4 million at June 30, 2017, which is 0.28% of gross loans and net recoveries of $59 thousand in the second quarter; Recorded a negative provision for loan losses of $831 thousand in the second quarter. Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.01 per share to holders of record of the common stock of Sun Bancorp, Inc. as of August 22, 2017, payable on September 6, 2017. Sun Bancorp, Inc. SNBC (the ""Company""), the holding company for Sun National Bank (the ""Bank""), today reported net income of $1.5 million, or $0.08 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, compared to net income of $1.4 million, or $0.07 per diluted share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, and net income of $3.0 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. On June 30, 2017, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with OceanFirst Financial Corp. OCFC, -1.68% (""OceanFirst""), pursuant to which the Company will merge with and into OceanFirst with OceanFirst as the surviving entity (the ""Merger"").  The Merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2018, subject to each company receiving the required approval of its shareholders, receipt of all required regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. ""This quarter was particularly noteworthy for our continued success in managing non-interest expense and our cost of funds, as well as realizing the predicted improvement in the net interest margin,"" said Thomas M. O'Brien, President & CEO.  ""This represents our tenth consecutive profitable quarter, as well as our fifth consecutive quarterly dividend declaration.  This trend of consistently improving our financial performance ultimately culminated with the announcement of the merger agreement with OceanFirst at the end of the quarter.  This strategic partnership represents a milestone for the Company, and recognizes the significant achievements we have made in the last three years.  OceanFirst is an ideal partner whose focus on the community bank business model, geographic markets and business strategies complement those of the Company.  We believe that combining our institutions will create a premier New Jersey community bank that will provide significant value for our shareholders, while also benefiting our customers and the communities that we serve.""  Discussion of Results: Balance Sheet Total assets decreased to $2.22 billion at June 31, 2017, as compared to $2.26 billion at both March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Cash and cash equivalents totaled $127.8 million at June 30, 2017, as compared to $128.9 million at March 31, 2017 and $134.2 million at December 31, 2016.  The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during the first six months of 2017 was primarily due to a reduction in brokered and subscription deposits and the redemption of $15 million of trust preferred securities, partially offset by decreases in net loans receivable and investment securities. Investment securities decreased by $15.6 million to $300.0 million at June 30, 2017 from $315.6 million in the prior linked quarter primarily due to pay downs of $28.9 million and the sale of the remaining collateralized lending obligations portfolio of $13.5 million, partially offset by $26.2 million in purchases of primarily variable rate mortgage-backed securities. Net loans decreased by $20.2 million to $1.57 billion at June 30, 2017 as compared to $1.59 billion at each of March 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, due primarily to the decrease in loan origination and refinancing activity in the Commercial Real Estate (""CRE"") business during the second quarter of 2017.  As a result of the reduction in originations and refinancing activity, non-owner occupied CRE loans fell by $18.3 million in the second quarter.  Offsetting this decrease, the Bank experienced continued momentum in its Commercial and Industrial (""C&I"") business segment.  The C&I segment, which includes owner-occupied CRE and C&I, grew by $9.2 million in the second quarter and has grown 15% annualized in the first half of 2017, due to an increase of $21 million in C&I loans, offset by a decrease of $11.8 million in owner-occupied CRE loans.  Offsetting this growth was continued reductions in residential and home equity loans which fell by $12.0 million in the second quarter as the Bank continued its strategy of not originating new consumer loans. ""Our stated goal of strategically growing the C&I segment continued in this quarter,"" stated O'Brien.  ""Our C&I lending team continues to build momentum throughout the region.  On the CRE segment, we saw slower activity primarily as a result of both higher interest rates as well as continued uncertainty regarding tax reform."" Total deposits decreased to $1.71 billion at June 30, 2017, as compared to $1.73 billion at March 31, 2017 and $1.74 billion at December 31, 2016 due primarily to planned runoff in brokered deposits and subscription deposits.  The cost of deposits increased by one basis point to 40 basis points compared to the prior linked quarter and increased by six basis points as compared to the six months ended June 30, 2016 due to the impact of the recent increase in market interest rates and growth in retail certificates of deposit.  Non-interest deposits rose by $4.5 million to $409.7 million. ""Our ongoing strategy of growing relationship-based deposits continued in the second quarter,"" stated O'Brien.  ""As we reduced our wholesale brokered and other non-relationship deposit accounts, we saw mild growth in our non-interest deposit base.  Despite increasing rates in the external environment, our cost of deposits remains stable and attractive relative to our peers.  We have worked hard to stabilize and grow our deposit portfolio and the related fee income appropriately derived from it."" Net Interest Income and Margin Net interest income was $14.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $14.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, and $14.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016. The Company's net interest margin was 2.96% for the three months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 2.93% for three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2.98% for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  During the second quarter, the Bank accelerated $415 thousand of deferred issuance costs related to two tranches of trust preferred securities, totaling $40 million, which were fully redeemed during June and July of 2017.  This acceleration of costs reduced net interest margin by nine basis points in the second quarter of 2017.  Previous external increases in short-term market interest rates provided a lift to the net interest margin due to the asset-sensitive position in the Company's balance sheet.  The cost of deposits rose by one basis point in the quarter to 0.40% while the loan yield rose by eight basis points to 4.05%.  The Company anticipates $1.2 million of annualized savings due to the trust preferred redemptions. ""In recent years, our elevated cash position has suppressed our net interest margin,"" said O'Brien.  ""We believe that the Company deployed excess liquidity prudently with shorter asset durations and emphasized low cost relationship deposit strategies when interest rates were low.  These tactics are now providing a benefit in the net interest margin after the three moves in short-term interest rates since December of 2016.  Once the Company realizes the full benefit of the trust preferred redemptions, the net interest margin will continue to move in a favorable direction."" Non-Interest Income Non-interest income was $3.0 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, as compared to $3.4 million and $3.8 million for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and June 30, 2016, respectively.  The decrease in non-interest income from the quarter ended March 31, 2017 is due primarily to two loan related fees totaling $550 thousand that were recorded in the first quarter of 2017.  The decrease from the prior year quarter was due to investment sale gains of $426 thousand in the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and higher deposit service charges and fees and investment products income in the prior year quarter.  Non-Interest Expense Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 was $16.3 million as compared to $16.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $17.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2016.  The increase in non-interest expense from the prior linked quarter is due primarily to an increase of $580 thousand in professional fees, partially offset by a $300 thousand expense related to an outstanding letter of credit on a previously-sold legacy loan recorded in the first quarter of 2017.  Professional fees in the second quarter of 2017 include $400 thousand of Merger related expenses.  Non-interest expense for the second quarter of 2017 declined by $777 thousand compared to the second quarter of 2016, primarily due to a decrease of $148 thousand in insurance expense as a result of reductions in FDIC assessment rates, a decrease of $367 thousand in salaries and employee benefit expense, a decrease of $117 thousand in problem loan expense, as well as a decrease of $164 thousand in data processing expense due to efficiency gains, partially offset by an increase of $74 thousand related to equipment expenses. The Bank recorded a vacation accrual in the second quarter of 2017 of $461 thousand.  This expense will be reversed in the second half of the year. ""Our ability to manage expenses continues to be a strength at the Company,"" said O'Brien.  ""While we experienced a one-time Merger-related expense in the current quarter of $400 thousand and some other elevated expenses in the second quarter due to a system conversion, we continue to see favorable long-term trends in operating expenses and additional opportunities to reduce operating expenses further in coming quarters."" Asset Quality Non-performing loans increased by $359 thousand to $4.4 million, or 0.28% of gross loans, at June 30, 2017 from $4.1 million, or 0.25% of gross loans, at March 31, 2017. This increase was primarily due to residential mortgage loans entering non-accrual status during the three months ended June 30, 2017.  Non-performing loans were $5.8 million, or 0.35% of gross loans, at June 30, 2016. There was a negative provision for loan losses of $831 thousand during the quarter ended June 30, 2017 compared to no provision for loan losses during the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and a negative provision for loan losses of $1.7 million recorded in the second quarter of 2016.  Continued credit strength, limited charge-off activity, net recoveries of $59 thousand and loan pay downs resulted in a reduced reserve need at June 30, 2017.  In the first six months of 2017, the Bank recorded net recoveries of $234 thousand as compared to net charge-offs of $434 thousand in the first six months of 2016.  The allowance for loan losses was $14.9 million, or 0.94% of gross loans at June 30, 2017 as compared to $15.7 million, or 0.98% of gross loans at March 31, 2017 and $16.0 million, or 1.02% of gross loans at June 30, 2016.  The allowance for loan losses was 337% of non-performing loans at June 30, 2017 as compared to 385% of non-performing loans at March 31, 2017 and 289% of non-performing loans at June 30, 2016. Capital The Company's capital ratios continue to remain very strong due to positive earnings and a relatively flat balance sheet.  The redemption of trust preferred securities during the second quarter reduced the Company's Tier 2 capital only, and thus only impacted the Company's total risk-based capital ratio.  All capital ratios remain at robust levels and are sufficient to support the Company's strategic plan.  At June 30, 2017, the Bank had a Tier 1 common equity risk-based capital ratio of 18.3%, total risk-based capital ratio of 19.3%, a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 18.3% and a leverage capital ratio of 13.6%. At June 30, 2017, the Company's Tier 1 common equity risk-based capital ratio, total risk-based capital ratio, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio and leverage capital ratio were 16.2%, 21.4%, 19.7%, and 14.7%, respectively.  The Company's tangible equity to tangible assets ratio was 13.2% at June 30, 2017, as compared to 12.8% at March 31, 2017 and 10.5% at June 30, 2016.  Dividend Declaration On July 25, 2017, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a dividend of $0.01 per share to holders of record of the common stock of the Company as of August 22, 2017, payable on September 6, 2017. ""Our primary focus has continued to be delivering value to shareholders,"" said O'Brien.  ""Our regular quarterly dividends reflect our commitment to delivering value to stockholders and our announced transaction with OceanFirst demonstrates our commitment to creating long-term strategic value as well.""

OCFC,"NEW YORK, July 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- WeissLaw LLP is investigating possible breaches of fiduciary duty and other violations of law by the Board of Directors of Sun Bancorp, Inc. (""SNBC"" or the ""Company"") SNBC in connection with the proposed acquisition of the Company by OceanFirst Financial Corp. (""OceanFirst"") OCFC, -1.98%  Under the terms of the agreement, the Company's shareholders can elect to receive $3.78 in cash and 0.7884 of a share of OceanFirst, or else a one-time cash payment or stock for each share of SNBC they own; this represents consideration of $25.27 per SNBC share.  WeissLaw is investigating whether SNBC's Board acted to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.  Notably, the per-share consideration is approximately $3.00 lower than the analyst target price of $28.00, and $1.53 less the Company's 52-week high of $26.80.  Furthermore, the deal is a strategic transaction that will strengthen OceanFirst's industry position.  According the acquisition announcement, this will establish OceanFirst as ""the largest bank headquartered in central and southern New Jersey,"" and grant it access to more robust markets in the neighboring New York and Philadelphia metro areas.  OceanFirst also expects the transaction to be accretive to earnings per share by approximately 3.6% in the year following the completion of the deal.  Given these facts, WeissLaw is investigating whether SNBC's Board acted in the best interests of SNBC's public shareholders to maximize shareholder value prior to entering into the agreement.  If you own SNBC shares and would like more information about your rights or our investigation, or if you have information to share with us, please contact Mark Smilowby telephone at (888) 593-4771 or by email at stockinfo@weisslawllp.com.
