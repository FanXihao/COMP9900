ABG,"MADRID--Spanish renewable energy and engineering firm Abengoa SA said it had reached a restructuring deal with its creditors to avoid Spain's largest-ever bankruptcy, sending shares up nearly 4% in mid-morning trading in Madrid. A group of investors including Centerbridge Partners LP, Elliott Management Corp. and Oaktree Capital Management LP have agreed to inject EUR1.17 billion ($1.31 billion) into the debt-laden company, Abengoa said in a regulatory filing on Thursday. Abengoa will also receive EUR307 million in financial guarantees, the filing said. In exchange, investors and creditor banks, such as Spanish lenders Banco Santander SA and Banco Popular Español SA, are set to own between 90% and 95% of Abengoa, depending on whether it meets certain targets. The company didn't clarify whether 75% of creditors had agreed to the restructuring deal, as required by Spanish bankruptcy law. Abengoa said it plans to hold a telephone conference with investors and analysts on Aug. 16 at noon New York time to provide further details.","Aug 11, 2016 7:27 a.m. ET",1,Abengoa reaches deal to avoid bankruptcy,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/abengoa-reaches-deal-to-avoid-bankruptcy-2016-08-11-74852744
ABG,"We’ve gone from investors lamenting a lousy first-quarter earnings season, especially for the retail sector, to celebrating two consecutive months of better-than-expected growth in retail sales. Tuesday’s report on retail sales in May, after an even stronger report for April, adds to evidence the U.S. economy has sped up this quarter, despite a shockingly weak jobs report for May. It also suggests many retail executives are likely to change their tone when they next report earnings. So we looked at which retailers were winners and losers in several categories during the first quarter and over the past 12 months. Using data provided by FactSet, we examined the S&P Composite 1500’s retail companies and restaurants and added total returns through June 13 for their shares. These five companies increased comparable-store sales the most during the most recently reported quarter: Company Ticker Industry Same-store sales growth - most recent reported quarter Total return - 2016 Total return - 12 months Total return - 3 years MarineMax Inc.

The merger turned out to be a disaster, with sales declines at Jos. A Bank taking down the parent company’s stock. Tailored Brands CEO Doug Ewart made this shocking statement in December: “What we did not know then but do now was just how toxic some of the promotions were, and how deep and far-reaching the transformation required would be, and how significantly near-term performance would suffer as we began to execute painful but necessary steps to restore the long-term sustainable profit model and reshape the business toward a healthy and growing Jos. A. Bank.” It took Ewart a year and a half to figure out that Jos. A Bank’s business model was so heavily dependent on promotions. That’s the sort of thing management needs to know before deciding whether to buy a competitor. The stock dropped 21% last Thursday after another painful earnings report. That in turn followed the company’s announcement in March that it would close 250 stores. Be a true believer before you buy As you can see from the above lists, retail stocks can be quite volatile. Even if a company has a solid business model and has had a successful track record for growth, one quarter that falls short of analysts’ expectations can lead to a major decline in the stock price. Do your own research about the company before making any investment decisions.

Lithia Motors’ stock LAD, +1.41%  tumbled 17% in midday trading to a six-month low, after the eighth-biggest auto dealer cut its third- and fourth-quarter earnings outlooks, as declining used vehicle values weighed on profit margins, and offset an upbeat sales environment. Among shares of other auto dealers, those of sector leader AutoNation AN, +2.03%  slumped over 5.8% to an eight-month low.

All the above stocks jumped on Oct. 2, and extended gains on Oct. 3, after Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway said it was buying Van Tuyl Group, the largest privately-held U.S. auto dealer. At that time, Buffett said he expected to buy more dealerships over time. He now has the chance to do so, at a nice discount, as all the above stocks fell Monday below where they were prior to getting the Buffett boost.

ABG,"LONDON--Tanzania-focused miner African Barrick Gold (AGB.LN) Friday reported an 8% increase in first-half gold production and said it swung to a pretax profit. First-half gold production of 346,581 ounces was 13% higher than a year earlier, while gold sales of 330,947 ounces were 5% higher. The London-based company posted a pretax profit of $62.2 million, having posted a $857.3 million loss a year earlier when it took a hefty impairment charge on one of its mines. Revenue fell to $445.5 million from $487.4 million. The ""all-in sustaining cost"" of production came to $1,118 per ounce sold, 25% lower than the first half of last year, the company said, hailing the success of operational improvements. ""We are pleased to report strong results for [the first half], with increased production and continued cost discipline enabling the business to return to cash generation,"" said Brad Gordon, chief executive officer. The miner said it now expects to produce 700,000 ounces of gold this year, up from guidance of 650,000-690,000 ounces issued in April, as new projects have begun to contribute to production. It also confirmed its cost forecasts.

ABG,"TORONTO-- Barrick Gold Corp. said Monday it will place about 41 million shares of its African Barrick Gold PLC subsidiary with institutional investors as it continues to streamline through cost cutting and asset sales. Toronto-based Barrick said the 41 million shares represent about 10% of London-listed African Barrick, Tanzania's largest gold miner, and about 13.5% of the parent's holdings in the company. The Canadian gold giant said the offering will be made through an accelerated book-build offering process to be launched immediately. The offering has yet to be priced. Barrick Gold last month posted a worse-than-expected fourth-quarter loss, slashed reserves and forecast for lower output this year. The company, which like many large miners bought pricey assets at the top of the commodity cycle, has been working to make itself into a learner gold producer by shedding noncore assets and cutting costs. It sold its jointly owned Marigold mine in Nevada last month. That deal followed the sale of three Australian mines and its energy business last year. African Barrick too has been hit hard by lower gold prices and high operating costs. It posted a net loss last year on high impairment charges.

ABG,"Moody's Investors Service upgraded automotive retailers Group 1 Automotive Inc. GPI, +3.01% and Sonic Automotive Inc. SAH, +4.41% a notch each Wednesday, and increased the prospect of an upgrade for another, Asbury Automotive Group Inc. ABG, +2.97% because of improved operating performance. The firm upgraded Group 1 to Ba3, which is three notches below investment grade and the highest rating among the three companies in Wednesday's ratings actions. Moody's said the company's better operating results in the last few quarters have strengthened credit metrics. Analyst Charlie O'Shea noted Group 1 has largely maintained cost savings it implemented in late 2008, which has resulted in higher earnings and thus improved leverage. ""In addition, Group 1 has obtained new revolving and floorplan facilities, with the 2016 maturities improving its financial flexibility,"" he said. The rating has a stable outlook, as Moody's believes Group 1 would continue to manage its cost structure to preserve the resiliency of its operating performance even in the event of a downturn. Separately, Moody's raised its rating on Sonic a notch to B1, which is four steps below investment grade, because of its improved credit profile resulting from its better operating performance. ""Sonic continues to generate solid traction from its favorable brand mix, and has largely avoided most of the issues with respect to the Japanese manufacturers that have occurred during 2011,"" O'Shea said. He said Sonic continues to reduce debt and improve earnings. The rating has a stable outlook, reflecting the ratings company's belief that its brand mix will continue to resonate with consumers and that Sonic will continue to manage its expenses prudently, which--like Group 1--would likely keep credit metrics in balance even in a downturn. For Asbury, Moody's raised its outlook on the company to positive from stable, while it affirmed its B2 rating, which is five steps below investment grade. O'Shea noted that Asbury's debt-protection measures have improved because of its better operating performance but said the challenge for the company is now to improve its interest coverage. He also said Asbury could experience additional positive ratings momentum if it successfully replaces or renews its revolving credit facilities with a looming August expiration. Shares in all three company's were down in recent trading. Group 1 shares were down 1.2% at $37.74, Sonic shares fell 4.2% to $11.36 and Asbury shares were 2.1% lower at $17.44.

ABG,"-First half net profit up 21%; doubles interim dividend -Reaffirms annual gold output, cost guidance -Expects cash costs to fall after rising 24% on year in first half (adds details and updates share price) LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Anglo-Tanzanian miner African Barrick Gold PLC (ABG.LN) Tuesday said first half net profit rose 21% and reaffirmed plans to meet its annual cost and production targets despite suffering setbacks in the second quarter. The FTSE-100 miner will to double its interim dividend to 3.2 U.S. cents a share after reporting record cash margins, due in part to surging spot gold prices. ""Looking ahead, we are confident the business is well positioned to continue delivering strong results over the second half of 2011 as we start to see the benefits of the operational improvements we have made at Buzwagi, the continued delivery from our other three mines and ongoing progress on our portfolio of growth projects,"" Greg Hawkins, African Barrick Gold's chief executive said in a statement. First half revenue rose 30% on year to $446 million and contributed to a 25% on year rise in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or Ebitda to $196 million and net profit attributable to shareholders of $120 million. The gold miner boosted its profitability despite a 3% decline in first half gold output to 356,208 troy ounces by achieving a 26% on year rise in average gold sale prices and through gold inventory management. African Barrick Gold expects production to rise in the second half following a challenging first half operating environment in which it suffered an illegal attack on its North Mara mine and a SAG mill motor failure at its Buzwagi mine. African Barrick Gold is still targeting 700,000 to 760,000 ounces of gold output in 2011. It expects to lower its annual cash cost to $590/oz to $650/oz in 2011 from $655/oz in the first half as output ramps up in the second half. First half cash costs rose 24% on the year as a result of cost inflation and mine sequencing at North Mara. The company has also become more reliant on back-up diesel power generators as Tanzania's hydro-reliant power grid suffers due to East Africa's severe drought. Hawkins said he was not concerned about initial Tanzanian government rumblings over a windfall tax on mining companies since the company's tax agreements at its four operating mines in Tanzania--Bulyanhulu, Buzwagi, North Mara and Tulawaka--are legally binding. Furthermore the company has a good working relationship with the government to determine an economically viable tax structure for future projects, he added. African Barrick Gold has $455 million of cash on hand and is still considering mergers and acquisitions in West and Northeast Africa, Hawkins said. It also expects to finalize the details of a secondary listing on the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange within the next few weeks, the company's head of investor relations Andrew Wray said. At 1149 GMT, African Barrick Gold's shares were up 21.40 pence or 4.4% at 210.50p.","July 26, 2011 9:02 a.m. ET",1,"African Barrick Gold affirms targets, ups dividend",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/african-barrick-gold-affirms-targets-ups-dividend-2011-07-26
ABG,"The scramble for smart-grid technology to monitor, measure and better manage electricity, water, and traffic is gathering place. Take Schneider Electric's EUR1.4-billion ($2 billion) acquisition of Madrid-based, Nasdaq-listed specialist software company Telvent. Schneider is overpaying. But the French energy-management specialist is sticking to a stated goal of bite-sized acquisitions after flirting with a high-risk transformational deal earlier this year. Schneider has offered $40 a share in cash for Telvent, 40%-held by Spanish industrial group Abengoa which is tendering its shares. At a 16% premium to Tuesday's closing price, the Telvent offer is not cheap. At 12 times forecast 2011 Ebitda, it is paying less than the 20 times Ebitda ABB paid for Ventyx last year. But taxed and capitalized, estimated cost savings of $13 million a year are worth less than $100 million - not enough to cover the $210 million premium. To make the numbers stack up, Schneider is counting on boosting Telvent's $1-billion sales, currently 40% from transport and a third from Spain, with revenue gains of up to $40 million by 2016. The potential is there. Schneider, a leading maker of devices and sensors which measure electricity flows for utilities, factories and buildings, is profiting from a world of rising electricity demand, rapid urbanization, and tightening environmental standards. It also supplies software to control and protect power networks and maximize their efficient use. Telvent has developed software to pull that data together for utilities among other customers. Systems integration might account for $46 billion of the $120-billion market for upgrading power grids in the U.S. and Europe, according to Bernstein. True, the transaction is small in the context of Schneider's EUR20-billion annual sales. Still, having scared investors in April with a $30-billion approach, since abandoned, to security and fire-protection company Tyco International, Chief Executive Jean-Pascal Tricoire needed to reassure them he's not letting an A-grade credit rating go to his head. Acquisition risk helps explain why Schneider's shares have treaded water this year. Smoothly plugging in Telvent will help ease their concerns.","June 1, 2011 11:56 a.m. ET",1,Schneider in smart-grid asset scramble,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/schneider-in-smart-grid-asset-scramble-2011-06-01
ABG,"(This article was originally published Thursday.) New Alternatives NALFX, -0.24% mutual fund is in a quandary--when a company in its portfolio becomes too successful, it might have to leave the fold. New Alternatives, which has $251.3 million under management, is the vegan to some other environmentally conscious mutual funds' vegetarianism. The fund invests in more than 30 alternative-energy and related companies world-wide, including power providers that use wind, solar and geothermal energy to turn their generators. But the fund's strict investment criteria dictate that it stay away from companies with even the slightest taint of coal or oil, or may have suspect labor practices. The hydrocarbon taboo is becoming more relevant as more clean-energy businesses are bought by the likes of BP (BP, BP.LN), Exxon Mobil Corp. XOM, +2.47% and other traditional energy producers. New Alternatives plans to drop two of the more-successful companies in its portfolio--French wind-power and ocean-energy provider EDF Energies Nouvelles SA (EEN.FR) and U.S. solar-cell manufacturer SunPower Corp. SPWRA -- because they were recently acquired by companies with coal and oil assets, a strict no-no for New Alternatives, said fund co-founder and manager David Schoenwald. ""It's becoming a problem for us,"" Schoenwald said. ""I'd rather have the companies that were taken over and not the companies that took them over."" Still, those companies did well for New Alternatives before being shown the exit. As of Wednesday's market close, SunPower shares were up 66% year-to-date, while those for EDF Energies were up nearly 27%. Currently, the three heaviest companies in the fund are American Water Works Co. AWK, +1.16% at 5.40%, biomass and solar-energy business Abengoa SA (ABG.MC) at 6.37%, and renewable-energy provider EDP Renovaveis SA (EDRVY, EDPR.LB) at 6.59% Alternative-energy investors spooked by Japan's post-earthquake problems with its nuclear plants have shown renewed interest in New Alternatives, which eschews nuclear power as too dangerous, Shoenwald said. Instead of nuclear, the fund prefers natural gas. Nearly 4% of the fund is invested in Northwest Natural Gas NWN, -0.09% an Oregon-based natural-gas distributor that was up 4.4% year over year as of Wednesday's market close. High oil prices have not been such a boon for the fund, however. Most of its holdings are in power utilities, where renewables face off against relatively cheap natural gas and have no real cost advantage. One of the companies still in New Alternatives' portfolio that Shoenwald finds compelling--if not currently successful-- is Ormat Technologies Inc. ORA, -1.36% a Nevada-based business that designs, builds and operates power plants that run off geothermal energy. Problems at Ormat's plant in North Brawley, Calif., helped bring down its first-quarter earnings and caused its stock to plunge more than 25% year-to-date as of Wednesday. But the company remains fundamentally sound and its shares should grow again, Shoenwald said. ""I think they can turn it around, but it could take some time,"" Schoenwald said. Even with that poor performance, the fund is up 12% year-to-date as of Wednesday's market close, according to investment website Morningstar.com, compared to 6% for its World Stock benchmark. The fund's five-year return is 9.3%, lower than the benchmark's 12.3% return. New Alternatives' focus on alternative energy makes it attractive to environmentally conscious investors, Morningstar equities analyst Kathyrn Young said. But being tied to a sector that is subject to the whim of government policy makers, the fund is best suited for investors who don't mind dramatic ups and downs, Young said. ""It's a good fund to look at if you are specifically interested in investing in alternative energy,"" Young said. ""But otherwise you might want to think again--it's highly volatile and highly concentrated."" More from MarketWatch Can the Democrats Ride a Blue Wave to Midterm Election Wins?

ABG,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- General Motors Corp. shares plunged 15% on Wednesday, pushing through levels not seen since the early 1950s after Merrill Lynch warned clients it might be time to bail out on the troubled automaker. GM's GM, +2.45% stock dropped $1.77 to close at $9.98 after Merrill analyst John Murphy slashed his rating on the Dow component to underperform from buy with a price target of $7 a share. He also downgraded several key parts suppliers. ""We believe that the pressure on the industry is extreme enough that it is putting the entire automotive value chain at risk, including even once obvious stalwarts,"" he said. ""Large factors are becoming increasingly obvious including declining volumes, deteriorating mix and rising raw materials that are conspiring to compress profits."" GM handed in an 18% drop in monthly vehicle sales on Tuesday, sideswiped by plunging consumer confidence and record-high gas prices. The stock moved up slightly on the news as Wall Street had expected an even more severe decline. See full story. Murphy lauded GM's vast restructuring strides but said three factors have combined to ""dwarf"" the company's best efforts. Topping the list, GM needs to tap the capital markets for up to $15 billion as its cash burn rate goes up with every drop in sales. ""Regardless of its structure, however, the bridge financing necessary for the next two years is likely to be larger and more expensive than recognized,"" Murphy said. Next, he pointed out that the drastic sales declines that have continually rattled the sector will also remain a factor through 2009. Murphy lowered his 2008 light vehicle sales target to 14.3 million cars and trucks from a prior estimate of 14.8 million. ""The weakness in demand and deteriorating mix through the first half of 2008 are just the beginning of what is shaping up to be a more severe downturn than even the most bearish industry observers expected,"" he said. And finally, GM's SUV segment is on the verge of becoming obsolete, eating away at the company's profit potential, he said. A drop in auction pricing provides the clearest evidence that demand has all but dried up completely. Murphy noted that large SUVs aren't even attracting any bids most of the time and many dealers won't even take them as trade-ins. As GM and its competitors continue to struggle, the suppliers that rely heavily on them for their business are feeling the heat. Hence, Murphy cut his rating on Visteon Corp. VC, +2.18% and ArvinMeritor Inc. ARM, +3.57% to underperform and Asbury Automotive Group ABG, +2.97% to neutral. Visteon shares fell 16.7% to end at $2.19 while Asbury lost 11% to close at $11.49. ArvinMeritor initially moved higher after the company gave a bullish outlook for the rest of its fiscal year, citing strong international growth. But the stock succumbed to the broader market pressure and finished down 9.2% at $11.21. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co. GT, +0.83% remains Murphy's top pick in the group. The stock closed off 2.7% at $17.55.

Forward-looking statements are statements other than historical fact, and may include statements relating to goals, plans, market conditions and projections regarding Asbury's financial position, liquidity, results of operations, market position and dealership portfolio, and other initiatives and future business strategy.  These statements are based on management's current expectations and beliefs and involve significant risks and uncertainties that may cause results to differ materially from those set forth in the statements.  These risks and uncertainties include, among other things, market factors, Asbury's relationships with, and the financial and operational stability of, vehicle manufacturers and other suppliers, acts of God or other incidents which may adversely impact supply from vehicle manufacturers and/or present retail sales challenges, risks associated with Asbury's indebtedness (including available borrowing capacity, compliance with its financial covenants and ability to refinance or repay such indebtedness, on favorable terms), Asbury's relationships with, and the financial stability of, its lenders and lessors, risks related to competition in the automotive retail and service industries, general economic conditions both nationally and locally, governmental regulations, legislation, adverse results in litigation and other proceedings, and Asbury's ability to execute its IT initiatives and other operational strategies, Asbury's ability to leverage gains from its dealership portfolio, Asbury's ability to capitalize on opportunities to repurchase its debt and equity securities or purchase properties that it currently leases, and Asbury's ability to stay within its targeted range for capital expenditures.  There can be no guarantees that Asbury's plans for future operations will be successfully implemented or that they will prove to be commercially successful. These and other risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements are and will be discussed in Asbury's filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission from time to time, including its most recent annual report on Form 10-K and any subsequently filed quarterly reports on Form 10-Q.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.   ASBURY AUTOMOTIVE GROUP, INC.

Supplemental Disclosures (Unaudited) Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure and Reconciliation In addition to evaluating the financial condition and results of our operations in accordance with GAAP, from time to time management evaluates and analyzes results and any impact on the Company of strategic decisions and actions relating to, among other things, cost reduction, growth, and profitability improvement initiatives, and other events outside of normal, or ""core,"" business and operations, by considering certain alternative financial measures not prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures include ""Adjusted leverage ratio,"" ""Adjusted income from operations,"" ""Adjusted net income,"" "" Adjusted operating margins,"" and ""Adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS"")."" Further, management assesses the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance at our existing locations. Same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures considered and evaluated by management are reviewed in conjunction with a review of the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but also to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. In their evaluation of results from time to time, management excludes items that do not arise directly from core operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature. Because these non-core, unusual or non-recurring charges and gains materially affect Asbury's financial condition or results in the specific period in which they are recognized, management also evaluates, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions based on, the related non-GAAP measures excluding such items.  In addition to using such non-GAAP measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management believes that such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and a better indication of expected future trends. Management discloses these non-GAAP measures, and the related reconciliations, because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer-term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess operating performance. The following tables provide reconciliations for our non-GAAP metrics:  For the Twelve Months Ended  December 31, 2017  September 30, 2017  (Dollars in millions) Adjusted leverage ratio:    Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 875.5  $ 915.7     Calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA""):    Net Income $ 139.1  $ 163.7     Add:    Depreciation and amortization 32.1  31.7 Income tax expense 70.0  97.8 Swap and other interest expense 55.9  55.8 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") $ 297.1  $ 349.0     Non-core items - (income) expense:    Franchise rights impairment $ 5.1  $ — Real estate-related charges 2.9  3.4 Investment income (0.8)  (0.8) Legal settlements (0.9)  (7.5) Gain on divestitures —  (45.5)   Total non-core items 6.3  (50.4)     Adjusted EBITDA $ 303.4  $ 298.6     Adjusted leverage ratio 2.9  3.1     For the Three Months Ended December 31,  2017  2016  (In millions, except per share data) Adjusted income from operations:    Income from operations $ 74.1  $ 80.1 Franchise  Right Impairment 5.1  — Real estate-related charges —  0.5 Legal settlements —  (6.6) Adjusted income from operations $ 79.2  $ 74.0     Adjusted net income:    Net income $ 42.5  $ 67.1     Non-core items - (income) expense:    Franchise rights impairment 5.1  — Legal settlements —  (6.6) Real estate-related charges —  0.5 Gain on divestitures —  (45.5) Income tax (benefit) expense on non-core items above (1.9)  19.4 Discrete Tax Items (7.9)  (0.9) Total non-core items (4.7)  (33.1) Adjusted net income $ 37.8  $ 34.0     Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS):    Diluted EPS $ 2.03  $ 3.08     Total non-core items (0.22)  (1.52) Adjusted diluted EPS $ 1.81  $ 1.56     Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 20.9  21.8     For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,  2017  2016  (In millions, except per share data) Adjusted income from operations:    Income from operations $ 287.7  $ 297.8 Franchise  Right Impairment 5.1  — Real estate-related charges 2.9  5.7 Investment income (0.8)  — Legal settlements (0.9)  (6.6) Adjusted income from operations $ 294.0  $ 296.9     Adjusted net income:    Net income $ 139.1  $ 167.2     Non-core items - (income) expense:    Franchise rights impairment 5.1  — Real estate-related charges 2.9  5.7 Investment income (0.8)  — Legal settlements (0.9)  (6.6) Gain on Divestitures —  (45.5) Income tax (benefit) expense on non-core items above (2.4)  17.4 Discrete Tax Items (7.9)  (0.9) Total non-core items (4.0)  (29.9) Adjusted net income $ 135.1  $ 137.3     Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS):    Diluted EPS $ 6.62  $ 7.40     Total non-core items (0.19)  (1.32) Adjusted diluted EPS $ 6.43  $ 6.08     Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 21.0  22.6     View original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/asbury-automotive-group-announces-2017-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-financial-results-300593840.html SOURCE Asbury Automotive Group, Inc.

ABG,"SAN FRANCISCO, Jan 09, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- The Presidio Group advised the ownership of Terry Lee Companies, Inc. in the sale of the Honda dealership in Avon, Indiana, west of Indianapolis, to Asbury Automotive Group, Inc., the owner of 94 retail automotive franchises in the U.S. including ten Honda franchises and Hare Chevrolet in the Indianapolis market area. Terry Lee Honda will be renamed Hare Honda. The transaction involving the Honda dealership was completed January 8, 2018. Terms were not disclosed. “I am very pleased with the result and timing of this transaction. I am confident that Asbury is truly the right buyer for our employees and our customers,” said Terry Lee, Owner of Terry Lee Honda. Mr. Lee has over 40 years of automotive retail experience in the Midwest, beginning his career at age 21 in Indianapolis before moving to Cincinnati, Ohio to open Terry Lee Chevrolet. He returned home to the Indianapolis market area in 2008 to open Terry Lee Honda, which has consistently won the Honda President’s Award, been on the Top 100 Automotive News Best Dealerships to Work For list, and received the Indianapolis Star Top Workplaces Award as one of the top 75 employers in Indiana for six years in a row. In 2014, Terry Lee started Terry Lee Crossing, a 72-acre commercial real estate development on Highway 37, just ten minutes north of Indianapolis in Noblesville. In 2015, he built new dealerships for the Genesis and Hyundai franchises with room for five more manufacturers or other commercial properties. This will now be his primary focus. “The Presidio Group provided excellent representation and ran a thorough and confidential process,” Mr. Lee continued. “Asbury is very happy with this acquisition as it further expands our footprint in this great market. Terry Lee Honda is a well-run operation with a great reputation,” said David Hult, President and Chief Executive Officer of Asbury. “We look forward to further success in the Indianapolis market with Hare Honda and with Hare Chevrolet.” “Presidio is honored to have assisted in bringing this transaction together,” said Brodie Cobb. Mr. Cobb is Founder and CEO of The Presidio Group, which advised Mr. Lee in the sale of the Honda dealership. “Terry Lee is an excellent dealer who has worked hard over the years to earn the dealership’s stellar reputation. This transaction is evidence that buyers are still actively looking for quality franchises.” Geoffrey Grodner and Dustin Plummer of Mallor Grodner LLP served as legal counsel to Terry Lee Companies.

ABG,"DULUTH, Ga., Oct. 24, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Asbury Automotive Group, Inc. ABG, +2.97% one of the largest automotive retail and service companies in the U.S., reported net income for the third quarter 2017 of $30.7 million, or $1.48 per diluted share. During the quarter, we had two non-recurring events that negatively impacted our results.  First, our dealerships in Florida, Georgia, and Houston, Texas had various levels of business interruption due to Hurricanes Irma and Harvey. We believe the net impact of the hurricanes was a reduction in earnings of at least $0.10 per diluted share.  Second, the CEO transition announced in August resulted in an accounting charge of $0.05 per diluted share. We did not adjust our earnings for the above events. ""Our team did an outstanding job managing through the tragic storms that we experienced this quarter.  Due to their efforts we were able to limit the storms' impact on our business,"" said Craig Monaghan, Asbury's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""Despite the hurricanes, we were able to grow our F&I and parts and service business,"" said Asbury's Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer, David Hult. ""This together with strong expense control helped us improve our industry-leading operating margin to 4.4% for the quarter."" For the nine-month period ended September 30, 2017, the Company reported net income of $96.6 million, or $4.60 per diluted share. Additional commentary regarding the third quarter results will be provided during the earnings conference call on October 24 at 10:00 a.m.  The conference call will be simulcast live on the internet and can be accessed at www.asburyauto.com or www.ccbn.com.

Supplemental Disclosures (Unaudited) Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure and Reconciliation In addition to evaluating the financial condition and results of our operations in accordance with GAAP, from time to time management evaluates and analyzes results and any impact on the Company of strategic decisions and actions relating to, among other things, cost reduction, growth, and profitability improvement initiatives, and other events outside of normal, or ""core,"" business and operations, by considering certain alternative financial measures not prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures include ""Adjusted leverage ratio,"" ""Adjusted income from operations,"" ""Adjusted income from continuing operations,"" "" Adjusted operating margins,"" and ""Adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") from continuing operations."" Further, management assesses the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance at our existing locations. Same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures considered and evaluated by management are reviewed in conjunction with a review of the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but also to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. In their evaluation of results from time to time, management excludes items that do not arise directly from core operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature. Because these non-core, unusual or non-recurring charges and gains materially affect Asbury's financial condition or results in the specific period in which they are recognized, management also evaluates, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions based on, the related non-GAAP measures excluding such items.  In addition to using such non-GAAP measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management believes that such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and a better indication of expected future trends. Management discloses these non-GAAP measures, and the related reconciliations, because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer-term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess operating performance.

Supplemental Disclosures (Unaudited) Non-GAAP Financial Disclosure and Reconciliation In addition to evaluating the financial condition and results of our operations in accordance with GAAP, from time to time management evaluates and analyzes results and any impact on the Company of strategic decisions and actions relating to, among other things, cost reduction, growth, and profitability improvement initiatives, and other events outside of normal, or ""core,"" business and operations, by considering certain alternative financial measures not prepared in accordance with GAAP. These measures include ""Adjusted leverage ratio,"" ""Adjusted income from operations,"" ""Adjusted income from continuing operations,"" and ""Adjusted diluted earnings per share (""EPS"") from continuing operations."" Further, management assesses the organic growth of our revenue and gross profit on a same store basis. We believe that our assessment on a same store basis represents an important indicator of comparative financial performance and provides relevant information to assess our performance at our existing locations. Same store amounts consist of information from dealerships for identical months in each comparative period, commencing with the first month we owned the dealership. Additionally, amounts related to divested dealerships are excluded from each comparative period. Non-GAAP measures do not have definitions under GAAP and may be defined differently by and not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. As a result, any non-GAAP financial measures considered and evaluated by management are reviewed in conjunction with a review of the most directly comparable measures calculated in accordance with GAAP. Management cautions investors not to place undue reliance on such non-GAAP measures, but also to consider them with the most directly comparable GAAP measures. In their evaluation of results from time to time, management excludes items that do not arise directly from core operations, or are otherwise of an unusual or non-recurring nature. Because these non-core, unusual or non-recurring charges and gains materially affect Asbury's financial condition or results in the specific period in which they are recognized, management also evaluates, and makes resource allocation and performance evaluation decisions based on, the related non-GAAP measures excluding such items.  In addition to using such non-GAAP measures to evaluate results in a specific period, management believes that such measures may provide more complete and consistent comparisons of operational performance on a period-over-period historical basis and a better indication of expected future trends. Management discloses these non-GAAP measures, and the related reconciliations, because it believes investors use these metrics in evaluating longer-term period-over-period performance, and to allow investors to better understand and evaluate the information used by management to assess operating performance. The following tables provide reconciliations for our non-GAAP metrics:  For the Twelve Months Ended  March 31, 2017  December 31, 2016  (Dollars in millions) Adjusted leverage ratio:    Long-term debt (including current portion) $ 923.0  $ 926.7     Calculation of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization(""EBITDA""):    Income from continuing operations $ 170.2  $ 167.2     Add:    Depreciation and amortization 31.0  30.7 Income tax expense 100.4  100.6 Swap and other interest expense 56.0  56.2 Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (""EBITDA"") $ 357.6  $ 354.7     Non-core items - (income) expense:    Legal settlements $ (7.5)  $ (6.6) Real estate-related charges 2.3  5.7 Gain on divestitures (45.5)  (45.5)   Total non-core items (50.7)  (46.4)     Adjusted EBITDA $ 306.9  $ 308.3     Adjusted leverage ratio 3.0  3.0     For the Three Months EndedMarch 31,  2017  2016  (In millions, except per share data) Adjusted income from operations:    Income from operations $ 72.3  $ 68.9 Real estate-related charges —  3.4 Legal settlements (0.9)  — Adjusted income from operations $ 71.4  $ 72.3     Adjusted income from continuing operations:    Income from continuing operations $ 34.0  $ 31.1     Non-core items - (income) expense:    Legal settlements (0.9)  — Real estate-related charges —  3.4 Income tax benefit 0.3  (1.3) Total non-core items (0.6)  2.1 Adjusted income from continuing operations $ 33.4  $ 33.2     Adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) from continuing operations:    Net income $ 1.61  $ 1.27 Discontinued operations, net of tax —  — Income from continuing operations $ 1.61  $ 1.27     Total non-core items (0.03)  0.09 Adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations $ 1.58  $ 1.36     Weighted average common shares outstanding - diluted 21.1  24.4     To view the original version on PR Newswire, visit:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/asbury-automotive-group-announces-first-quarter-2017-financial-results-300446804.html SOURCE Asbury Automotive Group, Inc.
