OBLN,"Coupa Software Inc. COUP, -0.90%  shares soared in the software company’s market debut Thursday, one of the busiest days for initial public offering activity so far this year. Four IPOs started trading Thursday, tying for the second-busiest day of the year, according to Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused ETFs. Coupa led the pack in terms of share gains, more than doubling at one point, which put the company’s market capitalization higher than its $1 billion valuation in its final private funding round. Shares of Coupa closed up 85% from the issue price of $18. Advanced Disposal Services ADSW, -0.29%  , Obalon Therapeutics Inc. OBLN, +4.08% and AquaVenture Holdings Ltd. WAAS, -1.45%   also debuted on the public market Thursday. Coupa’s share pop follows last week’s eye-popping gainsmade by Nutanix Inc. NTNX, -1.71%  , another so-called unicorn, with a private valuation of at least $1 billion. Both are also notable as venture-backed technology company offerings, which have been few and far between in the IPO market this year. The busiest day this year, with five IPOs trading, was May 26. Four of the five busiest days for IPOs have happened in the last 30 days, according to Renaissance. Matthew Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance, said this pattern of strong performances in amrket debuts likely means a pickup in the number of offerings for the rest of the year and 2017, as well as happy technology startup founders. “This is the IPO market that they’ve been holding out for,” Kennedy wrote in an email. Potential IPOs in the pipeline include Snap, parent company of Snapchat Inc., which The Wall Street Journal reported is working on going public as early as March.

[Click here to join this class action] Obalon Therapeutics, Inc. is a medical device company that focuses on developing and commercializing medical gastric balloons for weight loss therapy. The Company claims that its initial product offering is the Obalon balloon system, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (''FDA'') approved swallowable, gas-filled intra-gastric balloon designed to provide progressive and sustained weight loss in obese patients. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company's business, operational and compliance policies. Specifically, Defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (i) the Company recognized revenue in violation of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (''GAAP''); (ii) the Company lacked adequate internal controls over accounting and financial reporting; and (iii) as a result, Obalon's public statements were materially false and misleading at all relevant times. On January 23, 2018, Obalon issued a press release entitled ''Obalon Announces Termination of Public Offering of Common Stock,'' revealing that ''a purported whistleblower contacted KPMG LLP, the Company's independent auditors, to make certain allegations relating to allegedly improper revenue recognition during the Company's fourth fiscal quarter of 2017.'' The press release further stated that ''Obalon's Audit Committee will oversee an internal investigation of these allegations.'' On this news, Obalon's share price fell $1.73, or 33.33%, to close at $3.46 on January 23, 2018, on unusually heavy volume. The $3.46 closing price represented a total decline of $11.54, or nearly 77%, from the IPO price of $15.00 per share.

The demand for weight management continues to increase as obesity posts an enormous challenge to healthcare in developed countries as well as in lower and middle-income economies. According to the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, about 30% of the global population is either obese or overweight. In addition, increasing awareness of obesity's impacts on health further drives the growth of the market.

John LaRosa, the Research Director of Marketdata, said: ""The number of active dieters is estimated to have fallen 10% since 2015, to 97 million, due to a growing size acceptance movement and dieter fatigue. About 80% try to lose weight by themselves, but many fail and the latest CDC statistics show that we are getting fatter, not thinner. The new 2018 diet season is about to begin in late December, and the giants of the market are strongly positioned for more gains."" BioCorRx Inc. (otcqb:BICX) yesterday announced, ""an update on the pilot program for weight loss with Atlantis Medical Wellness & Weight Loss Center. The weight loss program began in October 2017 and the Company reports that Atlantis has successfully enrolled a total of twelve individuals to date as planned into the program. The initial results have been positive as reported by patients. As mentioned in the Company's previous release, BioCorRx has teamed up with Dr. Benjamin Gonzalez, Medical Director of Atlantis Medical Wellness & Weight Loss Center in Silver Spring, MD.

Brady Granier, CEO, President, and Director of BioCorRx, stated, ""We are very pleased with the feedback we have received from Dr. Gonzalez and the patients enrolled in the pilot program to date. We anticipated that this program would help individuals struggling with their weight in some way, but it's great to actually hear the excitement from those enrolled thus far. One of the first patients who enrolled in the program reported a weight loss of 25 pounds after three months along with healthier lifestyle habits. So far, most of the participants polled have expressed reduced cravings for food. We look forward to completing the pilot mid-year and plan to begin marketing the official weight loss program as anticipated immediately thereafter."" Zafgen,Inc.
