AAV,"We look for stocks in bullish consolidation patterns that appear poised to continue their uptrend, and here are four to watch. Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd. AAV, +3.51%  has formed a bullish rising triangle pattern in the last two months, consolidating after a more than 50% upmove from $2.50 in June. With a gain of 18 cents (+4.8%) to $3.93 on Monday, the stock is up against the resistance line of the triangle. If it breaks above $4, our targets are $4.15 and then $4.40. Aon Plc AON, +0.62%  has been in a bullish sideways channel for the last two months in the $51 to $53 range. On Monday, it rose 1.9% to reach the top of the channel. A break from here would lead to targets of $53.86 and $54.58. Jazz Pharmaceuticals JAZZ, +2.26% is flagging in the $58.50 area after a big up-move of more than 30% in the middle of September. The stock is also up against a rising long-term upper trendline going back more than a year. A break through this level would put the stock in all-time high territory and could accelerate prices. Genomic Health Inc. GHDX, +0.48% is also in a bullish flag formation, digesting its steep rally of more than 20% in September. On Monday, the stock broke out of the flag with a move up $1.20 to $35.89. It faces a key resistance level at $36.50 that has contained prices since July, a break of which would continue the up move in all-time high territory.

AAV,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Canadian shares surged Tuesday, rebounding sharply from the prior day's sell-off, as investors keyed in on the first round of Canadian bank earnings and a positive reading on U.S. consumers' sentiment. The S&P/TSX Composite (ISPTX) index jumped 130 points, or 1.2%, to end at 10,921, led by a 3.6% gain in financials. Toronto-traded shares of Bank of Montreal (BMO) BMO, +1.22% jumped 6.7%, gaining after third-quarter results showed net income of C$557 million, up 6.9% from a year ago. Earnings per share of 97 Canadian cents topped the consensus forecast of 94 cents, according to estimates compiled by FactSet Research. Also higher, shares of Royal Bank of Canada (RY)(RY) gained 4.1%, Toronto-Dominion Bank (TD) TD, +1.34% added 3.3% and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CM) CM, +1.05% moved up 3.8%. A rise in capital-markets activity likely helped Canadian banks avoid steeper drops in earnings in their most recent quarter, mirroring a trend that also helped second-quarter results at U.S. banks, analysts say. See full story on third-quarter earnings. ""We believe (BMO) has successfully improved their domestic business over the last 12 to 24 months,"" said TD Newcrest analysts in a note. ""The challenge will be to maintain and build upon recent trends through revenue, volume and market share growth,"" they said. ""This may grow increasingly difficult as market conditions continue to moderate."" On Wednesday, CIBC is expected to announce fiscal third-quarter earnings of $1.39, a 16% drop compared to a year ago, according to analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters. Miners rally as gold futures rise Canada's metals and miners sector increased 2.2%. Gold futures rose as a weakening U.S. dollar raised the metal's investment appeal. December gold futures gained $2.30, or 0.2%, to end at $946 an ounce on the Comex division of the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract dropped more than 1% Monday. See full story on metals stocks. Canadian-listed shares of Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. (IVN) rose 24%, Equinox Minerals Ltd. (EQN) increased 3%, Yamana Gold Inc. (YRI) added 1.8% and Lundin Mining Corp. (LUN) gained 2.3% August copper fell 6 cents, or 2.1%, to $2.854 a pound. It ended at $2.914 Monday, the highest settlement for a front-month contract since late September. Canadian-listed shares of copper miners Teck Resources Ltd. (TCK.B) TCK fell 1.6% and West Timmins Mining Inc. (WTM) dropped 7.2%. Energy sector falls, takes back early gains The energy sector rose 0.1% following several mergers and acquisitions taking place on Monday. Daylight Resources Trust agreed to acquire Highpine Oil & Gas Ltd.; Crescent Point Energy Corp. (CPG) announced the acquisition of Wave Energy, a private producer in the Sakatchewan prairie province; and Crescent Point announced it would acquire a group of Saskatchewan assets. Canadian-listed shares of Highpine (HPX) rose 1.7% and Daylight (DAY.UN) gained 1.5%. Blackmont Capital upgraded Highpine to outperform from sector perform, raising the target price to $8 from $5 because the company produces high-quality crude-oil and has the best balance sheet in its peer group, according to a note released Tuesday. Highpine's current market price is $6.79. Other recent purchases include NuVista Energy Ltd.'s (NVA) procurement of Advantage Oil & Gas Ltd.'s (AAV) AAV, +3.51% assets. Low commodity prices fueled the acquisitions and more may be on the way, Blackmont analysts said. Crude for October delivery ended down $2.32, or 3.1%, at $72.05 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. See full story on oil prices. Companies ""appear to be adjusting their longer-term strategies to re-balance gas-weighted portfolios to oil,"" according to the note. Canadian economic outlook The Canadian economy is expected to start growing again this quarter, but a strong dollar might disrupt economic gains, said Bank of Canada's Deputy Governor Timothy Lane. The Bank of Canada may use an unconventional monetary policy called quantitative easing, which means it would purchase government treasuries, in order to hold back the strong dollar, Lane told the Canadian Association of Business Economists on Tuesday. ""Other things being equal, a persistently strong Canadian dollar would reduce real growth and delay the return of inflation to target,"" Lane said. ""Even though we are at the effective lower bound for our policy rate, we retain considerable flexibility through the use of unconventional monetary policy instruments, including quantitative easing."" The recent rise in the dollar is a result of a weakening U.S. dollar and normalizing global financial conditions. He also said ""Canada's relatively well-functioning financial system will enable credit to meet the needs of an expanding economy."" As Canada's recession nears an end, the Toronto Stock Exchange remains buoyed by better-than-expected earnings, countering the negative effects of early jitters ""over whether consumers in the U.S. and Canada can sustain a true expansion,"" said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist at CIBC World Markets Inc. in an economics insight report released Tuesday, prior to Lane's speech. Nearly 80% of the TSX's heavyweights have already posted earnings for the most recent term. Insurer-dominated non-bank financials and materials sectors topped pre-season expectations by an average of 21% and 14%, respectively, according to the report. The energy sector fared the worst and dropped below expectations by 9%. In other economic news, Canada's statistics agency said Tuesday that in June, 816,600 people received regular employment insurance benefits, up 5.1% from a month earlier. ""There are compelling signs that labor conditions are beginning to turn, but sustainable job growth remains a somewhat distant prospect,"" said Eric Lascelles, a chief economist at TD Securities in a note about the report. Positive U.S. Data In the U.S., the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% advanced 0.4% to 1,029, lifted by a survey that showed consumer confidence rose in August, with individuals' expectations about the future the most optimistic since the recession began. See full story on U.S. stocks. The Conference Board reported its Consumer Price Index rose to 54.1 in August from an upwardly revised 47.4 in July based on a survey of 5,000 U.S. households. Economists surveyed by MarketWatch expected the index to rise to 48. See full story on confidence index. The Canadian dollar fell. One U.S. dollar bought C$1.0858 compared to C$1.0802 early Tuesday.
