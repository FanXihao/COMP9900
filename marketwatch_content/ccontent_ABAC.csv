ABAC,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (""MD&A"") The following discussion and analysis of our Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements. Overview Our Company is in the business of breeding, raising, and selling hogs in the Wuhan City area of the PRC, and distributes specialty processed black hog products through supermarkets and other outlets and direct to consumers via the internet. In an effort to significantly increase the scale of our operations, in 2012 we concluded the Exclusivity Agreements, whereby we were granted the exclusive right to breed and sell Enshi black hogs in Enshi Autonomous Prefecture in Hubei Province. The agreements call for the joint development, funding and operation of local cooperatives in the Enshi Autonomous Prefecture in Hubei Province whereby the Company, the relevant governmental agencies and the cooperatives will assist participating farmers to breed and raise Enshi black hogs which will be purchased by the Company for resale as meat hogs or retained or sold as breeders at the Company's discretion. This program allows us to profit from the black hogs grown by the participating farmers who purchase feed, vaccines and other supplies from us and then sell us their hogs at a price which is comparable to the costs at which we currently grow our own hogs. Table of Contents By the end of the first quarter of 2014 we had funded and completed the construction of 798 farms for local farmers when we decided to stop providing capital to the program and focus on our black hog retail operations. Due to the extensive damages suffered by 172 farms as a result of July's record rainfall in Wuhan, the cooperation agreements with 172 damaged small-scale hog farms were terminated. In July 2014, our management determined to diversify our operations by acquiring various emerging high technology companies. In accordance with such plan, in July 2014, we acquired 88% of the equity of Hang-ao for consideration of $9,055,605, including RMB 42 million or approximately $6.8 million in cash and 261,750 of our common shares. In addition, in August 2014, we and consummated a stock purchase agreement whereby we acquired 95% of the outstanding equity of OV Orange. However, in early 2015, due to disruptions in the Chinese economy we reconsidered this strategy. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined to focus on the Agricultural industry and sell Hang-ao and OV Orange. In December 2015, we sold our 95% of the equity of OV Orange for RMB 47.5 million or approximately $7.3 million in cash, as a condition of the sale, the 100,750 ""earn-out"" shares deposited in escrow and issued to Mr. Hai Liu, CEO and the former beneficial owner of OV Orange were released to him at the end of March, 2017 as previously stipulated in the acquisition agreement. On December 23, 2016, we completed equity transfer agreements with Zhongbicheng Holdings Co., Ltd. for the sale of our 88% equity interest in Hang-ao for a purchase price of RMB 26 million ($3.9 million). For the 2016 the operating results of Hang-ao, were reflected in the Company's financial statements as discontinued operations. Principal Factors Affecting our Results of Operations Revenues In our hog farming segment, we derive the bulk of our revenues from the sale of hogs to other hog farms for breeding purposes, to brokers who sell our hogs both to other hog farms for breeding purposes and to slaughterhouses, and directly to slaughterhouses. We breed and raise hogs that are eventually sold as either breeder or market hogs which will be sold to slaughter houses for conversion into pork products. Some hogs are bred and raised for sale as market hogs, while others become market hogs because customers do not select them as breeder hogs. As very few boars are required for breeding purposes, and approximately half of a litter will be males, most males are sold as market hogs. The average sales price for a breeder is significantly higher than that of a market hog, and since breeder hogs are sold at a younger age than market hogs and usually weigh about 110 pounds at the date they are sold, as compared to the average weight of about 220 pounds for a market hog on sale date, the direct cost of feeding and otherwise raising a breeder hog is less than a market hog. Thus, the gross margin for breeder hogs is substantially higher than that of market hogs. Consequently, the Company has focused its operations to increase the proportion of its sales represented by breeder hogs, and its success in so doing has been a major contributor to its operating profit. In our retail segment, we generate our revenues from selling black hog meat products through supermarkets and other direct sale outlets, and direct to consumers via the internet. We receive subsidies from the government for operating our farms, as well as financial support from the government for some of our research projects. Some of these subsidies are non-recurring, such as the payment we receive when farms reach specified annual production capacities, for the acquisition of certain operating equipment, or for specific research projects. Others, such as subsidies for breeder hog insurance, are ongoing so long as we qualify. Of course, there is no assurance the government will continue any of its policies for granting subsidies. Table of Contents Factors Affecting Revenues and Profitability The following factors, among others, affect the revenues and profitability that we derive from our operations. Consumer demand for pork products. Consumer demand for pork products is closely linked to the performance of the general Chinese economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in consumer demand may occur as a result of adverse general economic conditions. Lower consumer confidence and changes in consumer preferences for pork as compared with other meats can lower the revenues and profitability of our operations. As a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject our revenues to volatility. Revenues resulting from the sale of breeder hogs. A significant amount of our revenues and operating margin result from the sale of young breeder hogs for use by other hog farmers. Because these breeder hogs command a price significantly higher than market hogs, and are sold at a younger age, thus incurring less feed and related finishing expenses, the profitability of the sale of a breeder hog is higher than that for the sale of a market hog. A significant reduction in the proportion of our sales that are breeder hogs would very likely significantly reduce our overall profit margin. Government action in our industry. Because pork occupies such a central role in the Chinese diet, the government has occasionally taken action to prevent the price of pork from dropping below specified levels and has provided subsidies to companies engaged in hog farming. We benefit from this protection, and we could be harmed if the government terminated such practices. In addition, the government has taken actions to prevent the spread of diseases among livestock, including mandatory culls of affected animals. These actions have occasionally resulted in relative shortages, which tend to lead to higher prices for healthy animals, and could result in a reduction of our stock, thus reducing revenues and profit. Likewise it is possible that the government could implement some form of price controls that adversely impact our ability to price our products so as to recover increases in costs such as feed. Competition and subsidies. While the hog farming industry in Hubei province and the Wuhan City area includes a large number of farms, many of those farms are smaller farms that sell relatively few hogs per year. We believe the incentives being given to farms that reach specified annual production capacities are likely to result in a consolidation of the industry. Our ability to increase our production capacity and thus to qualify for these incentives for our operations allows us to receive non-recurrent benefits from these subsidies, as well as to benefit from increased economies of scale in our operations. Expansion. We believe we must further strengthen our livestock business by developing more diversified retail channels or developing our own pork processing business. If we fail to develop more diversified retail channels or create our own pork processing business, our revenue growth could slow. Epidemic outbreaks. The outbreak of animal diseases could adversely affect our revenues. An occurrence of serious animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, or any outbreak of other epidemics in the PRC affecting animals or humans might result in material disruptions to our sales. Taxes. We believe that the provisions of the PRC's Enterprise Income Tax law currently provide our hog breeding operations with an exemption from PRC income taxes, VAT taxes and business service taxes. If this understanding is incorrect or if the law or interpretations of the law change, this could significantly impact the Company's net operating results. Costs and Expenses We primarily incur the following costs and expenses: Costs of goods sold.In raising hogs for sale, we incur a number of costs that represent the costs of goods sold. We must purchase hog feed, premix components, medicines and other supplies to grow our hogs and keep them healthy. In addition to these items, cost of goods sold includes expenses such as the amortization of the sows (referred to as biological assets), farm employee wages, water, electricity, equipment depreciation expense, maintenance expense, quarantine expense, equipment costs, insurance expense, and sewage charges. Table of Contents General and administrative expenses. General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff, professional fees (including consulting, audit and legal fees), communication costs, research and development costs, gasoline, welfare expenses, education expenses, travel and business hospitality expenses, land rent, and other office administrative and related expenses. Sales and marketing costs. Sales and marketing costs include salaries, wages, and promotion expenses. Factors Affecting Expenses Supplies and commodity prices. The largest component of our expenses relates to the price of materials required to breed and raise hogs for sale. Specifically, while we ordinarily breed our own hogs, we periodically purchase breeding stock to improve our genetic breeding pool. Similarly, the prices of corn and soybean husks in China are important to our operations, because corn and soybean husks are the primary component of the hogs' diet. To the extent the prices of these materials vary, our cost of goods will fluctuate, and we may not be able to recover higher costs by charging higher prices for our products. For this reason, we may be affected by droughts, floods, crop diseases and the like, which tend to make feed scarcer and thus more expensive. Number of customers.The more customers we have, the greater the likelihood that related selling expenses, travel expenses and other similar costs will increase. At present, we sell substantially all of our hogs to a relatively small number of customers. We believe this concentration of customers in our hog sales has allowed us to focus our marketing and selling efforts. Number of farms we operate. We have acquired or constructed a number of hog farms, and may acquire additional hog farms in the future. As we operate more farms, our administrative expenses tend to increase in dollars terms. Retail expenses.As we pursue a strategy of providing our branded product to retail outlets, we expect that we will face additional costs such as promotion and advertising expenses to establish our brand image and retail recognition. Results of Operations The results of operations of Hang-ao, were reclassified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 based on the Company's decision to focus on the hog industry and the sale of Hang-ao on December 23, 2016.

Year Ended December 31, 2017 Hog Farming Retail Total Revenues $ 24,429 $ 2,575 $ 27,004 Cost of goods sold $ 21,016 $ 1,739 $ 22,755 Gross profit $ 3,413 $ 836 $ 4,249 Gross margin % 14 % 32 % 16 % Year Ended December 31, 2016 Hog Farming Retail Total Revenues $ 31,449 $ 2,248 $ 33,697 Cost of goods sold $ 25,630 $ 1,660 $ 27,290 Gross profit $ 5,819 $ 588 $ 6,407 Gross margin % 19 % 26 % 19 %  Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2017, we had revenues of $27,003,803, as compared to revenues of $33,697,680 for 2016. Our revenues decreased by $6,693,877 or 19.86%. This reduction in revenues is continuing to reflect the impact from the ongoing weak demand for regular breeder hogs, which also reduces prices for regular hogs and black hogs, and the reduction in the number of black hogs available for sale after the 2016 flood damage. From the trends we saw, during the past 12 months, the demand for regular breeder hogs has slightly increased, even though demand has not recovered to the levels of 2016. In addition, the prices of market hogs, including regular hogs and black hogs, started to decrease in the fourth quarter of 2016 and only stopped falling at end of the third quarter of 2017. Since then, prices have improved only marginally. Table of Contents The tables below illustrate our sales of breeder hogs, market hogs, black hogs and specialty pork products for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016.  Revenues by Products Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 No. of Hogs No. of Hogs Sold Average Price/Hog Sales Sold Average Price/Hog Sales Breeder Hogs - regular hogs 14,801 $ 249 $ 3,692,596 15,957 $ 249 $ 3,966,831 Market Hogs - regular hogs 76,218 $ 154 11,715,519 60,808 $ 220 13,393,781 Market Hogs - black hogs 43,142 $ 209 9,020,589 50,595 $ 278 14,088,641 Total 134,161 $ 182 $ 24,428,704 127,360 $ 247 $ 31,449,253 Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Kilogram Average Price/kg Sales Kilogram Average Price/kg Sales Market Hogs - specialty black hog pork products 523,472 $ 5 $ 2,575,099 462,499 $ 5 $ 2,248,427 Total 523,472 $ 5 $ 2,575,099 462,499 $ 5 $ 2,248,427  As can be seen from the above, the number of ""regular breeder hogs"" and ""black market hogs"" sold decreased 7% and 15% year over year. As the average price per hog changed 0% and 25%, respectively, our revenues from the sale of regular breeder hogs and black market hogs decreased $274,235 and $5,068,052. As also can be seen from the above, during the year ended December 31, 2017 the number of regular market hogs sold increased 25% from the number sold in 2016, but the average price per hog decreased 30% year over year. During the year ended December 31, 2017, 523,472 kilograms of black hog meat were used to produce specialty pork products sold in our retail business a 13% increase compared to the prior year. This increase in volume, along with a consistent selling price for our specialty pork products resulted in an improvement in our revenues year over year. Cost of goods sold. For the year ended December 31, 2017, cost of goods sold was $22,755,339 as compared to $27,290,471 for 2016, a decrease of $4,535,132, or 16.62%. The decrease in cost of goods sold primarily results from lower sales volume of our black market hogs during the period which decreased $5,013,792. Meanwhile, to efficiently control our production costs during the downtrend cycle, we were pushing the sales of our regular market hogs, especially the older ones, which can improve our inventory turnover rate and reduce relevant inventory maintenance cost but in the short term the related cost of goods sold would increase accordingly. The cost related to our regular market hogs increased $806,767 during the year of 2017. Table of Contents Profit Margins. Our gross margin decreased to 16% in the year ended December 31, 2017 from 19% in 2016. Our gross profit was $4,248,464 for 2017 as compared to $6,407,209 for 2016. This decrease of $2,158,745 in our gross profit reflected a decrease in gross profit of approximately $2.4 million in our Hog Farming segment, especially in our regular market hogs. Our gross margins from our Hog Farming and Retail segments were 13% and 32%, respectively, in 2017 as compared to 19% and 26% in 2016. The reduction in our gross profit from our Hog Farming segment was primarily the result of the reduced selling prices for regular market hogs which decreased 30% year over year. Even with efforts to sell 25% more regular market hogs, we still faced a reduction of $1.7 million in regular market hog sales. Additionally, to control our hog maintenance cost, we pushed the sales of older regular market hogs which increased our costs $0.8 million. As a result of the combination of both factors, the margin from our regular market hogs reduced approximately $2.5 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $773,356 in 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of a decrease of $0.3 million in stock based compensation and a decrease of $0.3 million in our payroll and office expense. Net Other Expense. We had a net other income of $46,138 during the year 2017, compared to a net expense of $1,506,972 in 2016, an increase of $1,553,110, which was primarily due to the extreme weather impact which caused damages at our facilities at $1,670,820 in the year 2016. Income Taxes.Our Hog Farming and Retail segments are exempt from the Chinese income tax and VAT. Net Income. Our net income from continuing operations was $1,108,798 and $941,077 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The increase of approximately $0.2 million year over year was largely due to the loss from flood damage occurred in 2016 and reduced demand for our regular market hogs. Our net income (loss) for 2017 and 2016 was $1,108,798 and ($2,137,669), respectively. The net loss for 2016 was the result of the loss of $3,149,566 incurred in our discontinued operations. We sold Hang-ao on December 23, 2016, completing the divestiture of our discontinued operations. Liquidity and Capital Resources Liquidity is the ability of a company to generate funds to support its current and future operations, satisfy its obligations and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis. At December 31, 2017 our working capital was $65,116,423 as compared to $57,497,640 at December 31, 2016. These funds are deposited in financial institutions located as follows:  December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Country Dollar % Dollar % United States $ - - $ - -  Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows Year Ended December 31, 2017 2016 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 5,212,475 $ 10,047,286 Net cash used in investing activities (103,676 ) (1,242,258 ) Net cash used in financing activities (592,435 ) (301,069 ) Exchange rate effect on cash 3,662,094 (3,702,830 ) Net cash inflow $ 8,178,458 $ 4,801,129  Table of Contents Cash Provided by Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $5,212,475. Cash flow pertaining to operating activities benefited from non-cash expenditures, including depreciation and amortization of $3.0 million, amortization of prepaid expenses and long-term prepaid expenses of $134,396 and $105,097. Additionally, we had a decrease in inventory of $0.8 million. Net cash provided by operating activities in the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $10,047,286. Cash flow pertaining to operating activities from continuing operations benefited from non-cash expenditures, including depreciation and amortization of $2,898,610, amortization of prepaid expenses and long-term prepaid expenses of $242,304 and $106,818, a grant of stock to key employees of $313,438, and a $2,496,892 loss from flood damage. In addition, we had a reduction in accounts receivables of $222,995 and a decrease in inventory of $3,972,673, were partially offset by an increase of $217,380 in prepaid expenses and a decrease of $1,398,591 in other payables. Cash Used in Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2017 totaled $103,676. This was mainly from the purchase of biological assets. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $1,242,258 which included a repayment of $2.1 million for prior year loans from Hang-ao and capital investments of $2,960,399 in fixed asset for upgrading hog farms partially offset by cash consideration of $3,913,894 received for selling Hang-ao. Cash Used in Financing Activities For the year ended December 31, 2017, net cash used in financing activities was $592,435. This was comprised of repayments of short-term loans of $2,665,956, partly offset by the proceeds of $2,073,521 in short-term loans. For the year ended December 31, 2016, we used net cash of $301,069 in financing activities. We received $9.0 million of previously restricted cash from banks and proceeds from renewed short-term loans of $2,709,619. These favorable factors were offset by the repayment of $12,042,752 in short-term loans. Commitments for Capital Expenditures Our anticipated capital requirements for the next twelve months relate to purchasing breeder hogs as well as additional investment in our retail segment to expand our marketing and distribution channels. We also expect to incur modest expenses in maintaining our hog farms. We believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations and Off Balance Sheet Items Contractual Obligations We have certain fixed contractual obligations that include future estimated payments. Changes in our business needs, cancellation provisions, changing interest rates, and other factors may result in actual payments differing from the estimates.

This program allows us to profit from the black hogs grown by the participating farmers who purchase feed, vaccines and other supplies from us and then sell us their hogs at a price which is comparable to the costs at which we currently grow our own hogs. Table of Contents By the end of the first quarter of 2014 we had funded and completed the construction of 798 farms for local farmers. After providing the financing necessary for completion of the construction for 798 farms, we decided to stop providing capital to the program and focus on our black hog retail operations. Due to the extensive damages suffered by 172 farms as a result of record rainfall in Wuhan last July, the cooperation agreements with 172 damaged small-scale hog farms were terminated. In July 2014, our management determined to diversify our operations by acquiring various emerging high technology companies. In accordance with such plan, in July 2014, we acquired 88% of the equity of Hang-ao for consideration of $9,055,605, including RMB 42 million or approximately $6.8 million in cash and 261,750 of our common shares. In addition, in August 2014, we consummated a stock purchase agreement whereby we acquired 95% of the outstanding equity of OV Orange for consideration of 638,000 of the Company's common shares. However, in early 2015, due to disruptions in the Chinese economy we began to reconsider this strategy. In the fourth quarter of 2015, we determined to focus on the Agricultural industry and sell Hang-ao and OV Orange. In December 2015, we sold our 95% of the equity of OV Orange for RMB 47.5 million or approximately $7.3 million in cash, as a condition of the sale, the 100,750 ""earn-out"" shares deposited in escrow and issued to Mr. Hai Liu, CEO and the former beneficial owner of OV Orange would be released to him at the end of March, 2017 as previously stipulated in the acquisition agreement. On December 23, 2016, we completed equity transfer agreements with Zhongbicheng Holdings Co., Ltd. for the sale of our 88% equity interest in Hang-ao for a selling price of RMB 26 million ($3.9 million). For 2016, the operating results of Hang-ao, were reflected in the Company's financial statements as discontinued operations. Principal Factors Affecting our Results of Operations Revenues In our hog farming segment, we derive the bulk of our revenues from the sale of hogs to other hog farms for breeding purposes, to brokers who sell our hogs both to other hog farms for breeding purposes and to slaughterhouses, and directly to slaughterhouses. We breed and raise hogs that are eventually sold as either breeder or market hogs which will be sold to slaughterhouses for conversion into pork products. Some of the hogs are bred and raised for sale as market hogs, while others become market hogs because customers do not select them as breeder hogs. Also very few boars are required for breeding purposes, so most males are sold as market hogs. The average sales price for a breeder is significantly higher than that of a market hog, and since breeder hogs are sold at a younger age than market hogs and usually weigh about 110 pounds at the date they are sold, as compared to the average weight of about 220 pounds for a market hog on sale date, the direct cost of feeding and otherwise raising a breeder hog is less than a market hog. Thus, the gross margin for breeder hogs is substantially higher than that of market hogs. Consequently, we have structured our operations to increase the proportion of sales represented by breeder hogs, and our success in so doing has been a major contribution to its operating profit. In our retail segment, we generate our revenues from selling black hog meat products through supermarkets, other direct sale outlets and the internet. We receive subsidies from the government for operating our farms, as well as financial support from the government for some of our research projects. Some of these subsidies are non-recurring, such as the payment we receive when farms reach specified annual production capacities, for the acquisition of certain operating equipment, or for specific research projects. Others, such as subsidies for breeder hog insurance, are ongoing so long as we qualify. Of course, there is no assurance the government will continue any of its policies for granting subsidies. Factors Affecting Revenues and Profitability The following factors, among others, affect the revenues and profitability that we derive from our operations. Table of Contents Consumer demand for pork products. Consumer demand for pork products is closely linked to the performance of the general Chinese economy and is sensitive to business and personal discretionary spending levels. Declines in consumer demand may occur as a result of adverse general economic conditions. Lower consumer confidence and changes in consumer preferences for pork as compared with other meats can lower the revenues and profitability of our operations. As a result, changes in consumer demand and general business cycles can subject our revenues to volatility. Revenues resulting from the sale of breeder hogs. A significant amount of our revenues and operating margin result from the sale of young breeder hogs for use by other hog farmers. Because these breeder hogs command a price significantly higher than market hogs, and are sold at a younger age, thus incurring less feed and related finishing expenses, the profitability of the sale of a breeder hog is higher than that for the sale of a market hog. A significant reduction in the proportion of our sales that are breeder hogs would very likely significantly reduce our overall profit margin. Government action in our industry. Because pork occupies such a central role in the Chinese diet, the government has occasionally taken action to prevent the price of pork from dropping below specified levels and has provided subsidies to companies engaged in hog farming. We benefit from this protection, and we could be harmed if the government terminated such practices. In addition, the government has taken actions to prevent the spread of diseases among livestock, including mandatory culls of affected animals. These actions have occasionally resulted in relative shortages, which tend to lead to higher prices for healthy animals, and could result in a reduction of our stock, thus reducing revenues and profit. Likewise it is possible that the government could implement some form of price controls that adversely impact our ability to price our products so as to recover increases in costs such as feed. Competition and subsidies. While the hog farming industry in Hubei province and the Wuhan City area includes a large number of farms, many of those farms are smaller farms that sell relatively few hogs per year. We believe the incentives being given to farms that reach specified annual production capacities are likely to result in a consolidation of the industry. Our ability to increase our production capacity and thus to qualify for these incentives for our operations allows us to receive non-recurrent benefits from these subsidies, as well as to benefit from increased economies of scale in our operations. Expansion. We believe we must further strengthen our livestock business by developing more diversified retail channels or developing our own pork processing business. If we fail to develop more diversified retail channels or create our own pork processing business, our revenue growth could slow. Epidemic outbreaks. The outbreak of animal diseases could adversely affect our revenues. An occurrence of serious animal diseases, such as foot-and-mouth disease, or any outbreak of other epidemics in the PRC affecting animals or humans might result in material disruptions to our sales. Taxes. We believe that the provisions of the PRC's Enterprise Income Tax law currently provide our hog breeding operations with an exemption from PRC income taxes, VAT taxes and business service taxes. If this understanding is incorrect or if the law or interpretations of the law change, this could significantly impact the Company's net operating results. Costs and Expenses We primarily incur the following costs and expenses: Costs of goods sold. In raising hogs for sale, we incur a number of costs that represent the costs of goods sold. We must purchase hog feed, premix components, medicines and other supplies to grow our hogs and keep them healthy. In addition to these items, cost of goods sold includes expenses such as the amortization of the sows (referred to as biological assets), farm employee wages, water, electricity, equipment depreciation expense, maintenance expense, quarantine expense, equipment costs, insurance expense, and sewage charges. Table of Contents General and administrative expenses.General and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation expense for our corporate staff, professional fees (including consulting, audit and legal fees), communication costs, research and development costs, gasoline, welfare expenses, education expenses, travel and business hospitality expenses, land rent, and other office administrative and related expenses. Sales and marketing costs. Sales and marketing costs include salaries, wages, and promotion expenses. Factors Affecting Expenses Supplies and commodity prices. The largest component of our expenses relates to the price of materials required to breed and raise hogs for sale. Specifically, while we ordinarily breed our own hogs, we periodically purchase breeding stock to improve our genetic breeding pool. Similarly, the prices of corn and soybean husks in China are important to our operations, because corn and soybean husks are the primary component of the hogs' diet. To the extent the prices of these materials vary, our cost of goods will fluctuate, and we may not be able to recover higher costs by charging higher prices for our products. For this reason, we may be affected by droughts, floods, crop diseases and the like, which tend to make feed scarcer and thus more expensive. Number of customers. The more customers we have, the greater the likelihood that related selling expenses, travel expenses and other similar costs will increase. At present, we sell substantially all of our hogs to a relatively small number of customers. We believe this concentration of customers in our hog sales has allowed us to focus our marketing and selling efforts. Number of farms we operate. We have acquired or constructed a number of hog farms. As we operate more farms, our administrative expenses tend to increase in dollars terms. Retail expenses. As we pursue a strategy of providing our branded product to retail outlets, we expect that we will face additional costs such as promotion and advertising expenses to establish our brand image and retail recognition. In connection with the Enshi Black Hog program, we have agreed to incur various costs and contribute various amounts to cover the costs of different aspects of the program. Since 2011, we signed 7 joint development agreements, generally for periods of 10 years, whereby the Company, the relevant governmental agencies and the cooperatives will assist participating farmers to breed and raise Enshi black hogs which will be purchased by us for resale as meat hogs or retained or sold as breeders at our discretion. Under these agreements, we provided funding to local independent farmers to construct small-scale hog rearing facilities on which the farmers grow black hogs for sale to us. Pursuant to these joint development agreements, title to these small-scale hog rearing facilities belongs to us and the local cooperatives (and the individual farmers) have the right to use them. We have constructed or purchased $11.24 million dollars of hog rearing facilities and equipment that has been completed and is operational and included in plant and equipment. After providing the financing necessary for completion of the construction for 798 farms, we decided to temporarily stop providing capital to the program and focus on our black hog retail operations. The heavy rainfall in Wuhan in July 2016 damaged a number of these farms and as the result, the cooperation agreements with 172 damaged small-scale hog farms were terminated. Results of Operations The results of operations of Hang-ao, were reclassified as discontinued operations in the Company's financial statements for the three months and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 based on the Company's decision to focus on the hog industry and the sale of Hang-ao on December 23, 2016.

Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 Hog Farming Retail Total Revenues $ 11,535 $ 1,368 $ 12,903 Cost of goods sold $ 10,216 $ 914 $ 11,130 Gross profit $ 1,319 $ 454 $ 1,773 Gross margin % 11 % 33 % 14 % Six Months Ended June 30, 2016 Hog Farming Retail Total Revenues $ 17,871 $ 799 $ 18,670 Cost of goods sold $ 13,791 $ 600 $ 14,391 Gross profit $ 4,080 $ 199 $ 4,279 Gross margin % 23 % 25 % 23 %  Revenues. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, we had revenues of $12,903,151, as compared to revenues of $18,670,057 for the same period of 2016. Our revenues decreased by $5,766,906 or approximately 30.89%. This reduction in revenues is continuing to reflect the impacts from the ongoing weak demand for regular breeder hogs, which also reduces prices for regular hogs and black hogs, and the reduction in the number of black hogs available for sale after the 2016 flood damage. The tables below illustrate our sales of breeder hogs, market hogs, black hogs and specialty pork products for the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016.  Sales by Products Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 No. of Hogs Sold Average Price/Hog Sales No. of Hogs Sold Average Price/Hog Sales Breeder Hogs- regular hogs 6,181 $ 246 $ 1,522,951 8,436 $ 253 $ 2,132,712 Market Hogs- regular hogs 34,716 $ 156 5,427,267 31,890 $ 229 7,307,227 Market Hogs- black hogs 21,499 $ 213 4,584,726 28,620 $ 295 8,430,820 Total 62,396 $ 185 $ 11,534,944 68,946 $ 259 $ 17,870,759  Table of Contents  Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 Kilogram Average Price/kg Sales Kilogram Average Price/kg Sales Market Hogs-specialty black hog pork products 274,804 $ 5 $ 1,368,207 167,752 $ 5 $ 799,298 Total 274,804 $ 5 $ 1,368,207 167,752 $ 5 $ 799,298  As can be seen from the above, the number of ""regular breeder hogs"" and ""black market hogs"" sold decreased 27% and 25% in the year over year period. As the average price per hog decreased 3% and 28%, respectively, our revenues from the sale of regular breeder hogs and black market hogs decreased $609,761 and $3,846,094. As also can be seen from the above, during the six months ended June 30, 2017 the number of regular market hogs sold slightly increased from the number sold in 2016, but the average price per hog decreased 32% year over year. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2016, hog prices in China began a downtrend cycle mainly as a result of increasing numbers of large state owned companies and Chinese publicly listed companies engaged in the hog farming industry which brought pressure on hog and pork prices and inflated feed supply costs. We anticipate that the growth in the number of large well capitalized farms will increase competitive pressures on small and mid-size hog farms. As the result, the numbers of small or mid-size hog farms may be reduced which directly affects the demands for our breeder hogs. In addition, the 2016 flood brought significant damage to the area where hogs are raised in Enshi from which the local farmers have not recovered which continued to limit the number of black market hogs available for sale. During the six months ended June 30, 2017, 274,804 kilograms of black hog meat were used to produce specialty pork products sold in our retail business a 64% increase from the comparable period of the prior year. This increase in volume coupled with stable prices for specialty pork products resulted in a 71% year over year increase in our revenues. Cost of goods sold. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, cost of goods sold was $11,130,023 as compared to $14,390,715 for the same period of 2016, a decrease of $3,260,692, or 22.66%. The decrease in cost of goods sold primarily results from lower sale volume during the period, which was partly offset by increased feed costs. Profit Margins. Our gross margin decreased to 14% in the six months ended June 30, 2017 from 23% in 2016. Our gross profit was $1,773,128 for 2017 as compared to $4,279,342 for 2016. This decrease in our gross profit reflected a decrease in gross profit of approximately $2.8 million in our Hog Farming segment, especially in our regular market hogs. Our gross margins from our Hog Farming and Retail segments were 11% and 33%, respectively, in the first six months of 2017 as compared to 23% and 25% in the comparable period of 2016. The reduction in our gross margin from our Hog Farming segment was due to the increase in the numbers of large regular market hogs, over 100 kilograms per hog, sold during the period coupled with a decrease in the number of breeder hogs sold. Large hogs normally require more feed to maintain their daily diet and are sold to pork dealers directly. During the first half year of 2017, we sold more large regular market hogs to pork dealers than the same period in 2016. However, the reduced sale prices of regular market hogs and increased feed costs for maintaining large market hogs caused our gross margin to decrease. The improvement in our gross profit from the Retail segment was primarily the result of higher sale prices charged to our new customer and an increase in sales volume. Table of Contents Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased by $386,938 during the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of cost control over employee payrolls. Net Other Income. We had net other income of $13,705 during the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to $150,114 in the same period of 2016, a decrease of $136,409, which was primarily due to an increase of $72,817 in interest expense. Income Taxes. As an agricultural business, we are exempt from the Chinese income tax and our hog farming operations are exempt from VAT. With respect to our wholesale operations, we are engaged in breeding, processing, and distributing black hogs and black hog meats which are exempt from VAT taxes and corporate income tax as well. Net Income. Our net income for the first six months of 2017 and 2016 was $97,516 and $330,997, respectively. Our net income from continuing operations, our Hog Farming segment, showed significant recession with a decrease of $2.5 million year over year. However, at the same time, we saw a continuing improvement of $300,000 from our Retail segment. The operating results of our discontinued operations, Hang-ao, generated a significant net loss of $2,022,204 in the first half year of 2016.

ABAC,"WUHAN CITY, China, March 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Renmin Tianli Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: ABAC) (""Renmin Tianli"" or the ""Company""), a producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, with headquarters in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, today announced its financial results for the three and twelve months ended December 31, 2017. Mr. Luchang Zhou, Chief Executive Officer of Renmin Tianli, commented, ""We saw a moderate increase of 1.7% in total revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 as a result of 31.7% growth in the number of hogs sold from our hog farming business, which was partially offset by a decrease in the blended average selling price per hog as well as a decrease in retail sales volume. Gross and operating margins and net income all improved significantly in the fourth quarter of 2017, as we continued to improve our inventory turnover rate and reduce our employee payroll. Looking ahead, we expect the hog farming industry to continue to face significant uncertainty in market demand and high volatilities in both hog pricing and feed costs.""

The increase in overall revenues was due to an increase in revenues from regular hog sales partially offset by a decrease in revenues from our black hog program. Revenues from hog farming, which includes sales of regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs, and black hogs, increased by $0.43 million, or 6.9%, to $6.69 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $6.25 million for the same period of last year. The Company sold a total of 36,751 regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs and black hogs with a blended average selling price of $182 per hog during the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to 27,914 hogs sold and a blended average selling price of $224 per hog for the same period of last year.

Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 from regular market hog sales increased by 11.5% to $3.27 million as the number of regular market hogs sold increased by 46.5% to 21,524 hogs while the average selling price of regular market hogs decreased by 23.9% to $152 per hog. Revenues for the fourth quarter of 2017 from black market hogs decreased by 6.4% to $2.24 million with the number of black hogs sold increasing by 12.9% to 10,569 hogs and the average selling price of black hogs decreasing by 17.1% to $212 per hog. We sold 127,637 kilograms of specialty black hog pork products through retail at approximately $5 per kilogram, generating revenues of $0.62 million for the fourth quarter of 2017. This compared to186,357 kilograms sold at approximately $5 per kilogram and revenues of $0.93 million for the same period of last year. These revenues, combined with the sales of black market hogs, led to $2.86 million in revenues from our black hog program for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $3.33 million for the same period of last year. Gross profit Cost of goods sold increased by $0.05 million, or 0.9%, to $5.97 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $5.92 million for the same period of last year. Cost of goods sold for hog farming increased by $0.29 million, or 5.4%, to $5.53 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $5.25 million for the same period of last year. Cost of goods sold for retail decreased by $0.23 million, or 34.7%, to $0.44 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $0.67 million for the same period of last year. Overall gross profit increased by $0.07 million, or 5.6%, to $1.34 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $1.27 million for the same period of last year. This increase in our gross profit was primarily related to an increase in gross profit of $0.15 million, or 15.0%, for our hog farming segment and partially offset by a decrease in gross profit of $0.08 million, or 29.5%, for retail. Gross profit for hog farming and retail were $1.15 million and $0.19 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $1.00 million and $0.27 million, respectively, for the same period of last year. Overall gross margin was 18.3%, with gross margins for hog farming and retail of 17.2% and 30.3%, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2017. This compared to overall gross margin of 17.7%, and gross margins for hog farming and retail of 16.0% and 28.7%, respectively, for the same period of last year. Operating income Total operating expenses, including general and administrative expenses and selling and marketing expenses, decreased by $0.21 million, or 22.1%, to $0.73 million for the fourth quarter of 2017 from $0.93 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was primarily the result of cost control over employee payrolls. Operating income for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.61 million, compared to an operating loss of $0.34 million for the same period of last year. Operating margin for the fourth quarter of 2017 was 8.4%, compared to 4.7% for the same period of last year. Net income Net income increased by $0.26 million, or 71.7%, to $0.63 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.36 million for the same period of last year. Our net income from continuing operations, including both hog farming and retail, was $0.63 million for the fourth quarter of 2017, compared to $0.37 million for the same period of last year. Net income for the fourth quarter of 2016 was adversely impacted by the net loss from our discontinued operation, Hang-ao, which was $6,215 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Hang-ao was sold on December 23, 2016. After the deduction for non-controlling interests, net income attributable to common shareholders for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $0.63 million, compared to net loss of $0.38 million for the same period of last year.

The reduction in revenues reflected the impact from the ongoing weak demand for regular breeder hogs, which also reduced prices for regular hogs and black hogs, and the reduction in the number of black hogs available for sale after the 2016 flood damage. Revenues from hog farming, which includes sales of regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs, and black hogs, decreased by $7.02 million, or 22.3%, to $24.43 million for 2017 from $31.45 million for 2016. The Company sold a total of 134,161 regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs and black hogs with a blended average selling price of $182 per hog during 2017, compared to 127,360 hogs sold and a blended average selling price of $247 per hog for 2016.

Revenues for 2017 from regular market hog sales decreased by 12.5% to $11.72 million as the number of regular market hogs sold increased by 25.3% to 76,218 hogs while the average selling price of regular market hogs decreased by 30.2% to $154 per hog. Revenues for 2017 from black market hogs decreased by 36.0% to $9.02 million with the number of black hogs sold decreasing by 14.7% to 43,142 hogs and the average selling price of black hogs decreasing by 24.9% to $209 per hog. We sold 523,472 kilograms of specialty black hog pork products through retail at approximately $5 per kilogram, generating revenues of $2.58 million for 2017. This compares to 462,499 kilograms sold at approximately $5 per kilogram and revenues of $2.25 million for 2016. These revenues, combined with the sales of black market hogs, led to $11.60 million in revenues from our black hog program for 2017, compared to $16.34 million for 2016. Gross profit Cost of goods sold decreased by $4.54 million, or 16.6%, to $22.76 million for 2017 from $27.29 million for 2016. Cost of goods sold for hog farming decreased by $4.61 million, or 18.0%, to $21.02 million for 2017 from $25.63 million for 2016. The decrease in cost of goods sold for hog farming was primarily due to the lower sales volume of black market hogs in 2017. Meanwhile, to control our production costs during the downtrend cycle, we sold our regular market hogs at younger ages which improved our inventory turnover rate and reduced relevant inventory maintenance cost. Cost of goods sold for retail increased by $0.08 million, or 4.8%, to $1.74 million for 2017 from $1.66 million for 2016. The increase in cost of goods sold for retail was primarily due to increased sales volume. Overall gross profit decreased by $2.16 million, or 33.7%, to $4.25 million for 2017 from $6.41 million for 2016. This decrease in our gross profit reflected a decrease in gross profit for our hog farming segment partially offset by improvement in gross profit for retail. Gross profits for hog farming and retail were $3.41 million and $0.84 million, respectively, for 2017, compared to $5.82 million and $0.59 million, respectively, for 2016. Overall gross margin was 15.7%, with gross margins for hog farming and retail of 14.0% and 32.5%, respectively, for 2017. This compared to overall gross margin of 19.0%, and gross margins for hog farming and retail of 18.5% and 26.2%, respectively, for 2016. The reduction in our gross margin from our hog farming segment was due to the reduced selling prices for regular market hogs and black market hogs during 2017. During 2017, we sold more large regular market hogs to pork dealers than in 2016. However, the reduced sales prices of regular market hogs and increased feed costs for maintaining large market hogs caused our gross margin to decrease. The improvement in gross profit and gross margin from the retail segment was primarily the result of higher sale prices charged to our new customer and an increase in sales volume. Operating income Total operating expenses, including general and administrative expenses, and selling and marketing expenses, decreased by $0.77 million, or 19.5%, to $3.19 million for 2017 from $3.96 million for 2016. The decrease was primarily the result of cost control over employee payrolls. Operating income for 2017 was $1.06 million, compared to $2.45 million for 2016. Operating margin for 2017 was 3.9%, compared to 7.3% for 2016. Net income (loss) Net income was $1.11 million for 2017, compared to net loss of $2.14 million for 2016. Our net income from continuing operations, including both hog farming and retail, was $1.1 million for 2017, compared to $0.94 million for 2016. Net income for 2016 was adversely impacted by the net loss from our discontinued operation, Hang-ao, which was $3.08 million for 2016. Hang-ao was sold on December 23, 2016. After the deduction for non-controlling interests, net income attributable to common shareholders for 2017 was $1.11 million, compared to net loss of $1.76 million for 2016. Financial Condition As of December 31, 2017, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of $62.64 million, compared to $54.46 million at the end of 2016.

ABAC,"WUHAN CITY, China, Aug. 14, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Aoxin Tianli Group, Inc. ABAC, -3.39% (""Aoxin Tianli"" or the ""Company""), a producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, with headquarters in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, today announced its financial results for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. Mr. Luchang Zhou, Chief Executive Officer of Aoxin Tianli, commented, ""thanks to the continued growth in our retail business, total revenues decreased by only 35.3% to $6.22 million in the second quarter primarily driven by decreases in both the number of hogs sold and the average selling price per hog in our hog farming business. The decrease in the number of hogs sold in our hog farming business was primarily the result of a drop in the number of  regular breeder hogs and black hogs sold as a result of the damages caused by the severe floods in July 2016 that limited the number of hogs available for sale in the second quarter. Hog prices were also not in our favor and further declined sequentially during the second quarter."" Mr. Wocheng Liu, Chairman of Aoxin Tianli, added, ""while we continue to face significant headwinds in the near term, we are pleased to welcome Mr. Zhou and Ms. Qinyu Liu to join our team as Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, respectively. With their significant career accomplishments, Mr. Zhou and Ms. Liu bring tremendous value to Aoxin Tianli as we seek opportunities to take the Company to the next level.""

Revenues from hog farming, which includes sales of regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs, and black hogs, decreased by $3.67 million, or 39.8%, to $5.56 million for the second quarter of 2017 from $9.23 million for the same period of last year. The Company sold a total of 32,179 regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs and black hogs with a blended average selling price of $173 per hog during the second quarter of 2017, compared to 33,834 hogs sold and a blended average selling price of $273 per hog for the same period of last year.

Revenues for the second quarter of 2017 from black market hogs decreased by 50.7% to $2.15 million with the number of black hogs sold decreasing by 20.8% to 10,911 hogs and the average selling price of black hogs decreasing by 37.8% to $197 per hog. We sold 138,123 kilograms of specialty black hog pork products through retail at approximately $5 per kilogram, generating revenues of $0.66 million for the second quarter of 2017. This compares to 80,368 kilograms sold at approximately $5 per kilogram and revenues of $0.38 million for the same period of last year.These revenues, combined with the sales of black market hogs, led to $2.81 million in revenues from our black hog program for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $4.75 million for the same period of last year. Gross profit Cost of goods sold decreased by $2.04 million, or 27.5%, to $5.39 million for the second quarter of 2017 from $7.43 million for the same period of last year. Cost of goods sold for hog farming decreased by $2.20 million, or 30.7%, to $4.95 million for the second quarter of 2017 from $7.15 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in cost of goods sold for hog farming was primarily due to lower sale volume, which was partly offset by increased feed costs. Cost of goods sold for retail increased by $0.15 million, or 52.4%, to $0.44 million for the second quarter of 2017 from $0.29 million for the same period of last year. The increase in cost of goods sold for retail was primarily due to increased sales volume. Overall gross profit decreased by $1.34 million, or 61.7%, to $0.84 million for the second quarter of 2017 from $2.18 million for the same period of last year. This decrease in our gross profit reflected a decrease in gross profit of $1.48 million for our hog farming segment, especially in the sale of our regular market hogs.Gross profits for hog farming and retail were $0.61 million and $0.23 million, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $2.09 million and $0.09 million, respectively, for the same period of last year. Overall gross margin was 13.4%, with gross margins for hog farming and retail of 11.0% and 34.1%, respectively, for the second quarter of 2017. This compared to overall gross margin of 22.7%, and gross margins for hog farming and retail of 22.6% and 24.5%, respectively, for the same period of last year. The reduction in gross margin from hog farming was due to the increase in the number of large regular market hogs, over 100 kilograms per hog, sold during the period coupled with a decrease in the number of breeder hogs sold. Large hogs normally require more feed to maintain their daily diet and are sold to pork dealers directly. Since the beginning of 2017, we sold more large regular market hogs to pork dealers than the same period in 2016. However, the reduced sale prices of regular market hogs and increased feed costs for maintaining large market hogs caused our gross margin to decrease. The improvement in gross profit from the retail segment was primarily the result of higher sale prices charged to our new customer and an increase in sales volume. Operating income Total operating expenses, including general and administrative expenses and selling and marketing expenses, decreased by $0.25 million, or 24.3%, to $0.78 million for the second quarter of 2017 from $1.03 million for the same period of last year. The decrease was primarily the result of cost control over employee payrolls. Operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $0.06 million, compared to $1.15 million for the same period of last year. Operating margin for the second quarter of 2017 was 0.9%, compared to 12.0% for the same period of last year. Net income Net income was $0.06 millionfor the second quarter of 2017, compared to $0.61 million for the same period of last year. Our net income from continuing operations, including both hog farming and retail,was $0.06 million for the second quarter of 2017, compared to $1.22 million for the same period of last year. Net income for the second quarter of 2016 was adversely impacted by the net loss from our discontinued operation, Hang-ao, which was $0.61 million for the second quarter of 2016. Hang-ao was sold on December 23, 2016. After the deduction for non-controlling interests, net income attributable to common shareholders for the second quarter of 2017 was $0.06 million, compared to $0.68 million for the same period of last year.

The decrease in revenues reflected the impact from the ongoing weak demand for regular breeder hogs, lower prices for regular hogs and black hogs, and fewer black hogs available for sale after the July 2016 flood damage. Revenues from hog farming, which includes sales of regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs, and black hogs, decreased by $6.34 million, or 35.5%, to $11.54 million for the first half of 2017 from $17.87 million for the same period of last year. The Company sold a total of 62,396 regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs and black hogs with a blended average selling price of $185 per hog during the first half of 2017, compared to 68,946 hogs sold and a blended average selling price of $259 per hog for the same period of last year.

Revenues for the first half of 2017 from regular market hog sales decreased by 25.7% to $5.43 million as the number of regular market hogs sold increased by 8.9% to 34,716 hogs while the average selling price of regular market hogs decreased by 31.8% to $156 per hog. Revenues for the first half of 2017 from black market hogs decreased by 45.6% to $4.59 million with the number of black hogs sold decreasing by 24.9% to 21,499 hogs and the average selling price of black hogs decreasing by 27.6% to $213 per hog. We sold 274,804 kilograms of specialty black hog pork products through retail at approximately $5 per kilogram, generating revenues of $1.37 million for the first half of 2017. This compares to 167,752 kilograms sold at approximately $5 per kilogram and revenues of $0.80 million for the same period of last year.These revenues, combined with the sales of black market hogs, led to $5.95 million in revenues from our black hog program for the first half of 2017, compared to $9.23 million for the same period of last year. Gross profit Cost of goods sold decreased by $3.26 million, or 22.7%, to $11.13 million for the first half of 2017 from $14.39 million for the same period of last year. Cost of goods sold for hog farming decreased by $3.58 million, or 25.9%, to $10.22 million for the first half of 2017 from $13.79 million for the same period of last year. The decrease in cost of goods sold for hog farming was primarily due to lower sale volume, which was partly offset by increased feed costs. Cost of goods sold for retail increased by $0.32 million, or 52.5%, to $0.92 million for the first half of 2017 from $0.60 million for the same period of last year. The increase in cost of goods sold for retail was primarily due to increased sales volume. Overall gross profit decreased by $2.51 million, or 58.6%, to $1.77 million for the first half of 2017 from $4.28 million for the same period of last year. This decrease in our gross profit reflected a decrease in gross profit of $2.76 million for our hog farming segment, especially in the sale of our regular market hogs, partially offset by improvement in our retail sales. Gross profits for hog farming and retail were $1.32 million and $0.45 million, respectively, for the first half of 2017, compared to $4.08 million and $0.20 million, respectively, for the same period of last year. Overall gross margin was 13.7%, with gross margins for hog farming and retail of 11.4% and 33.1%, respectively, for the first half of 2017. This compared to overall gross margin of 22.9%, and gross margins for hog farming and retail of 22.8% and 24.9%, respectively, for the same period of last year. The reduction in gross margin from hog farming was due to the increase in the number of large regular market hogs, over 100 kilograms per hog, sold during the period coupled with a decrease in the number of breeder hogs sold. Large hogs normally require more feed to maintain their daily diet and are sold to pork dealers directly. During the first half of 2017, we sold more large regular market hogs to pork dealers than the same period in 2016. However, the reduced sale prices of regular market hogs and increased feed costs for maintaining large market hogs caused our gross margin to decrease.

Operating income for the first half of 2017 was $0.08 million, compared to $2.20 million for the same period of last year. Operating margin for the first half of 2017 was 0.6%, compared to 11.8% for the same period of last year.

Our net income from continuing operations, including both hog farming and retail, was $0.10 million for the first half of 2017, compared to $2.35 million for the same period of last year. Net income for the first half of 2016 was adversely impacted by the net loss from our discontinued operation, Hang-ao, which was $2.02 million for the first half of 2016. Hang-ao was sold on December 23, 2016.

ABAC,"WUHAN, China, May 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Aoxin Tianli Group, Inc. ABAC, -3.39% (""Aoxin Tianli"" or the ""Company""), a producer of breeder hogs, market hogs and black hogs, as well as specialty processed black hog pork products sold through retail outlets and the internet, with headquarters in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. Mr. Wocheng Liu, Chairman and Co-Chief Executive Officer of Aoxin Tianli, commented, ""While our retail business continued to grow benefitting from strong orders from a new online e-commerce customer, our hog farming business declined in the first quarter as a result of decreases in both the number of hogs sold and the average selling price per hog. The decrease in the number of hogs sold was mainly related to our black hog program in Enshi Prefecture where severe floods in July 2016 caused significant damages to our independently operated black hog farms and limited the number of black market hogs available for sale in the first quarter. Additionally, we saw downward trend for hog prices that started in the fourth quarter of 2016 and continued into this year. We believe this was related to the fact that a number of large state owned enterprises and publicly traded companies entered into the hog farming industry. This, combined with the uptick in feed cost in recent months, would continue to put pressure on existing hog farmers, particularly smaller players, in our view.""

The decrease in revenues reflected the impact from the ongoing weak demand for regular breeder hogs, lower prices for regular hogs and black hogs, and fewer black hogs available for sale after the July 2016 flood damage. Revenues from hog farming, which includes sales of regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs, and black hogs, decreased by $2.67 million, or 30.9%, to $5.97 million for the first quarter of 2017 from $8.64 million for the same period of last year. The Company sold a total of 30,217 regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs and black hogs with a blended average selling price of $198 per hog during the first quarter of 2017, compared to 35,112 hogs sold and a blended average selling price of $246 per hog for the same period of last year.

Revenues for the first quarter of 2017 from black market hogs decreased by 40.1% to $2.43 million with the number of black hogs sold decreasing by 28.7% to 10,588 hogs and the average selling price of black hogs decreasing by 16.1% to $230 per hog. We sold 136,682 kilograms of specialty black hog pork products through retail at approximately $5 per kilogram, generating revenues of $0.71 million for the first quarter of 2017. This compares to 87,384 kilograms sold at approximately $5 per kilogram and revenues of $0.42 million for the same period of last year. The increase in our specialty black hog pork products was mainly related to a new online e-commerce customer. These revenues, combined with the sales of black market hogs, led to $3.14 million in revenues from our black hog program for the first quarter of 2017, compared to $4.48 million for the same period of last year.
