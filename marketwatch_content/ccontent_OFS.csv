OFS,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward-Looking Statements our dependence on key personnel; our ability to maintain or develop referral relationships; our ability to replicate historical results;  the ability of OFS Advisor to identify, invest in and monitor companies that meet our investment criteria; actual and potential conflicts of interest with OFS Advisor and other affiliates of OFSAM;  constraint on investment due to access to material nonpublic information; restrictions on our ability to enter into transactions with our affiliates; limitations on the amount of SBA-guaranteed debentures that may be issued by an SBIC; Our ability to comply with SBA regulations and requirements; the use of borrowed money to finance a portion of our investments; competition for investment opportunities; the ability of SBIC I LP to make distributions enabling us to meet RIC requirements; our ability to raise debt or equity capital as a BDC; the timing, form and amount of any distributions from our portfolio companies; the impact of a protracted decline in the liquidity of credit markets on our business; the general economy and its impact on the industries in which we invest; uncertain valuations of our portfolio investments; and the effect of new or modified laws or regulations governing our operations. Although we believe that the assumptions on which these forward-looking statements are based are reasonable, any of those assumptions could prove to be inaccurate, and as a result, the forward-looking statements based on those assumptions also could be inaccurate. In light of these and other uncertainties, the inclusion of a projection or forward-looking statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should not be regarded as a representation by us that our plans and objectives will be achieved. These risks and uncertainties include, among others, those described or identified in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which apply only as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Critical Accounting Policies and Significant Estimates The preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those that require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods. Changes that may be required in the underlying assumptions or estimates in these areas could have a material impact on our current and future financial condition and results of operations. Our critical accounting policies and estimates are those relating to revenue recognition and fair value estimates. Management has discussed the development and selection of each critical accounting policy and estimate with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. For a descriptions of our revenue recognition and fair value policies, see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements included in ""Item 8.-Financial Statements"" of this report. Revenue recognition  of such significance to deem it the consummation of the initial investment transaction and the acquisition of new Instruments (i.e., a ""significant modification""), or a modification of those Instruments to be recognized over their remaining lives, and  an additional allocation of consideration among newly acquired Instruments. These allocations are generally based on the relative fair value of the Instruments at the time of the transaction, a process involving fair value estimates which is also a critical accounting policy and significant estimate. Moreover, these allocations and determinations can differ between GAAP and federal income tax bases. Once determined, these allocations directly affect the discount/premium and yield on debt securities, the cost and net gains/losses on equity securities, and capital structuring fees recognized in the statements of operations; and ICTI. These allocations require an understanding of the terms and conditions of the underlying agreements and requires significant management judgment. The table below presents the impact to the initial cost bases of allocated consideration to acquired Instruments for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015, (in thousands):  2017 2016 2015 Loans: Net Loan Fees (1) (excluding equity securities and cash amendment fees) $ (1,376 ) $ (983 ) $ (922 ) Equity securities (including performance-contingent fees) - (822 ) - Equity securities (including performance-contingent fees) - 822 - Capital structuring fees 531 369 653  (1) Loan origination fees, OID, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees. On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC Topic 606, which will result in the re-characterization of capital structuring fees received from portfolio companies, which are recognized as earned upon the closing of an investment, to a component of Net Loan Fees, which are recorded as an adjustment to the amortized cost of the investment and amortized as an adjustment to interest income over the life of the respective debt investment. The adoption of new revenue guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, including the presentation of revenues in our consolidated statements of operations.

The effect of hypothetical changes in actual, observed interest rates on our fair value measures is not subject to reasonable estimation. Related Party Transactions We have entered into a number of business relationships with affiliated or related parties, including the following: The Investment Advisory Agreement with OFS Advisor to manage our operating and investment activities. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement we have agreed to pay OFS Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts and including assets owned by any consolidated entity) as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. See ""Item 1-Management and Other Agreements"" and ""Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4"". The Administration Agreement with OFS Capital Services, an affiliate of OFS Advisor, to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our operations. See ""Item 1-Management and Other Agreements"" and ""Item 8-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data-Note 4"". A license agreement with OFSAM, the parent company of OFS Advisor, under which OFSAM has agreed to grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to use the name ""OFS."" Under this agreement, we have a right to use the ""OFS"" name for so long as OFS Advisor or one of its affiliates remains our investment adviser. Other than with respect to this limited license, we have no legal right to the ""OFS"" name. This license agreement will remain in effect for so long as the Investment Advisory Agreement with OFS Advisor is in effect.  OFS Advisor's services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive to us and OFS Advisor is free to furnish similar services to other entities, including other BDCs affiliated with OFS Advisor, so long as its services to us are not impaired. OFS Advisor also serves as the investment adviser to CLO funds and other assets, including HPCI, a non-traded BDC with an investment strategy similar to ours.

Weighted average yield on total investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest on our debt investments at the balance sheet date, plus the annualized accretion of Net Loan Fees, plus the effective yield on our performing preferred equity investments, divided by (b) amortized cost of our total investment portfolio, including assets in non-accrual status as of the balance sheet date. The weighted average yield of our investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, the gross investment income from our investment portfolio before the payment of all of our fees and expenses. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. The weighted average yield on our performing debt increased from 12.08% at December 31, 2016 to 12.11% at December 31, 2017, primarily due to an increase in the applicable LIBOR rates which are indexed to our variable rate debt investments, offset by approximately $64.8 million in sales and repayments of debt investments with a weighted average yield of 10.91%, and the deployment of cash during the nine months ended December 31, 2017, including partial deployment of proceeds received from our April 2017 follow-on public offering (the ""Offering""), into $107.4 million of debt investments with a weighted average yield of 10.85% at December 31, 2017.

OFS,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. We were formed on December 8, 2015, as a corporation under the laws of Maryland. Our investment objective is to provide our stockholders with both current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments. Our investment strategy focuses primarily on investments in middle-market companies in the United States. We use the term ""middle-market"" to refer to companies that may exhibit one or more of the following characteristics: number of employees between 150 and 2,000; revenues between $15 million and $300 million; annual EBITDA, between $3 million and $50 million; generally, private companies owned by private equity firms or owners/operators; and enterprise value between $10 million and $500 million. For additional information about how we define the middle-market, see ""Item 1. Business-Investment Criteria/Guidelines"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. While our investment strategy focuses primarily on middle-market companies in the United States, including senior secured loans, which includes first-lien, second-lien and unitranche loans as well as subordinated loans and, to a lesser extent, warrants and other equity securities, we also may invest up to 30% of our portfolio in opportunistic investments of non-eligible portfolio companies. Specifically, as part of this 30% basket, we may consider investments in investment funds that are operating pursuant to certain exceptions to the 1940 Act and in advisers to similar investment funds, as well as in debt of middle-market companies located outside of the United States and debt and equity of public companies that do not meet the definition of eligible portfolio companies because their market capitalization of publicly traded equity securities exceeds the levels provided for in the 1940 Act. We intend to raise up to $200,000,000 through the Offering, in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Placement activities are conducted by our officers and OFS Advisor. In addition, we have entered, and may enter, into additional agreements with placement agents or broker-dealers to solicit investor capital commitments (""Capital Commitments""). In particular, we and OFS Advisor have entered into a dealer manager agreement with International Assets Advisory, LLC and certain participating broker-dealers to solicit Capital Commitments. Fees and expenses paid pursuant to these agreements will be paid in part by us and in part by OFS Advisor. On August 30, 2016, Funding I, a subsidiary of OFSAM, purchased 74,074 shares of our common stock in the Offering for gross proceeds of $1,000,000 (""Minimum Offering Requirement""), or $13.50 per share. No selling commissions or dealer manager fees were paid by us in connection with this purchase. On May 19, 2017, OFS Advisor agreed to pay the dealer manager fee on subsequent sales of shares of our common stock in the Offering. Payments of dealer manager fees by OFS Advisor are not subject to reimbursement by us. Since commencing operations on August 30, 2016, we have sold a total of 659,893 shares of common stock for total gross proceeds of $9,079,800 Our investment activities are managed by OFS Advisor and supervised by our Board, a majority of whom are independent of us, OFS Advisor and its affiliates. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement we have agreed to pay OFS Advisor an annual base management fee, and an incentive fee based on our investment performance. From August 30, 2016, the effective date of the Investment Advisory Agreement, through May 19, 2017, the base management fee was calculated at an annual rate of 2.0% and based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts and including assets owned by any consolidated entity) at the end of the two most recently completed calendar quarters, adjusted for any share issuances or repurchases during the quarter. On May 19, 2017, OFS Advisor agreed to permanently reduce the base management fee from 2.0% per annum to 1.25% per annum. Our sub-adviser will continue to receive the amount of management fees allocated to it pursuant to the Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement, subject to the reduced base management fee. OFS Advisor also serves as the investment adviser to CLO funds and other assets, including OFS Capital, a publicly traded BDC with an investment strategy similar to the Company's. Evolv, a registered investment adviser, serves as our sub-adviser pursuant to the Investment Sub-Advisory Agreement. We have also entered into an Administration Agreement with OFS Services. Under our Administration Agreement, we have agreed to reimburse OFS Services for our allocable portion (subject to the review and approval of our independent directors) of overhead and other expenses incurred by OFS Services in performing its obligations under the Administration Agreement. As a BDC, we must not acquire any assets other than ""qualifying assets"" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our assets, as defined by the 1940 Act, are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions). Qualifying assets include investments in ""eligible portfolio companies."" Under the relevant SEC rules, the term ""eligible portfolio company"" includes all private companies, companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized in the United States.  The Investment Advisory Agreement with OFS Advisor to manage our operating and investment activities. Under the Investment Advisory Agreement we have agreed to pay OFS Advisor an annual base management fee based on the average value of our total assets (other than cash and cash equivalents but including assets purchased with borrowed amounts and including assets owned by any consolidated entity) as well as an incentive fee based on our investment performance. See ""Item 1-Financial Statements-Note 3"". The Administration Agreement with OFS Capital Services, an affiliate of OFS Advisor, to provide us with the office facilities and administrative services necessary to conduct our operations. See ""Item 1-Financial Statements-Note 3"". Expense Limitation Agreements: OFS Advisor limits the Company's incurred expenses under two agreements: the Investment Advisory Agreement, which contains provisions limiting organization and offering costs, and Contractual Issuer Expenses; and an Expense Support Agreement, which limits all other operating expenses. Both agreement contain conditions under which we may become obligated to reimburse OFS advisor for expense limitations provided thereunder. See ""Item 1-Financial Statements-Note 3"".  OFS Advisor's services under the Investment Advisory Agreement are not exclusive to us and OFS Advisor is free to furnish similar services to other entities, including other BDCs affiliated with OFS Advisor, so long as its services to us are not impaired. OFS Advisor also serves as the investment adviser to CLO funds and other assets, including OFS Capital, a publicly traded BDC with an investment strategy similar to the Company.

We benefit from two expense limitation agreements with OFS Advisor: portions of the Investment Advisory Agreement, which limit our liability to reimburse OFS Advisor for organization and offering expenses it incurs on our behalf, and the Expense Support Agreement. See ""Item 1 - Financial Statements - Note 3."" Fair value estimates. As discussed more fully in ""Item 1.-Financial Statements-Note 5"" GAAP requires us to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted, active market prices for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place (Level 3). All of our assets carried at fair value are classified as Level 3; we typically do not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange.

The following table shows the portfolio composition by U.S. geographic region at amortized cost and fair value and as a percentage of total investments; the geographic composition is determined by the location of the portfolio company's corporate headquarters:  Amortized Cost Fair Value September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 South - US $ 984,804 36.1 % $ - - % $ 986,203 36.2 % $ - - % Northeast - U.S. 1,025,298 37.5 98,500 100.0 1,022,886 37.5 98,652 100.0 West - U.S. 149,332 5.5 - - 146,250 5.4 - - Midwest - US 569,525 20.9 - - 570,050 20.9 - - Total $ 2,728,959 100.0 % $ 98,500 100.0 % $ 2,725,389 100.0 % $ 98,652 100.0 %  At September 30, 2017, the weighted average yield on our debt investment portfolio was 9.91%. The weighted average yield on our debt investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest on our debt investments at the balance sheet date, plus the annualized accretion of Net Loan Fees divided by (b) amortized cost of our debt investments as of the balance sheet date. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses.

OFS,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Our investment activities are managed by OFS Advisor; and OFS Services, an affiliate of OFS Advisor, provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. In exchange for these services we pay OFS Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee and we pay OFS Services an administration fee. The base management fee, incentive fee, and the administration fee represents a substantial portion of our total expenses. Our investment objective is to provide our stockholders with both current income and capital appreciation primarily through debt investments and, to a lesser extent, equity investments in middle-market companies in the United States. We believe that these middle-market companies represent a significant growth segment of the U.S. economy and often require substantial capital investments to grow. Middle-market companies have historically constituted the bulk of our portfolio companies since inception, and as of September 30, 2017. We believe that this market segment will continue to produce significant investment opportunities for us. In April 2017, we issued 3,625,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on public offering at an offering price of $14.57 per share (the ""Offering""), including shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to their exercise of the over-allotment option. OFS Advisor paid all of the underwriting discounts and commissions and an additional supplemental payment of $0.25 per share, representing the difference between the public offering price of $14.57 per share and the net offering proceeds of $14.82 per share, which also represented our NAV per share at the time of the Offering. All payments made by OFS Advisor in connection with the Offering are not subject to reimbursement by us. We received net proceeds from this Offering of $53.7 million Our investment strategy includes SBIC I LP, a licensee under the SBA's SBIC program. The SBIC license allows SBIC I LP to receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA leverage funding is subject to SBIC I LP's payment of certain fees to the SBA, and the ability of SBIC I LP to draw on the leverage commitment is subject to its compliance with SBA regulations and policies, including an audit by the SBA. On a stand-alone basis, SBIC I LP held approximately $248.2 million and $247.5 million in assets at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which accounted for approximately 70% and 81% of our total consolidated assets, respectively. We generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to eight years and bear interest at fixed and floating rates. As of September 30, 2017, floating rate and fixed rate loans comprised 73% and 27%, respectively, of our current debt investment portfolio at fair value; however, in accordance with our investment strategy, we expect that over time the proportion of fixed rate loans will continue to increase. We expect to make quarterly distributions, such that we distribute substantially all of our ICTI. In addition, although we intend to make distributions of net realized capital gains, if any, at least annually, out of assets legally available for such distributions, we may in the future decide to retain such capital gains for investment. Further, we have elected to be taxed as a RIC under the Code. As a RIC, we are not required to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our ICTI. We are required to recognize ICTI in circumstances in which we have not received a corresponding payment in cash. For example, we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as issued with OID and debt instruments with PIK interest, and we must include in ICTI each year the portion of the OID and PIK interest that accrues for that year (as it accrues over the life of the obligation), irrespective of the fact the cash representing such income is received by us in that taxable year. The continued recognition of non-cash ICTI may cause difficulty in meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement. We may be required to sell investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital, or forgo new investment opportunities to meet this requirement. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax. We are permitted to borrow money from time to time within the levels permitted by the 1940 Act (which generally allows us to incur leverage for up to 50% of our asset base). We may borrow money when the terms and conditions available are favorable to do so and are aligned with our investment strategy and portfolio composition. The use of borrowed funds or the proceeds of preferred stock to make investments would have its own specific benefits and risks, and all of the costs of borrowing funds or issuing preferred stock would be borne by holders of our common stock. For a discussion of the risks associated with leverage, see ""Item 1A. Risk Factors-Risks Related to our Business and Structure"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016. As a BDC, we may need to raise additional capital, which will expose us to risks, including the typical risks associated with leverage. For additional overview information on the Company, see ""Item 1. Business"" in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016.  of such significance to deem it the consummation of the initial investment transaction and the acquisition of new Instruments (i.e., a ""significant modification""), or a modification of those Instruments to be recognized over their remaining lives, and  an additional allocation of consideration among newly acquired Instruments. These allocations are generally based on the relative fair value of the Instruments at the time of the transaction, a process involving fair value estimates which is also a critical accounting policy and significant estimate. Moreover, these allocations and determinations can differ between GAAP and federal income tax bases. Once determined, these allocations directly effect the discount/premium and yield on debt securities, the cost and net gains/losses on equity securities, and capital structuring fees recognized in the statements of operations; and ICTI. These allocations require an understanding of the terms and conditions of the underlying agreements and significant management judgment. The table below presents the impact to the initial cost bases of allocated consideration to acquired Instruments for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, and 2016, (in thousands):  Nine Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 Loans: Net Loan Fees (excluding equity securities and cash amendment fees) $ (968 ) $ (646 ) Equity securities (including performance-contingent fees) - (793 ) Equity securities (including performance-contingent fees) - 793 Capital structuring fees (651 ) (153 )  Fair value estimates. As of September 30, 2017, approximately 83% of our total assets were carried on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. As discussed more fully in ""Item 1.-Financial Statements-Note 2"" GAAP requires us to categorize financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value according to a three-level valuation hierarchy. The hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted, active market prices for identical assets and liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to valuation techniques that require significant management judgment because one or more of the significant inputs are unobservable in the market place (Level 3). All of our assets carried at fair value are classified as Level 3; we typically do not hold equity securities or other instruments that are actively traded on an exchange. The following table illustrates the sensitivity of our fair value measures to reasonably likely changes to the estimated discount rate and EBITDA multiple inputs used in our debt and equity investment valuations at September 30, 2017 (dollar amounts in thousands):  Weighted Discount rate sensitivity EBITDA multiple sensitivity average discount rate/EBITDA Fair Value at multiple at -10% +10% Valuation Method / September 30, September 30, Weighted Weighted Investment Type 2017 2017 average average +0.5x -0.5x Discounted cash flow Debt investments: Senior Secured $ 126,310 11.52% $ 128,711 $ 123,162 N/A N/A Subordinated $ 48,897 15.05% $ 49,843 $ 47,395 N/A N/A Enterprise value Debt investments: Senior Secured $ 11,841 7.50x N/A N/A $ 12,626 $ 11,055 Subordinated $ 5,322 7.47x N/A N/A $ 6,239 $ 4,405 Equity investments: Preferred equity $ 22,855 7.16x N/A N/A $ 25,316 $ 19,441 Common equity and warrants $ 10,324 5.65x N/A N/A $ 10,441 $ 8,042  The table above presents the impact to our debt and equity investment fair value accounting measures by uniformly modifying our discount rate and EBITDA valuation inputs, as applicable. This discount rate sensitivity measures included in the table do not present the estimated effect of hypothetical changes in actual, observed interest rates, which would affect the cash flows from many of the underlying investments as they are indexed to LIBOR or the Prime Rate of interest, the operating environment of many of our portfolio companies, and other factors, as well as our estimates of the discount rate valuation input. The effect of hypothetical changes in actual, observed interest rates on our fair value measures is not subject to reasonable estimation.

Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q. Overview We are an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company and have elected to be treated as a BDC under the 1940 Act. Our investment activities are managed by OFS Advisor; and OFS Services, an affiliate of OFS Advisor, provides the administrative services necessary for us to operate. In exchange for these services we pay OFS Advisor a base management fee and an incentive fee and we pay OFS Services an administration fee. The base management fee, incentive fee, and the administration fee represents a substantial portion of our total expenses.

All payments made by OFS Advisor in connection with the Offering are not subject to reimbursement by us. We received net proceeds from this Offering of $53.7 million Our investment strategy includes SBIC I LP, a licensee under the SBA's SBIC program. The SBIC license allows SBIC I LP to receive SBA-guaranteed debenture funding, subject to the issuance of a leverage commitment by the SBA and other customary procedures. SBA leverage funding is subject to SBIC I LP's payment of certain fees to the SBA, and the ability of SBIC I LP to draw on the leverage commitment is subject to its compliance with SBA regulations and policies, including an audit by the SBA. On a stand-alone basis, SBIC I LP held approximately $247.3 million and $247.5 million in assets at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, respectively, which accounted for approximately 71% and 81% of our total consolidated assets, respectively. We generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments, capital gains, and dividend income from our equity investments. Our debt investments typically have a term of three to eight years and bear interest at fixed and floating rates. As of June 30, 2017, floating rate and fixed rate loans comprised 76% and 24%, respectively, of our current debt investment portfolio at fair value; however, in accordance with our investment strategy, we expect that over time the proportion of fixed rate loans will continue to increase.

As a RIC, we are not required to pay corporate-level federal income taxes on any income that we distribute to our stockholders from our ICTI. We are required to recognize ICTI in circumstances in which we have not received a corresponding payment in cash. For example, we hold debt obligations that are treated under applicable tax rules as issued with OID and debt instruments with PIK interest, and we must include in ICTI each year the portion of the OID and PIK interest that accrues for that year (as it accrues over the life of the obligation), irrespective of the fact the cash representing such income is received by us in that taxable year. The continued recognition of non-cash ICTI may cause difficulty in meeting the Annual Distribution Requirement. We may be required to sell investments at times and/or at prices we would not consider advantageous, raise additional debt or equity capital, or forgo new investment opportunities to meet this requirement. If we are not able to obtain cash from other sources, we may fail to qualify for RIC tax treatment and thus become subject to corporate-level income tax.

OFS,"CHICAGO, Mar 02, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OFS Capital Corporation OFS, -0.98% (“OFS Capital”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2017. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Fourth quarter net investment income of $3.8 million, or $0.29 per share. Closed investments totaled $28.3 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. As of March 2, 2018, closed approximately $44.4 million of additional new investments during the first quarter of 2018. 79% and 76% of the fair value of our loan portfolio was senior and floating rate, respectively, and the weighted average yield of our performing loan portfolio was 12.11% as of December 31, 2017 [(1)] . 89% of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average cost of 3.43% as of December 31, 2017, with maturities in 2022 and beyond. On February 27, 2018, OFS Capital's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.34 per share for the first quarter of 2018. The distribution, along with a previously announced $0.37 per share special distribution, are payable on March 29, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 22, 2018. ""We are focused on increasing our net investment income by executing on our strong pipeline while maintaining the quality of our portfolio,"" said Bilal Rashid, OFS Capital's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""So far in the first quarter, we have deployed $44.4 million of the $73.0 million of cash we had on hand at year-end. We believe that we are well positioned to grow our earnings. Our commitment to capital preservation, and strong long-term performance is enhanced by the alignment of interests of our stockholders and our external manager, which continues to own approximately 22% of the outstanding OFS Capital common stock.""   (1)   See Highlights contained in this press release for further information on our weighted average yield. Including assets on non-accrual, the weighted average yield of our debt investment portfolio was 11.59% at December 31, 2017.   HIGHLIGHTS ($ in millions, except for per share data)   Portfolio Overview     At December 31, 2017 Total assets $ 357.8 Investment portfolio, at fair value $ 277.5 Net assets $ 188.3 Net asset value per share $ 14.12 Weighted average yield on performing debt investments [(1)] 12.11 % Weighted average yield on total debt investments [(2)] 11.59 % Weighted average yield on total investments [(3)] 10.35 % (1)   The weighted average yield on our performing debt investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest on our debt investments at the balance sheet date, plus the annualized accretion of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees divided by (b) amortized cost of our debt investments, excluding assets on non-accrual basis as of the balance sheet date.   (2) The weighted average yield on total debt investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest on our debt investments at the balance sheet date, plus the annualized accretion of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees divided by (b) amortized cost of our debt investments, including assets on non-accrual basis as of the balance sheet date.   (3) The weighted average yield on total investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest on our debt investments at the balance sheet date, plus the annualized accretion of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees, plus the effective cash yield on our performing preferred equity investments divided by (b) amortized cost of our total investment portfolio, including assets on non-accrual basis as of the balance sheet date. The weighted average yield of investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses.       Quarter Ended December 31,   Year Ended December 31, Operating Results 2017   2016   2017   2016 Total investment income $ 8.3 $ 8.2 $ 33.4 $ 31.1 Net investment income $ 3.8 $ 3.7 $ 15.9 $ 14.1 Net investment income per common share, basic and diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.39 $ 1.28 $ 1.46 Adjusted net investment income (a Non-GAAP measure described below) $ 3.8 $ 3.7 $ 15.9 $ 14.0 Adjusted net investment income (a Non-GAAP measure described below) per share, basic and diluted $ 0.29 $ 0.39 $ 1.28 $ 1.44 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations $ 4.2 $ 4.8 $ 7.9 $ 13.8       Quarter Ended December 31,     Year Ended December 31, Portfolio Activity 2017     2016     2017     2016 Number of new portfolio companies 4 3     17     8 Investments in new portfolio companies $ 19.3 $ 26.1 $ 118.9 $ 49.4 Investments in existing portfolio companies $ 9.0 $ 2.0 $ 24.0 $ 18.8 Number of portfolio companies at end of period 37 41 37 41   PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES During the fourth quarter of 2017, we closed four senior secured debt investments in four new portfolio companies totaling $18.8 million, one of which also included a new common equity investment of $0.5 million. In addition, we made $9.0 million of senior secured debt investments in existing portfolio companies, including $2.6 million in delayed draw and revolver fundings. The total fair value of our investment portfolio was $277.5 million at December 31, 2017, which was equal to approximately 96% of amortized cost. As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of OFS Capital's debt investment portfolio totaled $246.3 million in 35 portfolio companies, of which 79% and 21% were senior secured loans and subordinated loans, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we also held approximately $31.2 million in equity investments, at fair value, in 17 portfolio companies in which we also held debt investments and two portfolio companies in which we solely held an equity investment. We had unfunded commitments of $9.9 million to three portfolio companies at December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, floating rate loans comprised 76% of OFS Capital’s debt investment portfolio, with the remaining 24% in fixed rate loans, as a percentage of fair value. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Income Interest Income Interest income increased approximately $2.0 million primarily due to a $3.4 million increase in recurring interest income caused by a 12% increase in the average outstanding loan balance during 2017, offset by a decrease of $1.4 million in recurring interest income resulting from a 63 basis point decrease in the weighted average yield in our portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2017. Acceleration of Net Loan Fees (defined as loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees) of $0.6 million and $0.6 million were included in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, from the repayment of loans prior to their scheduled due dates. Fee Income Fee income increased $0.3 million primarily due to an increase in prepayment fees and capital structuring fees. We recorded prepayment fees of $1.0 million resulting from $60.2 million of unscheduled principal payments during the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $0.9 million from $25.0 million of unscheduled principal payments during 2016. We recognized capital structuring fees of $0.5 million and $0.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, upon the closing of $55.7 million and $37.3 million of debt and equity investments, respectively. Expenses Interest expense Interest expense increased primarily due to an increase in borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility (""PWB Credit Facility""). The average dollar amount of borrowings outstanding under the PWB Credit Facility during the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $8.5 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Management Fees Management fee expense increased by $0.5 million, due to an increase in our average total assets, primarily due to an increase in net investment activity, including deployment of funds from our follow-on public offering of 3,625,000 shares of our common stock in April 2017 (the ""Offering""). Incentive Fees Incentive fee expense decreased by $0.4 million primarily due to a $0.6 million decrease in Part One incentive fees (based on net investment income), due to a share issuance adjustment related to the Offering, which raised the hurdle rate to a level that was not exceeded in the second quarter because the Offering proceeds were not fully deployed, offset by an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income due to an increase in net investment activity, including additional deployment of funds from the Offering, and an increase in the accrued Capital Gains Fee (based on cumulative net unrealized and realized capital gains). During the year ended December 31, 2017, we did not incur a Capital Gains Fee, compared to a Capital Gains Fee of $(0.1) million recorded during the year ended December 31, 2016, which represents the reversal of the accrued Capital Gains Fee at December 31, 2015. Net Gain (Loss) on Investments We recognized net losses of $4.4 million on senior secured debt during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of a realized loss of $5.0 million on our senior secured debt investment in My Alarm, LLC (""My Alarm"") recognized upon restructuring in the third quarter of 2017, offset by the positive net impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors on other investments. We held the My Alarm investment from the fourth quarter of 2015 and recognized unrealized appreciation of $0.2 million and $0 during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. We recognized net losses of $8.7 million on subordinated debt during the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the net negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors, including unrealized depreciation of $5.4 million recognized on our debt investment in Community Intervention Services, Inc., which was placed on non-accrual status during 2016, unrealized depreciation of $2.1 million recognized on our debt investment in Southern Technical Institute, LLC, which was placed on non-accrual status during the fourth quarter of 2017, and $1.6 million of unrealized depreciation on our debt investment in Master Cutlery, LLC. We recognized net gains of $5.4 million on preferred equity investments for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of $7.7 million of net realized gains recognized upon sale of three equity investments (Strategic Pharma Solutions, Inc., smarTours, LLC, and Malabar International), offset by the negative impact from changes to EBITDA multiples used in our valuations and negative impacts of portfolio company-specific performance factors, including a $2.1 million unrealized loss recognized on our equity investment in Southern Technical Institute, LLC. Included in net gains of $7.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, were realized gains of $11.0 million we recognized upon sale of the three aforementioned equity investments. We recognized cumulative unrealized appreciation of approximately $3.3 million on these investments through December 31, 2016, which resulted in an aggregate net gain of $7.7 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. In addition, previously recognized cumulative unrealized depreciation of $0.3 million at June 30, 2017, on our preferred equity investments in My Alarm, was realized upon restructuring. We recognized net losses of $0.2 million on common equity and warrant investments for the year ended December 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors, offset by a $0.4 million net gain realized upon sale of a common equity investment (Intelli-Mark Technologies, Inc.), which includes a realized gain of $0.9 million, for which we had recognized cumulative unrealized appreciation of $0.5 million through December 31, 2016. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At December 31, 2017, we had $73.0 million in cash and cash equivalents, which includes cash and cash equivalents of $72.1 million held by our wholly owned small business investment company, and $149.9 million in outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures. As of December 31, 2017, we had $17.4 million available for additional borrowings on our PWB Credit Facility and had drawn all of our available SBA-guaranteed debentures.

Adjusted NII represents net investment income excluding the net capital gains incentive fee (fee adjustments) in periods in which they occur. Our management agreement with OFS Capital Management, LLC provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses for such year. Management believes that Adjusted NII is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any net capital gains incentive fee, as net investment income does not include gains associated with the capital gains incentive fee. In addition, management believes that providing Adjusted NII may facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into OFS Capital’s ongoing operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period, and afford investors a view of results that may be more easily compared to those of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation from net investment income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted NII for the periods presented:     Quarter Ended December 31,     Year Ended December 31, 2017     2016 2017     2016 (Dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data)   Net investment income $ 3,819 $ 3,736 $ 15,877 $ 14,145   Capital gains incentive fee — — — (139 )   Adjusted net investment income $ 3,819   $ 3,736   $ 15,877   $ 14,006     Adjusted net investment income per common share: Basic and diluted $ 0.29   $ 0.39   $ 1.28   $ 1.44     Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic and diluted 13,334,909   9,697,277   12,403,706   9,700,297     ABOUT OFS CAPITAL OFS Capital Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company.

OFS,"CHICAGO, Nov 03, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OFS Capital Corporation OFS, -0.98% (“OFS Capital”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) today announced its financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Net investment income of $4.4 million, or $0.33 per share. Closed investments totaled $42.4 million in the third quarter of 2017; as of September 30, 2017, 76% of our loan portfolio was senior secured. 73% of the fair value of our loan portfolio was floating rate, and the weighted average yield of our performing loan portfolio was 11.50% as of September 30, 2017 [(1)] . At September 30, 2017, we had one loan investment on non-accrual. 90% of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average cost of 3.43% as of September 30, 2017, with maturities in 2022 and beyond. On October 31, 2017, OFS Capital's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.34 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, payable on December 29, 2017 to stockholders of record as of December 15, 2017. ""We remain focused on generating strong distributions for our shareholders,"" said Bilal Rashid, OFS Capital's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""We closed $108.6 million in investments over the last two quarters. We believe that we are well positioned to grow earnings as we prudently deploy the $53.9 million of cash on hand at the end of the third quarter. Our commitment to capital preservation, and strong long-term performance is enhanced by the alignment of interests of our stockholders and our external manager, which continues to own approximately 2.9 million shares, or 22% of the outstanding OFS Capital common stock.""         (1)     See Highlights contained in this press release for further information on our weighted average yield. Including assets on non- accrual, the weighted average yield of our debt investment portfolio was 11.17% at September 30, 2017.   HIGHLIGHTS ($ in millions, except for per share data)       Portfolio Overview At September 30, 2017 Total assets $ 356.5 Investment portfolio, at fair value $ 296.6 Net assets $ 188.7 Net asset value per share $ 14.15 Weighted average yield [(1)] 11.50 % Weighted average yield, including loans on non-accrual [(1)] 11.17 %       (1) The weighted average yield on our debt investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest plus the annualized accretion of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees, divided by (b) amortized cost of debt investments, excluding assets on non-accrual basis as of the balance sheet date. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses.         Quarter ended September 30, Operating Results 2017   2016 Total investment income $ 9.1 $ 7.4 Net investment income $ 4.4 $ 3.3 Net investment income per common share, basic and diluted $ 0.33 $ 0.34 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations per common share, basic and diluted $ 0.09 $ 0.25         Quarter ended September 30, Portfolio Activity 2017   2016 Number of new portfolio companies 3 2 Investments in new portfolio companies $ 40.5 $ 14.3 Investments in existing portfolio companies $ 1.9 $ 2.1 Number of portfolio companies at end of period 40 38   PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES During the third quarter of 2017, OFS Capital closed $40.5 million of investments in three new portfolio companies, including a $21.3 million senior secured debt investment together with a $2.9 million preferred equity investment, an $8.7 million subordinated debt investment together with a $0.7 million common equity investment, and a $6.9 million senior secured debt investment. In addition, OFS Capital closed $1.0 million of new senior secured debt investments in two existing portfolio companies, which included a delayed draw funding of $0.5 million, and a $1.0 million preferred equity investment in an existing portfolio company. The total fair value of OFS Capital’s investment portfolio was $296.6 million at September 30, 2017, which was equal to approximately 98% of amortized cost. As of September 30, 2017, the fair value of OFS Capital's debt investment portfolio totaled $257.1 million in 37 portfolio companies, of which 76% and 24% were senior secured loans and subordinated loans, respectively. As of September 30, 2017, we also held approximately $39.5 million in equity investments, at fair value, in 17 portfolio companies in which we also held debt investments and three portfolio companies in which we solely held an equity investment. We had unfunded commitments of $4.5 million to three portfolio companies at September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, floating rate loans comprised 73% of OFS Capital’s debt investment portfolio, with the remaining 27% in fixed rate loans, as a percentage of fair value. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Income Interest Income: Interest income increased by $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016. The $1.2 million increase was due to a $1.1 million increase primarily attributable to a 19% increase in the average outstanding loan balance, and a $0.2 million increase in Net Loan Fee amortization, offset by a $0.1 million decrease primarily attributable to a 30 basis points decrease in the weighted average yield in our portfolio. Acceleration of Net Loan Fees of $0.3 million and $0.1 million were included in interest income for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Fee Income: Fee income increased by $0.6 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016, primarily due to an increase in prepayment fees and structuring fees of $0.3 million and $0.4 million, respectively, offset by a $0.1 million decrease in other fees. We recorded prepayment fees of $0.3 million resulting from $17.5 million of unscheduled principal payments during the three months ended September 30, 2017. We did not receive any unscheduled principal payments subject to prepayment fees during the three months ended September 30, 2016. We recorded structuring fees of $0.5 million in connection with the closing of $30.2 million of investments during the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to structuring fees of $0.1 million in connection with the closing of $9.5 million of investments during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Expenses Interest expense for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, increased over the corresponding periods in the prior year due to an increase in borrowings under our senior secured revolving credit facility (""PWB Credit Facility""). The average dollar amount of borrowings under the PWB Credit Facility outstanding during the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $11.1 million and $5.8 million, respectively. There were no borrowings under the PWB Credit Facility during the three or nine months ended September 30, 2016. Management fee expense for the three months ended September 30, 2017, increased over the corresponding period in the prior year due to an increase in our average total assets, primarily due to a increase in net investment activity, including deployment of funds from our follow-on public offering of 3,625,000 shares of our common stock in April 2017 (the ""Offering""). Incentive fee expense increased by $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017, compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 due to an increase in pre-incentive fee net investment income compared to the prior year, which was primarily attributable to an increase in the average investment balance as a result of net investment activity, including deployment of funds from the Offering. Net gain (loss) on investments Net gain (loss) on investments consists of the sum of: (a) realized gains and losses from the sale of debt or equity securities, or the redemption of equity securities; and (b) changes in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation on debt and equity investments. In the period in which a realized gain or loss is recognized, such gain or loss will generally be offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized appreciation or depreciation, and the net gain recognized in that period will generally be smaller. The unrealized appreciation or depreciation on debt securities is also reversed when those investments are redeemed or paid off prior to maturity. In such instances, the reversal of unrealized appreciation or depreciation will be reported as a net loss or gain, respectively, and may be partially offset by the acceleration of any premium or discount on the debt security in interest income and any prepayment fees on the debt security in fee income. We recognized net losses of $1.7 million on senior secured debt during the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors. In addition, a previously recognized cumulative unrealized loss of $5.0 million at June 30, 2017, on My Alarm Center, LLC was realized during the three months ended September 30, 2017 upon restructure of the senior secured debt investment into preferred and common equity interests. We recognized net losses of $2.3 million on subordinated debt during the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors, including an unrealized loss of $1.2 million recognized on our subordinated debt investment in Community Intervention Services, Inc., which was placed on non-accrual during 2016. We recognized net gains of $0.3 million on preferred equity investments for the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the positive impact from changes to EBITDA multiples used in our valuations as a result of pending transactions, offset by the net negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors. Included in net gains of $0.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was a realized gain of $3.6 million we recognized upon exit of a preferred equity investment. We recognized cumulative unrealized gains of approximately $3.6 million on this investment through June 30, 2017, which resulted in a net gain of $-0- during the three months ended September 30, 2017. In addition, previously recognized cumulative unrealized losses of $0.3 million at June 30, 2017, on our preferred equity investments in My Alarm Center, LLC, was realized upon restructuring. We recognized net gains of $0.5 million on common equity and warrant investments for the three months ended September 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the positive impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At September 30, 2017, we had $53.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and $149.9 million in outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures. As of September 30, 2017, we had $17.9 million available for additional borrowings on our senior secured revolving credit facility with Pacific Western Bank and had drawn all of our available SBA-guaranteed debentures.

OFS,"CHICAGO, Aug 04, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OFS Capital Corporation OFS, -0.98% (“OFS Capital”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Net investment income of $4.3 million, or $0.33 per share. Adjusted net investment income of $4.0 million, or $0.31 per share [(1)] . Closed investments totaled $66.1 million in the second quarter of 2017. As of August 4, 2017, we closed approximately $10.8 million of additional new investments during the third quarter of 2017. 76% of the fair value of our loan portfolio was floating rate, and the weighted average yield of our loan portfolio was 11.66% as of June 30, 2017 [(2)] . 100% of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average cost of 3.73% as of June 30, 2017; over 95% of our debt matures in 2022 and beyond. On August 1, 2017, OFS Capital's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.34 per share for the third quarter of 2017, payable on September 29, 2017 to stockholders of record as of September 15, 2017. ""We believe that we are well positioned to grow earnings given the strength of our balance sheet,"" said Bilal Rashid, OFS Capital's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""At the end of the first quarter, we offered new shares of common stock resulting in approximately $53.7 million raised through the common stock offering. Since the offering, we closed $76.6 million in investments. Our commitment to strong, long-term performance is enhanced by the alignment of interests of our stockholders and our external manager, which continues to own approximately 2.9 million shares, or 22% of the outstanding OFS Capital common stock.""    (1) Supplemental information regarding adjusted net investment income: On a supplemental basis, we disclose adjusted net investment income (""Adjusted NII"") (including on a per share basis), which is a financial measure calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America (“non-GAAP”). Adjusted NII represents net investment income excluding the net capital gains incentive fee in periods in which they occur including the effect of reversals of previously accrued capital gains incentive fees . Our management agreement with OFS Capital Management, LLC (""OFS Advisor"") provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses for such year. Management believes that Adjusted NII is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any net capital gains incentive fee, as net investment income does not include gains associated with the capital gains incentive fee. In addition, management believes that providing Adjusted NII may facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into OFS Capital’s ongoing operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period, and afford investors a view of results that may be more easily compared to those of other companies. Reconciliations of net investment income to Adjusted NII are set forth in Schedule I. (2) See Highlights contained in this press release for further information on our weighted average yield. Including assets on non- accrual, the weighted average yield of our debt investment portfolio was 11.04% at June 30, 2017.   HIGHLIGHTS ($ in millions, except for per share data) Portfolio Overview                 At June 30, 2017 Total assets               $             349.0 Investment portfolio, at fair value $ 296.9 Net assets $ 192.0 Net asset value per share $ 14.40 Weighted average yield [(1)] 11.66 %   (1) The weighted average yield on our debt investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest plus the annualized accretion of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees, divided by (b) amortized cost of debt investments, excluding assets on non-accrual basis as of the balance sheet date. Including assets on non-accrual, the weighted average yield of our debt investment portfolio was 11.04% at June 30, 2017. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses.           Quarter ended June 30, Operating Results       2017   2016 Total investment income $ 8.0 $ 7.7 Net investment income $ 4.3 $ 3.5 Net investment income per common share, basic and diluted $ 0.33 $ 0.36 Adjusted net investment income (a Non-GAAP measure    described below) $ 4.0 $ 3.5 Adjusted net investment income (a Non-GAAP measure    described below) per share, basic and diluted $ 0.31 $ 0.36 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations $ (2.3 ) $ 4.3                                       Quarter ended June 30, Portfolio Activity                                 2017   2016 Number of new portfolio companies 6 3 Investments in new portfolio companies $ 59.1 $ 9.1 Investments in existing portfolio companies $ 7.0 $ 8.2 Number of portfolio companies at end of period 42 37     PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES During the second quarter of 2017, OFS Capital closed $58.8 million of new senior secured debt investments in six new portfolio companies, and a $0.3 million new preferred equity investment made in conjunction with a senior secured debt investment. In addition, OFS Capital closed $6.5 million of new senior secured debt investments in four existing portfolio companies, and a $0.5 million preferred equity investment in an existing portfolio company. The total fair value of OFS Capital’s investment portfolio was $296.9 million at June 30, 2017, which was equal to approximately 99% of amortized cost. As of June 30, 2017, the fair value of OFS Capital's debt investment portfolio totaled $259.1 million in 40 portfolio companies, of which 78% and 22% were senior secured loans and subordinated loans, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, we also held approximately $37.8 million in equity investments, at fair value, in 17 portfolio companies in which we also held debt investments and two portfolio company in which we solely held an equity investment. We had unfunded commitments of $2.1 million to three portfolio companies at June 30, 2017. As of June 30, 2017, floating rate loans comprised 76% of OFS Capital’s debt investment portfolio, with the remaining 24% in fixed rate loans, as a percentage of fair value. FOLLOW-ON PUBLIC OFFERING In April 2017, we issued 3,625,000 shares of our common stock in a follow-on public offering at an offering price of $14.57 per share (the ""Offering""), including shares purchased by the underwriters pursuant to their exercise of the over-allotment option. OFS Advisor paid all of the underwriting discounts and commissions and an additional supplemental payment of $0.25 per share, representing the difference between the public offering price of $14.57 per share and the net offering proceeds of $14.82 per share, which also represented our NAV per share at the time of the Offering. All payments made by OFS Advisor in connection with the Offering are not subject to reimbursement by us. We received net proceeds from this Offering of $53.7 million RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Income Interest Income: Interest income increased by $0.4 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $0.6 million increase caused by a 10% increase in the average outstanding loan balance, offset by a $0.1 million decrease caused by a 2% decrease in our weighted average yield in our portfolio, and a $0.1 million decrease in Net Loan Fee (loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees) amortization. Acceleration of Net Loan Fees of $0.1 million and $0.2 million were included in interest income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Fee Income: Fee income decreased by $0.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to a $0.2 million decrease in prepayment fees, offset by a $0.1 million increase in structuring fees. We recorded prepayment fees of $0.2 million resulting from $11.3 million of unscheduled principal payments during the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to prepayment fees of $0.4 million resulting from $12.7 million of unscheduled principal payments we recorded during the three months ended June 30, 2016. We recorded structuring fees of $0.2 million in connection with the closing of $18.3 million of investments during the three months ended June 30, 2017 compared to structuring fees of $0.1 million in connection with the closing of $5.0 million of investments during the three months ended June 30, 2016. Expenses Management fee expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017, increased over the corresponding period in the prior year due to an increase in our average total assets, primarily due to a increase in net investment activity, including additional deployment of funds from the Offering. Incentive fee expense decreased by $0.9 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $0.3 decrease in accrued capital gains incentive fee during three months ended June 30, 2017, which represents the reversal of accrued capital gains incentive fees at March 31, 2017, and a $0.6 million decrease in the Part One incentive fee (based on net investment income), due to a share issuance adjustment related to the Offering, determined by adjusting the value of net assets, at March 31, 2017 by the daily weighted average of the Offering proceeds available to us during the three months ended June 30, 2017. General and administrative fee expenses increased by $0.2 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the three months ended June 30, 2016, primarily due to the write-off of deferred offering costs in connection with the expiration of the related shelf registration statement. Net gain (loss) on investments Net gain (loss) on investments consists of the sum of: (a) realized gains and losses from the sale of debt or equity securities, or the redemption of equity securities; and (b) changes in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation on debt and equity investments. In the period in which a realized gain or loss is recognized, such gain or loss will generally be offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized appreciation or depreciation, and the net gain recognized in that period will generally be smaller. The unrealized appreciation or depreciation on debt securities is also reversed when those investments are redeemed or paid off prior to maturity. In such instances, the reversal of unrealized appreciation or depreciation will be reported as a net loss or gain, respectively, and may be partially offset by the acceleration of any premium or discount on the debt security in interest income and any prepayment fees on the debt security in fee income. We recognized net losses of $2.6 million on senior secured debt during the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors, including an unrealized loss of $3.0 million recognized on our senior secured debt investment in My Alarm Center, LLC, which was placed on non-accrual at June 30, 2017, partially offset by the positive impact of changes to certain market loan indices. A cumulative unrealized loss of $5.0 million at June 30, 2017, on My Alarm Center, LLC was realized subsequent to June 30, 2017 upon restructure of our senior secured debt investment and will be reflected in our third quarter financial statements. We recognized net losses of $2.1 million on subordinated debt during the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors, including an unrealized loss of $1.4 million recognized on our subordinated debt investment in Community Intervention Services, Inc., which was placed on non-accrual during 2016. We recognized net losses of $0.3 million on preferred equity investments for the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the net negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors, offset by the net positive impact from changes to EBITDA multiples used in our valuations. We recognized net losses of $1.5 million on common equity and warrant investments for the three months ended June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors. Included in the net loss was a realized gain of $0.9 million from the sale of a common equity investment, which through March 31, 2017, we recognized unrealized gains of $0.7 million, resulting in a net gain of $0.2 million during the three months ended June 30, 2017. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At June 30, 2017, we had $46.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $149.9 million in outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures. As of June 30, 2017, we had $19.0 million available for additional borrowings on our senior secured revolving credit facility with Pacific Western Bank and had drawn all of our available SBA-guaranteed debentures.

Adjusted NII represents net investment income excluding the net capital gains incentive fee in periods in which they occur, including the effect of reversals of previously accrued capital gains incentive fees. Our management agreement with OFS Advisor provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses for such year. Management believes that Adjusted NII is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any net capital gains incentive fee, as net investment income does not include gains associated with the capital gains incentive fee. In addition, management believes that providing Adjusted NII may facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into OFS Capital’s ongoing operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period, and afford investors a view of results that may be more easily compared to those of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation from net investment income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted NII for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data):   Quarter ended June 30, 2017     2016 Net investment income $ 4,316 $ 3,457   Capital gains incentive fee (283) [(1)] —   Adjusted net investment income $ 4,033 $ 3,457   Adjusted net investment income per common share: Basic and diluted $ 0.31 $ 0.36   Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic and diluted 13,197,759 9,692,346   (1) Represents the reversal of accrued capital gains incentive fees at March 31, 2017.

OFS,"CHICAGO, May 05, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OFS Capital Corporation OFS, -0.98% (“OFS Capital”, “we”, “us”, or “our”) today announced its financial results for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2017. FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Net investment income of $3.3 million, or $0.34 per share. Adjusted net investment income of $3.6 million, or $0.37 per share, which approximated 110% of our distribution for the first quarter, representing the eighth straight quarter our adjusted net investment income covered the distribution [(1)] . Net asset value (""NAV"") increased to $14.98 per share at March 31, 2017 from $14.82 per share at December 31, 2016 and there were no cash non-accruals. Two-thirds of our loan portfolio was floating rate and the weighted average yield of our loan portfolio was 12.03% as of March 31, 2017. 100% of our debt is fixed rate with a weighted average cost of 3.60% as of March 31, 2017; 95% of our debt matures in 2022 and beyond. Closed investments totaled $6.1 million in the first quarter of 2017; as of May 5, 2017, we closed approximately $29.0 million of additional new investments during the second quarter of 2017. On May 2, 2017, OFS Capital's Board of Directors declared a distribution of $0.34 per share for the second quarter of 2017, payable on June 30, 2017 to stockholders of record as of June 16, 2017. ""We are pleased that our NAV increased from the end of 2016,"" said Bilal Rashid, OFS Capital's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “At the end of the first quarter, we raised approximately $53.7 million through a common stock offering to help fund our investment pipeline. We believe that the larger equity base also improves our risk profile and scale. We are optimistic about the future given the strength of our direct origination and underwriting platform. Our commitment to strong, long-term performance is enhanced by the alignment of interests of our stockholders and our external manager, which continues to own approximately 2.9 million shares, or 22% of the outstanding OFS Capital common stock."" (1) Supplemental information regarding adjusted net investment income: On a supplemental basis, we disclose adjusted net investment income (""Adjusted NII"") (including on a per share basis), which is a financial measure calculated and presented on a basis of methodology other than in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles of the United States of America (“non-GAAP”). Adjusted NII represents net investment income excluding the net capital gains incentive fee (fee adjustments) in periods in which they occur. Our management agreement with OFS Capital Management, LLC (""OFS Advisor"") provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses for such year. Management believes that Adjusted NII is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any net capital gains incentive fee, as net investment income does not include gains associated with the capital gains incentive fee. In addition, management believes that providing Adjusted NII may facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into OFS Capital’s ongoing operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period, and afford investors a view of results that may be more easily compared to those of other companies. Reconciliations of net investment income to Adjusted NII are set forth in Schedule I. HIGHLIGHTS   ($ in millions, except for per share data)   Portfolio Overview At March 31, 2017 Total assets $ 307.4 Investment portfolio, at fair value $ 258.3 Net assets $ 145.4 Net asset value per share $ 14.98 Weighted average yield (1) 12.03 %   (1) The weighted average yield on our debt investments is computed as (a) the annual stated accruing interest plus the annualized accretion of loan origination fees, original issue discount, market discount or premium, and loan amendment fees, divided by (b) amortized cost of debt investments, excluding assets on non-accrual basis as of the balance sheet date. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our fees and expenses.   Quarter ended March 31, Operating Results 2017   2016 Total investment income $ 8.0 $ 7.8 Net investment income $ 3.3 $ 3.7 Net investment income per common share, basic and diluted $ 0.34 $ 0.38 Adjusted net investment income (a Non-GAAP measure described below) $ 3.6 $ 3.5 Adjusted net investment income (a Non-GAAP measure described below) per share, basic and diluted $ 0.37 $ 0.36 Net increase in net assets resulting from operations $ 4.9 $ 2.3     Quarter ended March 31, Portfolio Activity 2017     2016 Number of new portfolio companies —   — Investments in new portfolio companies $ — $ — Investments in existing portfolio companies $ 6.1 $ 6.5 Number of portfolio companies at end of period 38 36   PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES During the first quarter of 2017, OFS Capital closed $6.1 million of new senior secured debt investments in five existing portfolio companies, which included a delayed draw funding of $0.5 million. The total fair value of OFS Capital’s investment portfolio was $258.3 million at March 31, 2017, which was equal to approximately 102% of amortized cost. As of March 31, 2017, the fair value of OFS Capital's debt investment portfolio totaled $217.3 million in 36 portfolio companies, of which 76% and 24% were senior secured loans and subordinated loans, respectively. As of March 31, 2017, we also held approximately $41.0 million in equity investments, at fair value, in 17 portfolio companies in which we also held debt investments and two portfolio company in which we solely held an equity investment. We had unfunded commitments of $2.1 million to three portfolio companies at March 31, 2017. As of March 31, 2017, floating rate loans comprised 67% of OFS Capital’s debt investment portfolio, with the remaining 33% in fixed rate loans, as a percentage of fair value. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Interest Income: Interest income increased by $0.5 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $0.6 million increase caused by a 10% increase in the average outstanding loan balance, offset by a $0.1 million decrease caused by a 1% decrease in our weighted average yield in our portfolio for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Acceleration of Net Loan Fees of $0.1 million and $0.1 million were included in interest income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Fee Income: Fee income decreased by $0.3 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to a decrease in prepayment fees. We recorded prepayment fees of $0.2 million resulting from $16.9 million of unscheduled principal payments during the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to prepayment fees of $0.5 million resulting from $11.5 million of unscheduled principal payments we recorded during the three months ended March 31, 2016. Expenses Incentive fee expense increased by $0.4 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in the accrued Capital Gains Fee during three months ended March 31, 2017. During the three months ended March 31, 2017 we recorded a Capital Gains Fee of $0.3 million compared to a Capital Gains Fee of $(0.1) million recorded during three months ended March 31, 2016, which represents the reversal of the accrued Capital Gains Fee at December 31, 2015. Net gain (loss) on investments Net gain (loss) on investments consists of the sum of: (a) realized gains and losses from the sale of debt or equity securities, or the redemption of equity securities; and (b) changes in net unrealized appreciation/depreciation on debt and equity investments. In the period in which a realized gain or loss is recognized, such gain or loss will generally be offset by the reversal of previously recognized unrealized appreciation or depreciation, and the net gain recognized in that period will generally be smaller. The unrealized appreciation or depreciation on debt securities is also reversed when those investments are redeemed or paid off prior to maturity. In such instances, the reversal on unrealized appreciation or depreciation will be reported as a net loss or gain, respectively, and may be partially offset by the acceleration of any premium or discount on the debt security in interest income and any prepayment fees on the debt security in fee income. We recognized net losses of $1.6 million on senior secured debt during the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the impact of changes to EBITDA multiples used in our valuations, offset by the positive impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors. We recognized net losses of $0.2 million on subordinated debt during the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the net impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors. We recognized net gains of $3.0 million on preferred equity investments for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the net impact of changes to EBITDA multiples used in our valuations and the net positive impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors. We recognized net gains of $0.4 million on common equity and warrant investments for the three months ended March 31, 2017, primarily as a result of the impact of changes to EBITDA multiples used in our valuations, offset primarily by the net negative impact of portfolio company-specific performance factors. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES At March 31, 2017, we had $44.1 million in cash and cash equivalents and $149.9 million in outstanding SBA-guaranteed debentures. As of March 31, 2017, we had $16.3 million available for additional borrowings on our senior secured revolving credit facility with Pacific Western Bank and had drawn all of our available SBA-guaranteed debentures. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS In April 2017, we completed a public offering of 3,625,000 shares of our common stock at a public offering price of $14.57 per share (the ""Offering""). OFS Advisor paid all of the underwriters' sales load and an additional supplemental payment of $0.25 per share, reflecting the difference between the public offering price of $14.57 per share and the net proceeds of $14.82 per share, which also represented the Company's NAV per share at the time of the Offering. All payments made by OFS Advisor are not subject to reimbursement by us. We received net proceeds from this offering of approximately $53.7 million.

Adjusted NII represents net investment income excluding the net capital gains incentive fee (fee adjustments) in periods in which they occur. Our management agreement with OFS Advisor provides that a capital gains incentive fee is determined and paid annually with respect to realized capital gains (but not unrealized capital gains) to the extent such realized capital gains exceed realized and unrealized capital losses for such year. Management believes that Adjusted NII is a useful indicator of operations exclusive of any net capital gains incentive fee, as net investment income does not include gains associated with the capital gains incentive fee. In addition, management believes that providing Adjusted NII may facilitate a more complete analysis and greater transparency into OFS Capital’s ongoing operations, particularly in comparing underlying results from period to period, and afford investors a view of results that may be more easily compared to those of other companies. The following table provides a reconciliation from net investment income (the most comparable GAAP measure) to Adjusted NII for the periods presented (dollar amounts in thousands, except per share data):   Quarter ended March 31, 2017   2016 Net investment income $ 3,340 $ 3,655   Capital gains incentive fee 283 (139 )   Adjusted net investment income $ 3,623   $ 3,516     Adjusted net investment income per common share: Basic and diluted $ 0.37   $ 0.36     Weighted average shares outstanding: Basic and diluted 9,700,329   9,691,183     ABOUT OFS CAPITAL OFS Capital Corporation is an externally managed, closed-end, non-diversified management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company.
