ACIA,"Shares of Acacia Communications Inc. ACIA, +3.22% are down 4.1% in Friday trading after analysts at Morgan Stanley downgraded the stock to underweight from equal weight. The analysts, led by Meta Marshall, worry about the company's data communications exposure. ""While [data communications] demand remains strong, headwinds include push for lighter weight equipment and architectural alternatives, meaning profit pool for systems vendors likely to only grow modestly if at all,"" Marshall wrote. She also initiated coverage of several other optical names, including overweight-rated II-VI Inc. IIVI, +3.54% which she likes for its ""exposure to industrial, telecom, and 3D sensing."" Marshall began coverage of Oclaro Inc. OCLR, +1.70% and Finisar Corp. FNSR, +4.84% with equal weight ratings.

ACIA,"Acacia Communications Inc. ACIA, +3.22% fell more than 10% in late trading Thursday after disclosing quarterly financial performance, the second consecutive day that an optical-networking company took a big post-earnings hit. The company reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $20.4 million, or 52 cents a share, on sales of $86.6 million, down nearly 40% from $142.4 million a year ago. After adjusting primarily for changes to the U.S. tax law and stock-based compensation, Acacia claimed earnings of 27 cents a share, down from 94 cents a share a year ago. Analysts on average had expected adjusted earnings of 25 cents a share on sales of $88.4 million. The company's forecast predicts more declines: Acacia sees adjusted earnings of a penny to 10 cents a share in the current quarter on sales of $67 million to $74 million, which would again be stark declines from the year-earlier period. Analysts on average were expecting first-quarter adjusted profit of 28 cents a share on sales of $93.2 million, according to FactSet. Acacia's decline comes a day after Applied Optoelectronics disappointed with its own earnings, and shares of that company declined more than 20% in Thursday trading. Optical-networking companies had been hot amid a data-center boom that required their products.

ACIA,"Acacia Communications Inc. ACIA, +3.22% plummeted 17% in late trading Thursday after the networking company projected sharply lower earnings and revenue than Wall Street expected. Acacia, which went public in May amid a sudden resurgence in investor demand for optical-networking companies, reported net income of $64.5 million, or $1.55 a share, on sales of $142.4 million. After adjustments for stock-based compensation, Acacia reported adjusted earnings of 94 cents a share. That performance easily beat average analyst forecasts of 90 cents a share in adjusted earnings on sales of $139.7 million, according to FactSet, but Acacia's forecast fell far short of expectations.

ACIA,"If “The Graduate” had been set in the late 1990s, Dustin Hoffman’s young protagonist might have heard these two words of advice: fiber optics. Major leaps forward in the development of fiber optics was a core underpinning of the growth of the internet and helped fuel the optical-networking sector to explode—and then implode—at the turn of the 21st century. Like most component and semiconductor markets, this sector is extremely cyclical—as soon as the first big internet build-out pushed optical-networking companies to outlandish valuations, the cycle ended and they came crashing down amid the massive telecommunications bust. The timing of the current cycle is the big question for investors who are now benefiting from another boom in optical networking, thanks to internet growth in China, new cloud-focused data center infrastructure and big trans-ocean fiber optic cable projects like the one announced in May in development under the Atlantic Ocean by Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +2.10% and Facebook Inc. FB, +4.42% as well as Alphabet Inc.’s GOOG, +2.71% GOOGL, +3.18%  ongoing Google Fiber installation project. The boom in optical-networking stocks last quarter is unlike anything they’ve experienced since the dot-com bust. In recent months, shares of these optical-networking companies have gained at least 70%, with one more than doubling: Oclaro Corp. OCLR, +1.70% OCLR, +1.70% NeoPhotonics Corp. NPTN, +13.98% Applied Optoelectronics Inc. AAOI, +5.96% Finisar Corp. FNSR, +4.84% and Lumentum Holdings Inc. LITE, +2.57% . Even amid a drought for initial public offerings among tech companies, Acacia Communications Inc. ACIA, +3.22% managed to debut in the sector in mid-May, and that stock is up 233% since. Oclaro Inc.11 Jul25 Jul8 Aug22 Aug5 Sep19 SepSource: Dow Jones Market Data US:OCLR US:NPTN US:AAOI US:FNSR US:LITE 0% 25% 50% 75% 100% In a recent note, Cowen & Co. analyst Paul Silverstein was fully aware that investors are leery of a sector that saw an estimated $1 trillion loss in market value during the dot-com bust. But he still touted the current demand cycle for companies like Oclaro and Applied Optoelectronics and gave many convincing data points in a 58-page initiation report on Oclaro. “At the risk of uttering the four most dangerous words in the investment lexicon, regarding the critical issue of the duration of the current optical upgrade cycle, we think the nature of this cycle is different this time,” Silverstein wrote. He added that, while the nature of the business of these companies is cyclical, the current cycle is too strong to ignore. “To be clear, current end demand and the near-term outlook for optical systems and components is not uniform across all product, customer or regional markets; by extension, nor is it uniform across all vendors,” Silverstein wrote. “That said, virtually all optical industry participants that we met with or heard from cited strong demand and/or underlying demand drivers with no letup in sight.” Indeed, many of these new companies have roots in the first telecom/internet boom and bust, and investors appear to be hoping that their education during one of the most memorable busts will help them proceed more cautiously during another boom time. Oclaro, the big focus of Silverstein’s note, has been led since 2013 by Greg Dougherty, who served briefly as chief operating officer of JDS Uniphase, a company that was the poster child for the incredible rise and disastrous fall of the optical-networking sector. Dougherty joined JDS after one of the biggest mergers of the era, when JDS bought rival SDL, where he was COO, for about $41 billion in stock. Silverstein noted that Dougherty and Chief Financial Officer Pete Mangan “have led a breathtaking turnaround” of a company that is now an “early market leader in the highest growth component of the optical component sector.” JDS Uniphase survived the lean years since the bust, but not entirely intact. Lumentum is the old JDS laser and optical networking components business that was separated from JDS along with Viavi Solutions Inc. VIAV, +2.53% In its most recent earnings call last month, Lumentum CEO Alan Lowe noted that revenue in its 100 gigabit datacom business had surged 241%, while its business selling reconfigurable multiplexers for optical networks was up nearly 100%. Overall, revenue growth in the most recent quarter was 15.7%. “Increasingly, network and data center operators around the world are critically dependent upon our products,” Lowe told analysts in early August. He said demand from China continued to be strong, and full-scale deployments in North American metropolitan areas were ramping up. NeoPhotonics has an even longer history. Initially founded in 1996 to develop nanomaterials, the company became NeoPhotonics in 2002 and spun out its non-telecom businesses. Since 2003, it has been buying companies to expand its technologies, starting with its purchase of Lightwave Microwave Systems. In the past few months, NeoPhontonics has received serious attention on Wall Street, including from Michael Burry, the hedge-fund investor known for his early prediction of the housing market collapse, as chronicled in Michael Lewis’s book “The Big Short.” According to a regulatory filing in August, Burry’s Scion Asset Management bought 300,000 shares of NeoPhotonics as he dumped his Apple stake and loaded up on Alphabet. Last month, at an analyst meeting, the company forecast revenue growth of 25%-plus from 2017 to 2019, as revenue from China and other metro markets surges. “Welcome to the second inning of the Optical Super Cycle,” Alex Henderson, an analyst at Needham & Co., wrote in upgrading NeoPhotonics to a strong buy over the summer. Investors looking for deals in this group may have a hard time after the booming quarter they just experienced. Most of these stocks are now trading at higher growth multiples than other tech holdovers from the dot-com era. Finisar and Lumentum, for example, are trading at 22 times and 26 times 2016 earnings estimates, respectively, while Oclaro trades at about 31 times 2016 estimates. Newly public Acacia trades around 38 times its 2016 estimates, while Applied Optoelectronics is trading at 30 times 2016 estimates and NeoPhotonics is trading at 24.5 times its annual earnings estimates. In addition, investors are likely to remain jittery about this sector after the carnage of 2000-2001. Cowen’s Silverstein, well aware of the potential for skepticism, noted several factors for his call on Oclaro. He said that a few markets for 100 gigabit optical networking components are in the early stages of a multiyear upgrade cycle, and cited Infonetics/IHS market research data that predicts compound annual growth rates of 30% to 60% for certain equipment. Optical networking is a complex sector that is hard to understand for non-techies, and the current prices of many of these stocks may be a deterrent. But if we are still early in a “super cycle,” they could still be worth a look, and investors with a long timeline may want to jump in if these stocks bust yet again.

ACIA,"Shares continue to give a good account of themselves. Volume has dropped off due to the many vacationing investors. Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2016 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. The key distinction that separates this intermediate-term advance from those that immediately preceded it is the stand-up action of speculative growth stocks. This is your risk-on mindset talking. In particular, a number of recent new issues have recorded blistering breakouts, including Acacia Communications ACIA, +3.22% Twilio TWLO, +2.00% Weibo WB, +3.87% and Yirendai YRD, +3.77% Issues with a little more seasoning that have asserted themselves as leaders include Gigamon US:GIMO Lumentum Holdings LITE, +2.57% Nevro NVRO, +0.53% Penumbra PEN, +1.40% Sina SINA, +4.55% and Veeva Systems VEEV, +2.17% Every bull market needs a certain amount of speculative sentiment, or risk-taking. Seeing growth stocks like the above prance all over the tape goes a long way toward solidifying the health of this market. Of course, too much of a good thing can be disastrous, as is seen late in most bull markets. The above go-go names may be in vogue now, but experienced speculators recognize that these same issues are the ones most likely to fall the hardest when this bull is done. Among the names, Minerva Neurosciences NERV, -1.57% is a younger biotech concern that came public a little over two years ago at $6. Shares of the developer of central nervous system disorders peaked recently at $15.84. While this is a development-stage outfit with no revenue or earnings, very aggressive speculators may note the constructive technical formation of a cup. This pattern follows the 359% jump in a five-day period during May-June. Price will more than likely pull back to form a handle to go with its cup. Speculators who don't mind trading off the chart alone, with no fundamentals to lean on, should watch for this pullback as a means of obtaining a toehold in the stock. As always, a protective stop should be used to mitigate risk, along with a starter position that is half normal size, or less. This initial position could be added to if the stock proves itself. This is clearly a very speculative issue, all the more so due to its being teen-priced and its having a $465 million market capitalization and $6.8 million average daily dollar volume ($25 million and up in ADDV is preferred here). However, big winners in bull markets that favor growth shares often come from so-called new merchandise names like this. Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2016 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. Healthequity HQY, +0.10% is a classic growth stock. The Utah-based company provides online platforms for helping consumers oversee their tax-advantaged healthcare savings. Most Wall Street analysts forecast 41% earnings growth in the January 2017 fiscal year, followed by another 31% in the 2018 fiscal year. Revenue growth has been stellar. Rates of 46%, 40%, 44%, and 47% have been posted in the last four quarters, respectively. Technically, HQY forms a six-week cup inside of a larger, nine-month consolidation. An aggressive speculator may consider using the $31.69 high of this smaller cup as an entrance pivot for a breakout play. While HQY has outperformed the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%   handily over the past three months (30% to 7%), it possesses an 81st percentile relative strength rank over the last year. This is less than the 90 to 99 that is preferred. Moreover, the shares are under modest accumulation, not the solid-to-strong accumulation that is ideal. While these metrics leave a little something to be desired, they reflect the state of a market that has gone straight up for eight weeks. For the vast majority of fundamentally sound growth issues have already cleared bases and made their move. Pending a general market reaction or correction that would allow names to form new bases, titles like NERV and HQY are what is left. Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2016 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. For those who push the envelope in terms of risk and potential reward, the Direxion Energy Bull 3x ERX, +6.34%   just came out of a 10-week consolidation on volume 22% above average. While this amount of activity is a bit light for a stock on its breakout day, the general slowness of trading during these late-summer sessions merits a mention. In other words, Thursday's volume can be ignored. Very aggressive speculators might consider entering a half-sized position around Thursday's closing level of $33.86. A potential protective stop might be placed just below the 20-day exponential moving average, which equates to 10% risk. With a half-sized position, this amounts to about 5% de facto risk. Less aggressive players might think of using its unleveraged cousin, S&P Select Energy SPDR XLE, +2.11% Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2016 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. Gol Intelligent Airlines GOL, +4.76% was discussed earlier this month (""For very aggressive speculators... the July 21 high of 18.46 might be considered as an entrance pivot for a breakout play.""). Since then, the stock broke out and is 14% past the 18.46 level. GOL should not be chased since it is past the 5% demarcation point at which a stock becomes extended beyond its most recent support area, thereby representing unacceptable risk. In the coming days and weeks, GOL will likely be a good candidate for a pullback entrance. The best pullback candidates are in strongly trending titles — but not rocket ships — that pause due to inevitable profit-taking. Rocket ships aren't suitable because the supply-demand quotient gets out of whack in an extreme manner. GOL checks all the boxes. It is a strong trender, has a 99th percentile relative strength rank over the last year, and is under extreme accumulation (focused buying). It may not be buyable at present, but it is watchable for pullback players who don't mind a stock trading a long way from its 52-week high. Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2016 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. In sum, as was noted in the last column, the action of leading growth stocks has been superb. This is an objective measure of the speculative sentiment, or the aptitude of market participants to take risk. Outside of some short-term weakness that is to be expected, shares are on good footing and further upward revaluation is anticipated.

ACIA,"One of the year’s rare technology initial public offerings and the only unicorn to go public this year has almost quadrupled in price in less than two months. Shares of Twilio Inc. TWLO, +2.00%  a cloud communications platform, were trading at $56.30, putting it 263% above the company’s $15 issue price as of Thursday’s close. The move underscores an overall uptick in the IPO market, with the year’s nine technology offerings garnering an average return of 119%, according to Renaissance Capital, a manager of IPO-focused ETFs. Other technology IPOs so far this year have included Acacia Communications Inc. ACIA, +3.22%  , a high-speed communication company, which has nearly doubled the past month, and Line Corp. LN, +2.23%  , a Japanese messaging app, which has soared 29% in the past month. The S&P SPX, +1.38%  has gained 1% during the same period. Matthew Kennedy, an analyst at Renaissance Capital, said the performance of these offerings can be attributed to a combination of an improving market and a hunger for IPOs among investors in a depressed IPO market. But he says it could also signal a shift in investor sentiment, where they’re looking for fast-growing companies verses those that are profitable. “It could be a shift from value to growth,” Kennedy said. Kennedy notes, however, that both Twilio and Talend S.A. TLND, +2.12% a company that provides big data and cloud services for companies,reported cash-flow positive quarters before going public. These big gains should pave the way for more technology IPOs this year, likely launching after Labor Day, while the bigger unicorns, which are private companies valued at $1 billion or more, such as Uber and Lyft will likely wait until 2017 or later. “It’s definitely a good sign for the tech IPOs on file,” he said. Nutanix, a visualization and storage company, and PointClickCare, an electronic health care company, are two of the technology IPOs that could come out, he said. Graphic embed is no longer available. Still Twilio is only one of three IPOs to price above its range this year and the only U.S. billion-dollar company to test the public market so far this year, according to Renaissance. Twilio stock also had a strong debut on its first day of trading June 23, with the stock soaring 92% and pricing above range the day before.That marked the best day for a technology IPO since Castlight Health in March 2014, Renaissance said.

ACIA,"Shares in the Nasdaq Composite, showing scant respect for the concept of gravity, wrapped up the first real pause of their potent four-week rally by powering higher July 20. In the process, the Nasdaq Composite, an outperformer in 13 of the past 18 sessions, has shown near-perfect price-volume correlation. Prices have risen on generally higher volumes, while easing on mostly lighter activity. This is an objective indication that profit-taking has been minimal on that impressive run. Chart created using TradeStation. With breadth, discussed at length in the past two columns, quite solid and amid ample leadership, there is no reason why the market rally cannot continue over the intermediate-term (several weeks to several months). Of course, short-term reactions of 3%-5% should always be expected of any advance. These are viewed as healthy and necessary in order to keep everyone honest. Within the list, technology XLK, +1.98% and telecommunications IYZ, +1.27% have shown the best tone over the intermediate-term. Among narrow groups, semiconductors SMH, +2.05% excel. When looking at the top 10 narrow industry groups of the 197 in the O'Neil database, six are of the late-cycle type, i.e. they normally lead late in a bull market amid a mature economy. (Please see the table below.) These include mining, metals and energy segments. Table created using MarketSmith. The only bona fide growth group in the Top 10 is telecom — fiber optics, with its 96th percentile rank for relative strength over the past six months. Here, the top actors are Acacia Communications ACIA, +3.22% a recent new issue that nearly doubled in its opening five weeks, and Lumentum Holdings LITE, +2.57% discussed below. Acacia, a maker of equipment for cloud-infrastructure operators, is a classic growth stock that reminds one of what was routinely seen in the growth sector of the 1990s: major earnings growth estimates for this year and next, and sizzling revenue growth. Unfortunately, the name does not offer attractive entrance due to it being materially extended above its most recent area of support. However, intermediate-term players can add it to a watch list for monitoring. Along with Twilio TWLO, +2.00% another cloud play, it is among the top two or three most compelling of the recent group of initial offerings. Both are watchable, but not actionable. Among the names, LITE is a top performer in the telecom-fiber optics group, a top-performing industry group. This column has always been about a bottoms-up approach, favoring top actors regardless of their industry group strength. Lumentum is actually an example of top-down analysis, going from market to group to stock. LITE has recorded triple-digit annually compounded earnings growth over the past three years. Most seers on Wall Street look for the June 2016 fiscal year to come in at 60%, with another 29% expected for the June 2017 year. A weakness is revenue growth. In seven of the past eight quarters, sales have grown at 4% or less. The most recent quarter is an exception, coming in at 16%. LITE's chart shows a price nearing the top of a three-month double-bottom base. An aggressive speculator may consider using the base top of 27.91 set on April 8 as a potential entrance for a breakout play. Ideally, the stock does nothing for at least several days before a breakout attempt. As always, a protective stop should be used to mitigate risk, along with a starter position that is half normal size, or less. This initial position could be added to if the stock proves itself. Chart created using MarketSmith. Facebook FB, +4.42% while boasting superb fundamentals in the way of top- and bottom-line growth as well as expected earnings growth for this year and next, is not a name that warrants a fresh-money buy. Specifically, FB has only slightly outperformed the S&P 500 since the June 27 market low (11% to 9%), it has only shown a modicum of accumulation (concerted buying) over the past two months, and its relative strength line (see chart below) is substantially lagging the stock's price. (While LITE's RS line is also lagging its stock price, LITE stock has handily beaten the S&P 500 since the June 27 market low, 23% to 9%.) On July 20, it broke out of its nine-week base on volume that was only average. While the stock may well continue higher, it is unlikely to be a real leader in a market that for some time has shunned most liquid glamours. Chart created using MarketSmith. In summation, the price-volume behavior of the Nasdaq Composite has been impressive during the four-week rally, with volume rising on up days in price and turnover drying up when prices ease. This objectively shows a lack of worrisome profit-taking in the wake of the bulky run-up. While a 3%-5% reaction can be expected at any time during an advance in the averages, further upward revaluation is expected to obtain.

ACIA,"Getty Images Shares are on track for further upward revaluation, as the health of the average stock remains the key takeaway from recent market action. Last week's report emphasized ""...that a few breadth measures are now showing more health than they did in 2015."" The report went on to discuss three popular measures of average-stock health: the percentage of New York Stock Exchange issues above their 200-day moving average (at levels not seen in nearly two years), the cumulative daily NYSE advance/decline line, and the number of NYSE 52-week highs (the highest in 26 months). A fourth breadth measure, the 10-day net high/low differential, is shown below. This indicator, popularized by the great technician Justin Mamis, and rarely discussed anywhere, takes the difference between each day's 52-week highs and lows, and then smooths the result with a 10-day moving average. The resulting indicator is a good proxy for the average stock. Like other measures of breadth, divergences between a major average such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average or S&P 500 and this indicator provide a good picture of the technical health of the market. (Years ago, prior to the advent of charting software, this trader would plot the 10-day net high/low differential on a sheet of graph paper each evening.) For a larger chart, please click here.

The chart above shows the indicator diverging from the S&P in April-May, presaging the July-August downdraft in the averages. A second example of the value of this measure can be seen in February. Then the indicator showed uncommon strength amid weakness in the S&P. This positive divergence led to the booming February-April market advance. What is this intermediate-term indicator saying now? As the chart above shows, both the indicator and the S&P are setting new highs. The market generally does not get into trouble when it is ""in gear"" like it is now. It is when the average stock begins deteriorating beneath the surface of the major averages that market health takes a turn for the worse, usually leading to a major correction or outright bear market. As for the Nasdaq Composite, the chart below shows a distinct contraction in volatility (the intraday high/low range) over the past five sessions. This is not a surprise after the index broke through the top of its consolidation area without much of a pause prior to. This shrinkage in volatility and dry up in Nasdaq volume this past week indicate a modicum of profit-taking in the wake of the index's 10.3% run-up on an intraday basis post-Brexit.

A market in which leading stocks break down on their charts is a market usually treading on thin ice. Currently, leading stocks expected to post hefty earnings growth in 2017 have tended to act well post-breakout. Examples are Abiomed ABMD, +2.83% Acacia Communications ACIA, +3.22% MKS Instruments MKSI, +3.86% and Yirendai YRD, +3.77% Among the names, Eldorado Gold EGO, +3.27% is a low-priced Canadian explorer and producer of gold. The stock, priced at 4.85, is extremely speculative and should only be considered by very aggressive speculators who understand price action. Most Wall Street analysts who follow the company expect EGO to record an earnings-growth jump from an estimated three cents a share in 2016 to a forecasted 13 cents a share next year. However, in light of the extended nature of most gold miners' charts, the more important factor with EGO is the stock's eight-week base. The stock is ranked in the 96th percentile for relative price strength over the past year, while its industry group has earned a 99th percentile strength rank over the past six months. The shares are under extreme accumulation (concerted buying) over the intermediate term. Despite Eldorado's low share price, liquidity is solid, with average daily dollar volume at about $38 million and market capitalization at $3.5 billion. A very aggressive player may consider using the base top of 5.16 (the high of May 16 and 17) as an entrance pivot for a breakout play. Should EGO break out, patience should be exercised given the fact that there is a mound of overhead supply, i.e. resistance. Using the depth of the base, a measured move calculates a target of about 6.30. As always, a protective stop should be used to mitigate risk, along with a starter position that is half normal size, or less. This initial position could be added to if the stock proves itself. According to the company Web site, earnings are expected to be reported July 29. For a larger chart, please click here. Chart created using MarketSmith. ©2016 MarketSmith Incorporated. All rights reserved. U.S. Steel X, +4.92% has shown excellent relative price strength since the Feb. 11 market low, while earning a 97th percentile rank over the past year. Its group, steel producers, is ranked in the 99th percentile over the past six months. Last Tuesday, price broke out of a three-month base, up 5.5% on volume 20% more than average. There are a couple of entrance possibilities. The first would be to enter long around Friday's close of 21.68. Using a stop of just below the base top of 20.55 would equate to 5% risk, or less than 3% risk if a half-sized starter position is used. The preferred entrance would be on a pullback to between the 10- and 20-day moving averages. This would take advantage of the tendency for the first pullback following a breakout to be an opportune place to enter. On a measured move basis, a possible target would be the upper 20s.

As expected, the impressive performance of the average stock, i.e. breadth, led to last week's breakout by two of the three major averages from their multi-month basing formations. Momentum, or the internal strength of the market, has in essence bought the market some time before the inevitable divergences show up. Further upward revaluation is anticipated. While some may feel uncomfortable with the averages at new-high ground, strength begets strength.

ACIA,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7.Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations You should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates and beliefs. Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, particularly in the section titled ""Risk Factors."" Selling More Highly Integrated and Higher-Performance Products. Our results of operations have been, and we believe will continue to be, affected by our ability to design and sell more highly integrated products with improved performance and increased functionality. We aim to grow our revenue and expand our margins by enabling customers to transition from previously deployed 10 Gbps and 40 Gbps solutions to our 100 Gbps and 400 Gbps modules and demonstrate the value proposition to the growing number of metro and inter-data center network equipment designers and manufacturers. Our ability to maintain our current revenue levels and sustain our gross margins will depend, in part, upon our continued sales of our newer, more integrated and higher performance products, and our quarterly results of operations can be significantly impacted by the mix of products sold during the period. newer modules, which integrate our silicon PIC, will contribute higher gross profit over time than some of our older products, because the integration of our silicon PIC into these products eliminates the need for us to purchase several high-cost discrete components for the same level of functionality, thus improving margins on these products. In addition, we have shifted the manufacturing of the majority of our high volume products to contract manufacturers located in lower-cost regions, which generally decreases the cost of the manufacturing of these products and correspondingly improves margins. However, the current U.S. President, members of his Administration, and other public officials, including members of the current U.S. Congress, continue to signal a willingness to revise, renegotiate, or terminate various multilateral trade agreements under which U.S. companies currently exchange products and services around the world, and to impose new taxes on certain goods imported into the United States or other adverse consequences on companies importing certain goods into the United States. Since we rely primarily upon non-U.S. manufacturers to make our products, such steps, if adopted, could make our products more expensive and less competitive in the U.S. market. There can be no assurance that pending or future legislation or executive action in the United States that could significantly increase our cost of manufacturing our high volume products and decrease our margins will not be enacted. See Part I, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading ""Risks Related to our Business and Industry-We generate a significant portion of our revenue from international sales and rely on foreign manufacturers to make our products, and therefore are subject to additional risks associated with our international operations"" for further information. Sales, general and administrative expenses include salary and benefit expenses, including stock-based compensation, for employees and costs for contractors engaged in sales, marketing, customer service, technical support, and general and administrative activities, as well as the costs of legal and other professional services expenses, trade shows, marketing programs, promotional materials, bad debt expense, facilities, general liability insurance and travel. Over time, we expect our sales, general and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars primarily due to our continued efforts to expand our business. Other Income (Expense), Net Revenue Service, or IRS, and other tax authorities to determine the adequacy of our income tax reserves and expense. Should actual events or results differ from our then-current expectations, charges or credits to our provision for income taxes may become necessary. Any such adjustments could have a significant effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A ""Risk Factors"" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K under the heading ""Risks Related to our Business and Industry-The final determination of our income tax liability may be materially different from our income tax provision"" for further information.

ACIA,"MAYNARD, Mass., Mar 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Acacia Communications ACIA, +3.22% a leading provider of high-speed coherent optical interconnect products, today announced it is demonstrating its AC1200 Coherent Module at the Optical Fiber Communication Conference and Exhibition (OFC) taking place March 11 - March 15, 2018 at the San Diego Convention Center. Acacia's AC1200 module has been designed to offer flexible features to address a wide range of network applications, advanced monitoring to enable intelligent networks and improved performance to reduce network operating costs. Acacia's AC1200 module supports transmission speeds of up to 1.2 Tbps in a footprint that is 40% less than the size of the 5"" x 7"" modules supporting transmission speeds of 400 Gbps today. It is based on Acacia's Pico digital signal processor (DSP) ASIC, which is operating at 600 Gbps transmission speed, using 64QAM modulation for the demonstration, and utilizes two wavelengths that can be configured to support from 100 Gbps to 600 Gbps capacity each. Acacia's AC1200 module supports a suite of advanced three-dimensional (3D) shaping features that may be optimized to enable performance approaching theoretical limits on a wide range of network configurations. 3D shaping allows fine-tune adjustment of the modulation characteristics to provide network operators with the flexibility to customize the AC1200 transmission to their network requirements. The key features enabling 3D-shaping include: Shaping of the constellation points' probability to optimize capacity using Acacia's patented Fractional QAM modulation; Shaping of the constellation points' location to optimize reach; and Shaping of the spectral width to match the available channel passband by adapting the baud rate.  Acacia's AC1200 module also includes several features that enhance performance and give network operators the ability to take advantage of 3D-shaping: Flexible Client Interfaces - provides the flexibility to support a wide range of applications with 100GbE, 400GbE and FlexE interfaces to the host card. Enhanced Turbo Product Code SD-FEC - offers ultra-high net coding gain (NCG) and enables maximum reach, while maintaining low power dissipation. Internal Crossbar Switch - enables increased traffic flexibility, including transmission of three native 400GbE host signals on two wavelengths carrying 600Gbps each on the optical line; an important feature for edge DCI applications as cloud networks migrate to 400GbE. ""With our AC1200, we continue to demonstrate our ability to provide our customers with innovative solutions,"" said Raj Shanmugaraj, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acacia Communications. ""We believe that our AC1200 reduces the need for costly regeneration in long-haul networks, can adapt signal bandwidth to ROADM based metro networks and leverages 600 Gbps transmission to lower cost per bit in DCI networks."" Acacia's AC1200 module supports security encryption and a wide range of host interfaces designed to reduce or eliminate the need for costly external devices. The module features a software control interface that streamlines the integration and allows customers to more quickly take advantage of this highly flexible solution. Acacia recently shipped its first customer samples and anticipates production to begin in the second half of 2018. The high capacity, enhanced performance, and rich feature set help to position Acacia's AC1200 to enable carriers and content providers to meet their growing bandwidth demands.

Viasat began shipping equipment to Brazil in February 2018, and initial service is expected to begin in April 2018. Benefits of the Deal The collaboration will help fulfill the Brazilian Government's National Broadband Program, which is focused on promoting social and economic development in the country by ensuring fast, affordable broadband connectivity to all Brazilians. As per the agreement, Telebras will combine its Ka-band capacity on the Geostationary Satellite for Defense and Strategic Communications, SGDC-1, with Viasat's proven ground network and infrastructure, to enable the commercial viability of the SGDC-1 satellite and begin connecting the unconnected across the country. Once the SGDC-1 network is operational, Telebras can provide internet services to Brazil's citizens under the ""Brazilian Internet For All"" public policy, as well as key national government entities, including schools, hospitals, and other government institutions under the Brazilian e-government initiative known as Governo Electronico - Serviço de Atendimento ao Cidadão (GESAC). Viasat will leverage the SGDC-1 satellite network to explore satellite services for enterprise and commercial aviation markets, and launch satellite-enabled Wi-Fi hotspot and residential services into communities across Brazil that lack high-quality, affordable internet services. The Company has deep domain knowledge and expertise in bringing cost-effective satellite-enabled communications and Wi-Fi hotspot services to unconnected communities across North America. SGDC is a large satellite carrying seven X-band transponders for the Brazilian Ministry of Defense and 50 Ka-band transponders for Telebras to connect unreached and underserved regions of the country. European launch provider, Arianespace, launched the satellite in May 2017.

Martinhão added that, together with Viasat, Telebras can help meet its mission in public policies, which is to bring affordable internet to all, while building Brazil's competitive global future through job creation and skillset development, and by reducing the socio-economic disparities created by a lack of internet access across the region.

ACIA,"MAYNARD, Mass., Feb 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Acacia Communications, Inc. ACIA, +3.22% a leading provider of high-speed coherent optical interconnect products, today reported financial results for its fourth quarter and full year ended December 31, 2017. ""While we continue to face some headwinds in the market, our fourth quarter 2017 results were in-line with our expectations,"" said Raj Shanmugaraj, President and Chief Executive Officer of Acacia Communications. ""Our team at Acacia continued to execute well on new product introductions and on our ongoing customer diversification efforts. We are pleased with our product roadmap and believe we are well positioned to take advantage of market opportunities as conditions improve."" ""In the fourth quarter of 2017, we were able to increase our gross margins and cash balance on a quarter over quarter basis -- demonstrating the strength of our leveraged business model,"" said John Gavin, Chief Financial Officer of Acacia Communications. ""While we are projecting first quarter 2018 revenue to be down sequentially, like others in our industry, we see signs of improving market conditions in 2018, although we continue to remain cautious."" Results for the Fourth Quarter of 2017 Revenue of $86.6 million, decreased 39.2% year-over-year GAAP gross margin of 46.2%; non-GAAP gross margin* of 44.5% GAAP income from operations of $4.9 million; non-GAAP income from operations* of $9.2 million GAAP net loss of $20.4 million; non-GAAP net income* of $11.1 million EBITDA* of $8.0 million; adjusted EBITDA* of $12.3 million GAAP diluted loss per share of $0.52; non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $0.27 Results for the Full Year 2017 Revenue of $385.2 million, decreased 19.5% year-over-year GAAP gross margin of 43.6%; non-GAAP gross margin* of 45.4% GAAP income from operations of $37.1 million; non-GAAP income from operations* of $65.5 million GAAP net income of $38.5 million; non-GAAP net income* of $73.1 million EBITDA* of $49.2 million; adjusted EBITDA* of $77.7 million GAAP diluted EPS of $0.92; non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $1.75 Outlook for the First Quarter of 2018 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this press release. Acacia Communications disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Acacia Communications' guidance for its first quarter ending March 31, 2018 is: Quarter Ending March 31, 2018             Revenue (millions)   $67.0   to   $74.0 Non-GAAP Net Income* (millions)   $0.3   to   $4.3 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS*   $0.01   to   $0.10 *Non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Please refer below to Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information for descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and to the Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures, attached as Schedule D, for reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to these non-GAAP financial measures. Acacia Communications has not reconciled the above first quarter 2018 guidance for GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS, respectively, because the expected tax benefits derived from any employee equity awards during the first quarter of 2018 cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. Accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Acacia Communications will host a conference call to discuss its results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017, recent developments and the Company's business outlook and strategy at 5 p.m. Eastern Time today. The live webcast of the call, along with the Company's earnings press release, can be accessed at the Acacia Communications' Investor Relations website at http://ir.acacia-inc.com. The U.S. dial-in for the call is 1-877-407-8293 (1-201-689-8349 for non-U.S. callers). Please ask to be joined to the Acacia Communications call. A replay of the conference call will be available until March 8, 2018, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time, while an archived version of the webcast will be available on the Acacia Communications' Investor Relations website for 90 days. The U.S. dial-in for the conference call replay is 1-877-660-6853 (1-201-612-7415 for non-U.S. callers). The replay access code is 13675242. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. Schedule D of this press release provides reconciliations of Acacia Communications' most comparable GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Acacia Communications believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors, in addition to providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures, provides investors the benefit of viewing the Company's performance using the same financial metrics that its management team uses in making many key decisions and evaluating how its results of operations may look in the future. Acacia Communications' management does not believe that items not involving cash expenditures, such as non-cash compensation related to equity awards and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability changes derived from mark-to-market adjustments, are part of its critical decision making process. Also, Acacia Communications' management does not believe that warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue are reflective of the Company's underlying operating performance. Additionally, Acacia Communications' management believes the impacts of the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Act""), including the revaluation of its deferred tax assets and liabilities and the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings, is a unique event that limits comparability with prior periods and does not accurately reflect the underlying performance of its continuing business operations for the period in which they were incurred. Therefore, Acacia Communications excludes those items, as applicable, from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Acacia Communications' non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the metrics described below, as well as the related income tax effects. The income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments is determined by recalculating income tax expense excluding these adjustments. Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit as reported on its consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash charge, and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP gross margin as the non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue as reported on its consolidated income statements. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP research and development expenses. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP research and development expenses as research and development expenses as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP research and development expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses as sales, general and administrative expenses as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP operating expenses. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP operating expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP income from operations. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP income from operations as income from operations as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP income from operations because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP net income as net income (loss) as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and the change in fair value of the Company's preferred stock warrant liability, both of which are non-cash charges, as well as warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, and the tax effects of those excluded items. Additionally, the impacts of the Act have been excluded as it is a unique event that limits comparability with prior periods and does not accurately reflect the underlying performance of the Company's continuing business operations for the period in which they were incurred. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP effective tax rate as the non-GAAP (benefit) provision for income taxes divided by non-GAAP income before (benefit) provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP (benefit) provision for income taxes is defined as the provision (benefit) for income taxes as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, as adjusted for the tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of the Company's preferred stock warrant liability and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, as well as the impact of the Act. Non-GAAP income before (benefit) provision for income taxes is defined as GAAP income before provision (benefit) for income taxes, excluding stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of the Company's preferred stock warrant liability and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. In order to calculate non-GAAP diluted EPS, Acacia Communications uses a non-GAAP weighted-average share count. The Company defines non-GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute non-GAAP diluted EPS as GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute diluted earnings (loss) per share, adjusted to reflect the conversion of its redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock and the conversion of its redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants into common stock warrants, both as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. For periods in which there was a GAAP net loss resulting in GAAP diluted net loss per share, the impact of dilutive stock-based awards was added to the GAAP weighted-average share count to calculate the GAAP diluted earnings per share. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS because the Company believes that the exclusion of the items discussed above facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry and more accurately reflects the underlying performance of our continuing business operations. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Acacia Communications defines EBITDA as net income (loss) as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements before depreciation, interest income, net, and its provision (benefit) for income taxes. Acacia Communications defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, the change in fair value of the Company's preferred stock warrant liability and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Acacia Communications has presented adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by its management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the Company's operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing its business. In particular, Acacia Communications believes that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of its core operating performance. Acacia Communications uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and trends, and make planning decisions. Acacia Communications believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures helps identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the items that the Company excludes. Accordingly, Acacia Communications believes that these financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making. Acacia Communications' non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures rather than gross profit, gross margin, research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, income from operations, net income (loss), effective tax rate or diluted EPS, which are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations are: Acacia Communications excludes stock-based compensation expense from each of its non-GAAP financial measures, although it has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for its business and an important part of the Company's compensation strategy;  Acacia Communications excludes the tax benefits generated from the exercise of non-qualified stock options, the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and ESPP shares, and the vesting of restricted stock units, including any excess tax benefits and shortfalls recognized by the Company in the year of the taxable transaction, in calculating its non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS. The Company believes that excluding these tax benefits enables investors to see the full effect that excluding stock-based compensation expense had on the operating results. These benefits are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying employee equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of exercise or vesting, which factors may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of the Company's business. Similar to stock-based compensation expense, the Company believes that excluding these tax benefits provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of its business operations and facilitates comparison with other periods as well as the results of other companies in its industry;  Acacia Communications excludes the change in fair value of its preferred stock warrant liability from its non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures, as it has historically been a recurring non-cash charge but it has not recurred in the periods following the Company's initial public offering;  Acacia Communications excludes warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue from its non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures, as management does not believe the charges are reflective of the Company's underlying operating performance;  Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS do not reflect the impact of the Act, part of which is federal taxes incurred on the repatriation of accumulated foreign earnings which will be paid over an eight-year period;  EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA exclude depreciation expense and, although this is a non-cash expense, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future;  EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest income, which increases cash available to the Company, as this income is not generated by the Company's core operations;  EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the provision (benefit) for income tax which may impact cash available to the Company; and  the expenses and other items that the Company excludes in its calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. Because of these limitations, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Acacia Communications' use of non-GAAP financial measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that Acacia Communications will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. Investors should consider Acacia Communications' non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.

ACIA,"MAYNARD, Mass., Dec 11, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Acacia Communications ACIA, +3.22% a leading provider of high-speed coherent optical interconnect products, today announced the general availability of its pluggable coherent CFP2-DCO module supporting 100 Gbps and 200 Gbps transmission. Acacia designed this module to help cloud and telecommunications providers reduce operational and capital expenses, increase reach and accelerate time-to-market of high-capacity solutions. Acacia Communications' CFP2-DCO coherent pluggable modules are suitable for a wide range of network applications, including data center interconnect, metro access, metro core, long-haul, as well as emerging applications including remote PHY and client optical interfaces up to 80 km. These CFP2-DCO modules help to simplify network management and reduce operations costs for providers by enabling an Acacia-based eco-system through its network equipment partners. Acacia believes that these compact pluggable modules will allow its customers to offer some of the lowest power solutions available in the optical transport industry. The CFP2-DCO form factor offers many advantages compared to alternative coherent architectures, including: Pay-as-you-grow deployment model - Defers the deployment cost, including that of the digital signal processor (DSP), of additional ports until additional bandwidth is needed. Digital host interface - Streamlines integration into existing network equipment and supports field plugability without the need for complex calibration. The use of pluggable optics means that a failure in a single module will affect only the module's port, not the entire line card. Flexible modulation - 100 Gbps transmission using QPSK modulation for metro-core and long haul applications and 200 Gbps for metro-access applications using either 16QAM for backward compatibility or 8QAM for greater reach and fewer regeneration stages. ""Acacia's CFP2-DCO can address a wide range of networking applications in a compact form factor,"" said Benny Mikkelsen, Founder and Chief Technology Officer of Acacia Communications. ""Our team has done a great job to develop this low power solution, while maintaining high performance. With the Optical Internetworking Forum (OIF) developing a CFP2-DCO Implementation Agreement, the form factor is positioned for wide adoption in the optical networking industry and with support for up to 400 Gbps, the CFP2-DCO form factor can offer network operators a long term return on investment."" ""The Acacia 200 Gbps CFP2-DCO is the darling device of 2H17. It is unrivaled in performance and power consumption,"" said founder and lead analyst Andrew Schmitt, Cignal AI. Initially sampled in 2016, Acacia Communications' award-winning CFP2-DCO supports four times the faceplate density of the CFP-DCO. Acacia's CFP2-DCO incorporates its Meru DSP ASIC, based on 16nm CMOS technology, and its silicon photonic integrated circuit. Internal layer 1 encryption can be enabled for enhanced security applications.

ACIA,"SANTA CLARA, Calif., Nov 08, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- TIP Summit -- Edgecore Networks®, the leader in open networking, today announced its contribution to the Telecom Infra Project (TIP) of the hardware design for the “Cassini” packet transponder, the industry’s highest capacity and first modular open-source whitebox packet transponder offering a flexible mix of 100 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) packet switching ports and 100/200 Gbps coherent optical interfaces for data center interconnect and service provider backhaul use cases. Cassini was developed by Edgecore Networks with leading optical companies— NTT Electronics, Acacia Communications, and Finisar Corporation— and will support disaggregated software options including IP Infusion OcNOS™ and open source alternatives. “The Open Optical Packet Transport project group in TIP pioneered the whitebox packet transponder concept with its introduction last year of the Voyager design which has gained significant interest in the community and from network operators,” said George Tchaparian, CEO, Edgecore Networks. “We have long supported open whitebox hardware with our many switch, PON OLT, and WiFi design contributions to the Open Compute Project®, and are now pleased to contribute the Cassini design to TIP as an open platform to provide more flexible whitebox choices to operators and encourage further collaboration between the packet switching and optical technology worlds.” Demonstrating the benefits of collaborative development on open platforms, NTT Electronics worked with Edgecore Networks to develop an ACO line card for the Cassini platform. The ACO line card incorporates NTT Electronics’ ExaSPEED 200 DSP enabling high performance coherent optical connections over metro and long-haul distances. As an open network platform, Cassini will support disaggregated software options including OcNOS from IP Infusion, a leading whitebox switching NOS optimized for service provider and data center interconnect use cases. For SDN controller-based deployments, Edgecore provides open source software for its whitebox leaf/spine switches and PON OLT products, and now for the Cassini packet transponder, to enable those disaggregated hardware products to be managed through the ONOS® SDN controller and associated applications, for example, in CORD infrastructures. “ IP Infusion sees the benefits to our data center and service provider customers of extending the open network, disaggregated model to the integration of packet switching and optical transport technology,” said Atsushi Ogata, CEO, IP Infusion. “Our OcNOS already supports a rich set of switching and routing features, and its availability on Edgecore’s Cassini packet optical transponder will help network operators easily extend and migrate existing metro and long-haul Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) networks to add new 100G capacities, and extend inter-DC L2 and L3 services.” The Cassini packet transponder is a 1.5RU form factor with system throughput of 3.2Tbps based on Broadcom StrataXGS™ Tomahawk™ Plus switch silicon.

""Sales to our newer customer group, outside our original eight customers, accounted for 31% of our total revenues in the third quarter and, among the four customers that each contributed greater than 10% of our revenues this quarter, was the direct hyper-scale customer that had been a 10% total revenue contributor in the fourth quarter of 2016. We are continuing to add new products to our strong portfolio of coherent optical interconnect solutions, such as our industry first CFP2-DCO and recently announced 1.2 Tbps AC1200 module."" ""Third quarter revenue was in the upper end of our guidance range, and non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS came in above our guidance range,"" said John Gavin, Chief Financial Officer of Acacia Communications. ""These results were driven by a combination of continued global demand for our CFP and flex-400G products in the third quarter, as well as recovery of shipments that were delayed in the second quarter as a result of the previously announced quality issue."" Results for the Third Quarter of 2017 Revenue of $105.0 million, decreased 22% year-over-year GAAP gross margin of 43.9%; non-GAAP gross margin* of 43.7% GAAP income from operations of $8.9 million; non-GAAP income from operations* of $14.6 million GAAP net income of $18.5 million; non-GAAP net income* of $19.1 million EBITDA* of $12.1 million; adjusted EBITDA* of $17.8 million GAAP diluted EPS of $0.44; non-GAAP diluted EPS* of $0.46 Outlook for the Fourth Quarter of 2017 The following statements are based on current expectations. These statements are forward-looking and actual results may differ materially, as a result of, among other things, the important factors discussed at the end of this press release. Acacia Communications disclaims any obligation to update these forward-looking statements. Acacia Communications' guidance for its fourth quarter ending December 31, 2017 is:   Quarter Ending December 31, 2017 Revenue (millions) $83.0   to $93.0 Non-GAAP Net Income* (millions) $8.0   to $15.0 Non-GAAP Diluted EPS* $0.19   to $0.36   *Non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS are non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Please refer below to Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information for descriptions of these non-GAAP financial measures and to the Reconciliation of GAAP Measures to Non-GAAP Measures, attached as Schedule D, for reconciliations of the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures to these non-GAAP financial measures. Acacia Communications has not reconciled the above fourth quarter 2017 guidance for GAAP net income and GAAP diluted EPS to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted EPS, respectively, because the expected tax benefits derived from any employee equity awards during the fourth quarter of 2017 cannot be reasonably calculated or predicted at this time. Accordingly, a reconciliation is not available without unreasonable effort. Conference Call Acacia Communications will host a conference call to discuss its results for the third quarter of 2017, recent developments and the Company's business outlook and strategy at 5 p.m. Eastern Time today.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Information This press release includes non-GAAP financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with, nor an alternative to, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures are not based on any standardized methodology prescribed by GAAP and are not necessarily comparable to similarly-titled measures presented by other companies. Schedule D of this press release provides reconciliations of Acacia Communications' most comparable GAAP financial measures to non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Acacia Communications believes that providing these non-GAAP financial measures to investors, in addition to providing the most directly comparable GAAP measures, provides investors the benefit of viewing the Company's performance using the same financial metrics that its management team uses in making many key decisions and evaluating how its results of operations may look in the future. Acacia Communications' management does not believe that items not involving cash expenditures, such as non-cash compensation related to equity awards and redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant liability changes derived from mark-to-market adjustments, are part of its critical decision making process. Also, Acacia Communications' management does not believe that warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue are reflective of the Company's underlying operating performance. Therefore, Acacia Communications excludes those items, as applicable, from non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP research and development expenses, non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses, non-GAAP operating expenses, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA. Acacia Communications' non-GAAP financial measures reflect adjustments based on the metrics described below, as well as the related income tax effects. The income tax effect of these non-GAAP adjustments is determined by recalculating income tax expense excluding these adjustments. Non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP gross profit as gross profit as reported on its consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, which is a non-cash charge, and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP gross margin as the non-GAAP gross profit divided by revenue as reported on its consolidated income statements. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP gross profit and gross margin because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation and the quality issue warranty and other charges facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP research and development expenses. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP research and development expenses as research and development expenses as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP research and development expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses as sales, general and administrative expenses as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP sales, general and administrative expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP operating expenses. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP operating expenses as operating expenses as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP operating expenses because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP income from operations. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP income from operations as income (loss) from operations as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP income from operations because the Company believes that the exclusion of stock-based compensation and the quality issue warranty and other charges facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. Non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP net income as net income as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, excluding the impact of stock-based compensation and the change in fair value of the Company's preferred stock warrant liability, both of which are non-cash charges, as well as warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue, and the tax effects of those excluded items. Acacia Communications defines non-GAAP effective tax rate as the non-GAAP (benefit) provision for income taxes divided by non-GAAP income before (benefit) provision for income taxes. Non-GAAP (benefit) provision for income taxes is defined as the (benefit) provision for income taxes as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements, as adjusted for the tax effects of excluding stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of the Company's preferred stock warrant liability and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Non-GAAP income before (benefit) provision for income taxes is defined as GAAP income before (benefit) provision for income taxes, excluding stock-based compensation expense, the change in fair value of the Company's preferred stock warrant liability and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. In order to calculate non-GAAP diluted EPS, Acacia Communications uses a non-GAAP weighted-average share count. The Company defines non-GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute non-GAAP diluted EPS as GAAP weighted-average shares used to compute diluted earnings per share, adjusted to reflect the conversion of its redeemable convertible preferred stock into common stock and the conversion of its redeemable convertible preferred stock warrants into common stock warrants, both as if they had occurred at the beginning of the period. Acacia Communications has presented non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate and non-GAAP diluted EPS because the Company believes that the exclusion of the items discussed above facilitates comparisons of its results of operations to other companies in its industry. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA. Acacia Communications defines EBITDA as net income as reported on the Company's consolidated income statements before depreciation, interest income, net, and its (benefit) provision for income taxes. Acacia Communications defines adjusted EBITDA as EBITDA excluding the impact of stock-based compensation, the change in fair value of the Company's preferred stock warrant liability and warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue. Acacia Communications has presented adjusted EBITDA because it is a key measure used by its management and board of directors to understand and evaluate the Company's operating performance, to establish budgets and to develop operational goals for managing its business. In particular, Acacia Communications believes that the exclusion of the amounts eliminated in calculating adjusted EBITDA can provide a useful measure for period-to-period comparisons of its core operating performance. Acacia Communications uses these non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate its operating performance and trends, and make planning decisions. Acacia Communications believes that each of these non-GAAP financial measures helps identify underlying trends in its business that could otherwise be masked by the effect of the items that the Company excludes. Accordingly, Acacia Communications believes that these financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding and evaluating its operating results, enhancing the overall understanding of the Company's past performance and future prospects, and allowing for greater transparency with respect to key financial metrics used by its management in its financial and operational decision-making. Acacia Communications' non-GAAP financial measures are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, and should not be considered in isolation of, or as an alternative to, measures prepared in accordance with GAAP. There are a number of limitations related to the use of these non-GAAP financial measures rather than gross profit, gross margin, research and development expenses, sales, general and administrative expenses, operating expenses, income (loss) from operations, net income, effective tax rate or diluted EPS, which are the most directly comparable GAAP measures. Some of these limitations are: Acacia Communications excludes stock-based compensation expense from each of its non-GAAP financial measures, as it has recently been, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future, a significant recurring expense for its business and an important part of the Company's compensation strategy; Acacia Communications excludes the tax benefits generated from the exercise of non-qualified stock options, the disqualifying disposition of incentive stock options and ESPP shares, and the vesting of restricted stock units, including any excess tax benefits and shortfalls recognized by the Company in the year of the taxable transaction, in calculating its non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP net income, and non-GAAP diluted EPS. Without excluding these tax benefits, investors would not see the full effect that excluding stock-based compensation expense had on our operating results. These benefits are tied to the exercise or vesting of underlying employee equity awards and the price of our common stock at the time of exercise or vesting, which factors may vary from period to period independent of the operating performance of our business. Similar to stock-based compensation expense, we believe that excluding these tax benefits provides investors and management with greater visibility to the underlying performance of our business operations and facilitates comparison with other periods as well as the results of other companies in our industry; Acacia Communications excludes the change in fair value of its preferred stock warrant liability from its non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures, as it has historically been a recurring non-cash charge but it will not recur in the periods following the Company's initial public offering; Acacia Communications excludes warranty and other charges arising from a manufacturing process quality issue from its non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross margin, non-GAAP income from operations, non-GAAP net income, non-GAAP effective tax rate, non-GAAP diluted EPS and adjusted EBITDA measures, as management does not believe the charges are reflective of the Company's underlying operating performance; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA exclude depreciation expense and, although this is a non-cash expense, the assets being depreciated may have to be replaced in the future; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect interest income, which increases cash available to the Company, as this income is not generated by our core operations; EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA do not reflect the (benefit) provision for income tax which may impact cash available to the Company; and the expenses and other items that the Company excludes in its calculation of adjusted EBITDA may differ from the expenses and other items, if any, that other companies may exclude from adjusted EBITDA when they report their operating results. Because of these limitations, non-GAAP financial measures should be considered along with other operating and financial performance measures presented in accordance with GAAP. Acacia Communications' use of non-GAAP financial measures, and the underlying methodology when excluding certain items, is not necessarily an indication of the results of operations that may be expected in the future, or that Acacia Communications will not, in fact, record such items in future periods. Investors should consider Acacia Communications' non-GAAP financial measures in conjunction with the corresponding GAAP financial measures.
