ABLX,"Sanofi SA (SAN.FR) said Thursday that it has received antitrust clearances in the U.S. and Germany in connection with its proposed acquisition of Ablynx NV (ABLX.BT). Sanofi said that a waiting period for its proposed acquisition of Ablynx has expired without objections being raised. Under the U.S. Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act, parties to certain transactions must submit notification to the country's Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice and wait before the transaction can be completed. The proposed acquisition has also been cleared by the Federal Cartel Office of Germany, the FCO, the French pharmaceutical company said. With the expiration of the waiting period and the FCO clearance, ""the condition to the offers relating to antitrust approvals has been satisfied,"" Sanofi said. In late January, Sanofi agreed to buy Belgian biopharmaceutical company Ablynx for 3.9 billion euros ($4.76 billion). The closing of the offers is still subject to various conditions, Sanofi said.","Mar 1, 2018 5:00 a.m. ET",1,"Sanofi gets U.S., German nods for Ablynx deal",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sanofi-gets-us-german-nods-for-ablynx-deal-2018-03-01
ABLX,"Denmark's Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVO-B.KO) said Monday it won't come back with a revised bid for Ablynx NV ABLX, +1.30% after the Belgian biopharmaceutical company agreed a takeover deal from Sanofi SA (SAN.FR). Novo Nordisk had been courting Ablynx for the last couple of months, but said recently that the Ablynx board had rejected two of its bids and declined to engage in any discussions. Novo Nordisk's latest offer, made Dec. 22, 2017, was a 2.6 billion-euro ($3.2 billion) bid consisting of EUR28.00 upfront and EUR2.50 in Contingent Value Rights. Ablynx accepted a EUR3.9 billion offer from Sanofi on Monday, saying the French drug maker's bid ""represents compelling value for shareholders and maximizes the potential of our pipeline."" In response, Novo Nordisk confirmed it would not be making a revised proposal.

ABLX,"PARIS -- Sanofi SA said Monday it would buy Belgian biotech Ablynx NV for EUR3.9 billion ($4.85 billion), the French drugmaker's second acquisition this month after purchasing U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ Inc. Sanofi will pay EUR45 a share for Ablynx, which earlier this month rejected a EUR2.6 billion offer from Denmark's Novo Nordisk A/S. Novo Nordisk said Monday it won't be making a revised proposal. The French company has been under pressure from investors to complete a large acquisition after it lost out to Pfizer Inc. in a bidding war for cancer-drug maker Medivation in 2016 and talks with Swiss biotech Actelion collapsed last year after the two firms failed to hash out an agreement. Johnson & Johnson agreed to take over Actelion for $30 billion last year. ""We can still do additional bolt on acquisitions,"" Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said on a call with reporters, adding that the company had a general target of EUR20 billion for acquisitions. The acquisition of Ablynx will bolster Sanofi's rare-blood disease drug portfolio, at a time when it is under pressure to launch new innovative medicines to make up for declining sales of its blockbuster Lantus insulin. Ablynx is developing a new class of drugs made from the unusually small antibodies produced by mammals in the camel family. It injects llamas with proteins carefully designed to stimulate an immune response with specific antibodies. These antibodies, which are around a 10th the size of human antibodies, can reach cells that otherwise would be inaccessible. Sanofi said the acquisition builds on an existing partnership and that the company intends to maintain and support the Ablynx science center in Ghent, Belgium. The transaction is expected to close by the end of the second quarter. Earlier this month, Sanofi agreed to buy hemophilia drugmaker Bioverativ for more than $11.5 billion, its biggest deal for seven years. Several analysts said the Bioverativ deal looked expensive, given uncertainties in the hemophilia market because of the launch of new treatments. Sanofi shares were flat at EUR73.48 on Monday in early trading.

ABLX,"European stocks on Monday closed at a 2½-year high partially buoyed by gains in German shares despite downbeat data from Europe’s largest economy. What are markets doing: The Stoxx Europe 600 index SXXP, +0.44%  tacked on 0.3% to end at 398.41, scoring its best close since July 2015, according to FactSet data. The gauge on Friday finished at its highest since August 2015, leading to last week's rise of 2.1%. Germany’s DAX 30 index DAX, +1.31%  rose 0.4% to finish at 13,367.78, holding near a two-month high. France’s CAC 40 PX1, +0.72%  picked up 0.3% to close at 5,487.42, also at its highest since early November. The U.K.’s FTSE 100 index UKX, +0.17% meanwhile, fell 0.4% to close at 7,696.51 after Friday’s record finish. The euro EURUSD, +0.1870%  slipped to $1.1979 from $1.2032 late Friday in New York. What’s driving the market: European stocks continued to march higher as the global equity rally hasn’t shown major signs of fatigue at the start of this year. “The opening strength tracks small gain in Asia, where markets were unperturbed by reports from China that the PBOC think “there is room for an increase in interest rates in the short term,” said Jasper Lawler, head of research at London Capital Group, in a note. PBOC refers to the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank. “With the macro backdrop looking supportive, focus is turning to earnings,” with Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan set to unofficially kick off earnings season on Friday, said Lawler. “Markets have been pricing in a short-term jolt to bank earnings from tax reform. A reduction in the value of deferred tax assets, essentially credits for old losses will hurt bank earnings in Q4.” See: Some European banks might suffer as a result of Republican tax plan German stocks advanced even as manufacturing orders unexpectedly fell 0.4% month-over-month in November. What strategists are saying: “Today’s drop in new orders should not ruin the current German growth party. In fact, the decrease comes after three consecutive increases and is rather of a technical nature than any sign of weakness. With inventories low and capacity utilization at its highest level since 2008, there is little reason to get concerned. The general trend for industrial production in Germany remains positive,” said Carsten Brzeski, ING’s chief economist covering Germany and Austria, in a note. “Having got off to such a positive start in 2018 and with economic data continuing to look reasonably resilient despite a fairly average U.S. jobs report [on Friday], investors continue to appear to be happy to push this bull market even higher, despite some misgivings that, particularly in the case of U.S. markets valuations remain stretched,” said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets UK, in a note.

ABLX,"Denmark's Novo Nordisk A/S (NOVO-B.KO) said Monday that Belgian biopharmaceutical company Ablynx NV ABLX, +1.30% has rejected its 2.6 billion-euro takeover bid and declined to engage in any discussions on the approach. The proposal represents a 66% premium over Ablynx's three-month volume-weighted average price of EUR18.39 as of Jan. 5, and comprises EUR28 in cash for each share plus one contingent value right with total potential cash payments over time of up to EUR2.50 a share. The proposal was made Dec. 22 and represented Novo Nordisk's second attempt after the EUR26.75 cash bid that it made Dec. 7. Both approaches have been rejected by the Ablynx board and Novo Nordisk said that it has made a number of attempts to engage in talks, but that these have also been spurned. Novo Nordisk Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen spoke to his counterpart at Ablynx, Edwin Moses, on Jan. 5 to encourage talks around key value drivers, but said that ""unfortunately, this offer was again refused by the Board of Directors of Ablynx."" Novo Nordisk is keen to conclude a deal, believing that Ablynx's caplacizumab drug to treat thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura--a rare blood disorder--would be a strong addition to its hematology franchise. ""The proposed transaction would combine Novo Nordisk's regulatory, scientific and commercial expertise with Ablynx's strong existing medical teams to optimise the development and global commercialisation of caplacizumab,"" the Danish company said in a statement. There can be no assurance that any agreement will be reached between the two companies, but Novo Nordisk said that it encourages Ablynx to engage in a negotiated transaction for the benefit of all stakeholders. It said that should any deal be struck, it would keep Ablynx's strong research-and-development base within Ghent, Belgium, and further develop Ablynx as a center of excellence in nanobody discovery and engineering. -Write to Dominic Chopping at dominic.chopping@wsj.com; Twitter: @domchopping @WSJNordics More from MarketWatch How to Get a Job: Advice From Extremely Successful People More Coverage Damn the torpedoes — what could take the S&P 500 to 3,000 Don’t ever do this with your credit card This emerging-market ETF continues to blow away the competition","Jan 8, 2018 2:02 a.m. ET",1,Ablynx rejects €2.6 bln Novo Nordisk bid,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/belgiums-ablynx-rejects-eur26b-novo-nordisk-bid-2018-01-08
