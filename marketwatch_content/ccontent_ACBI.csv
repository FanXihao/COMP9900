ACBI,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Management's discussion and analysis of earnings and related financial data is presented to assist in understanding the financial condition and results of operations of Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. and its subsidiaries. This discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. Although certain amounts for prior years have been reclassified to conform to statement presentations for 2017, the reclassifications have no material effect on shareholders' equity or net income as previously reported. Unless otherwise noted, for purposes of this section, ""Atlantic Capital"" refers to the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations for Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW AND EARNINGS SUMMARY On October 31, 2015, Atlantic Capital completed the acquisition of First Security and its wholly-owned bank subsidiary FSGBank. The acquired entity's results are included in Atlantic Capital's consolidated results beginning on October 31, 2015, the acquisition date. Atlantic Capital reported a net loss of $3.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. This compared to net income of $13.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. Diluted income per common share was ($0.15) for 2017, compared to $0.53 for 2016. The decrease in net income for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to 2016 was primarily the result of a $16.4 million, or 207%, increase in provision for income taxes. This was due to a reduction in the value of Atlantic Capital's net deferred tax asset as a result of the tax reform legislation signed into law on December 22, 2017. In addition, noninterest income decreased $5.5 million, or 26%, from 2016 to 2017, primarily due to the $3.9 million gain on the sale of seven branches in 2016 and a $1.4 million, or 94%, decrease in TriNet lending activities due to Atlantic Capital's decision to close the TriNet Lending division during the third quarter of 2016. This was offset by a $5.0 million, or 7%, increase in net interest income after provision for loan losses, resulting primarily from a $4.1 million, or 5%, increase in interest and fee income on loans, and a $3.5 million, or 61%, increase in interest on investment securities available-for-sale. Atlantic Capital reported net income of $13.4 million, or $0.53 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2016 compared to a net loss of $1.3 million, or ($0.09) per diluted common share for the year ended December 31, 2015. The $14.7 million increase in net income from 2015 to 2016 was primarily the result of a $32.7 million, or 74%, increase in net interest income before provision for loan losses, as well as a $4.2 million, or 53%, decrease in the provision for loan losses. During the fourth quarter of 2015, Atlantic Capital recorded a loan loss provision related to the acquired First Security loan portfolio in the amount of $6.8 million. In addition, noninterest income increased $12.3 million, or 131%, from 2015 to 2016, due to the $3.9 million gain on the sale of seven branches, increased service charges and higher trust and mortgage income due to the acquisition of First Security. This was offset by a $27.3 million, or 60%, increase in noninterest expense, resulting primarily from a $24.1 million increase in salary and benefits, occupancy, equipment and software, and data processing expenses related to the acquisition of First Security. Taxable equivalent net interest income was $82.0 million for 2017, compared to $77.2 million for 2016. Taxable equivalent net interest margin increased to 3.28% for the year ended December 31, 2017, from 3.12% for 2016. The margin increase was primarily due to increases in the Fed Funds rate. Taxable equivalent net interest income increased $33.1 million, or 75%, from $44.1 million for 2015, to $77.2 million for 2016. Net interest margin increased from 2.99% for the year ended December 31, 2015 to 3.12% for 2016. The margin increase was primarily due to higher yields on loans and the increase in loan volume from First Security. Provision for loan losses for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $3.2 million, a decrease of $598,000 from the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily related to a reduction in loan growth. Provision expense decreased by $4.2 million from $8.0 million in 2015 to $3.8 million in 2016. The decrease was primarily due to a $6.8 million provision recorded in the fourth quarter of 2015 related to the acquired First Security loan portfolio. Noninterest income decreased $5.5 million, or 26%, to $16.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 from the year ended December 31, 2016. The decrease was primarily due to the $3.9 million gain on the sale of seven branches in 2016, and a $1.4 million, or 94%, decrease in TriNet lending activities due to Atlantic Capital's decision to close the TriNet Lending division during the third quarter of 2016.  Noninterest income increased by $12.3 million, or 131%, from $9.4 million in 2015 to $21.7 million in 2016. The increase was primarily due to a $2.9 million increase in service charges due to the addition of First Security deposits, the $3.9 million gain on the sale of seven branches, as well as $1.5 million in gains related to the sale of TriNet loans. Two new lines of business resulting from the merger - mortgage banking and trust - contributed an additional $1.8 million and $1.2 million, respectively, during 2016, compared to 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2017, noninterest expense increased $185,000, or less than 1%, compared to the same period of 2016. Salary and benefits expense increased $3.1 million, or 7%, in 2017 due to severance costs and $2.0 million in expenses related to the President and Chief Operating Officer's resignation. Additionally, professional services expense increased $1.8 million, or 63%, primarily due to expenses related to the public offering of common stock by a selling stockholder completed during the third quarter of 2017. These increases were offset by a $2.4 million, or 89%, decrease in merger and conversion costs from 2016 to 2017 related to the acquisition of First Security. Noninterest expense totaled $73.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to $45.9 million for 2015, an increase of $27.3 million, or 60%. The most significant components of the increase were higher salary and benefits, equipment and software, and data processing expenses related to the acquisition of First Security. access to liquidity and other factors. If the financial condition of borrowers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, Atlantic Capital's estimates would be updated and additions to the ALL may be required. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS a $4.1 million, or 5%, increase in interest income on loans, resulting from increases in the Fed Funds rate. Interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $15.1 million, a $3.6 million, or 31%, increase from 2016, primarily due to a $2.7 million, or 36%, increase in interest paid on deposits. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 24 basis points from 2016 to 2017, driven by an increase in interest rates on deposits and other borrowings resulting from increases in the Fed Funds rate. In addition, premium amortization on acquired time deposits reduced interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2017 in the amount of $352,000, compared to $853,000 for the year ended December 31, 2016. Taxable equivalent net interest margin increased to 3.28% from 3.12% for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the year ended December 31, 2016. The primary reasons for the increase in taxable equivalent net interest margin for 2017 compared to 2016 were the higher interest rates on loans resulting from Fed Funds rate increases. Net accretion income on acquired loans discount totaled $2.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $2.6 million for the same period in 2016. The following table presents information regarding average balances for assets and liabilities, the total dollar amounts of interest income and dividends from average interest-earning assets, the total dollar amounts of interest expense on average interest-bearing liabilities, and the resulting average yields and costs. The yields and costs for the periods indicated are derived by dividing the income or expense by the average balances for assets or liabilities, respectively, for the periods presented. Loan fees are included in interest income on loans.

Interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2017 totaled $4.1 million, a $1.1 million, or 38%, increase from the same period of 2016. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 30 basis points from the third quarter of 2016 to the third quarter of 2017, driven by an increase in interest rates on deposits and other borrowings. Average interest-bearing deposits were lower mainly due to the branch sale in the second quarter of 2017 and a reduction in brokered deposits. In addition, premium amortization of acquired time deposits reduced interest expense during the third quarter of 2017 in the amount of $75,000, compared to $170,000 in the third quarter of 2016. Taxable equivalent net interest income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 totaled $60.7 million, a $3.0 million, or 5%, increase compared to the same period in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by a $5.7 million, or 9%, increase in taxable equivalent interest income. The interest income increase primarily resulted from the following: a $2.4 million, or 4%, increase in interest income on loans, resulting from increases in the Fed Funds rate. Interest expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 totaled $11.1 million, a $2.6 million, or 31%, increase from the same period of 2016, primarily due to a $1.8 million, or 32%, increase in interest paid on deposits. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 23 basis points from the first nine months of 2016 to the same period of 2017, driven by an increase in interest rates on deposits and other borrowings. In addition, premium amortization of acquired time deposits reduced interest expense during the first nine months of 2017 in the amount of $280,000, as compared to $712,000 in the same period of 2016.

Interest expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $3.2 million, a $576,000, or 22%, increase from the same period of 2016. The rate paid on interest bearing liabilities increased 14 basis points from the first quarter of 2016 to the first quarter of 2017, driven by an increase in interest rates on deposits and other borrowings. Average interest-bearing deposits were lower mainly due to the branch sales in the second quarter of 2016. These deposits were replaced in part by higher cost short term borrowings. In addition, premium amortization of acquired time deposits reduced interest expense during the first quarter of 2017 in the amount of $119,000, compared to $142,000 in the first quarter of 2016. Interest expense on other borrowings increased $189,000, primarily due to a $95.1 million increase in the average balance. The rate paid on other borrowings also increased 10 basis points compared to the first quarter of 2016.

Income Statement Net interest income increased to $21.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 from $20.3 million in the third quarter of 2017, primarily as a result of higher loan and investment yields. Net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $686,000 in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $343,000 in the third quarter of 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.39% in the fourth quarter of 2017, an increase of 13 basis points from the third quarter of 2017.

Loan yields in the fourth quarter of 2017 increased 20 basis points to 4.61% from the third quarter of 2017 as a result of the December increase in the fed funds rate, an increase in loan fees and an increase in accretion income. Loan fees contributed 25 basis points to the loan yield in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to 20 basis points in the third quarter of 2017.

The increase included higher derivatives income of $97,000, and higher trust income of $45,000, resulting from an increase in assets under management. This was offset by a decrease in mortgage income of $30,000 due to lower residential mortgage loan sales and a decrease in SBA income of $45,000 resulting from lower loan sales. Noninterest expense totaled $20.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 compared to $17.5 million in the third quarter of 2017. Salaries and employee benefits expense increased by $2.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 to $13.3 million.

Loans held for investment were $1.93 billion at December 31, 2017, an increase of $28.4 million from September 30, 2017, as commercial and industrial loans grew $52.9 million during the quarter due to an increase in new loan originations and increased balances on existing loans. This increase was offset by a $27.7 million decrease in investment commercial real estate and construction and land loans related to the timing of payoffs. At December 31, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $19.3 million, or 1.00% of loans held for investment, compared to $18.9 million, or 0.99% of loans held for investment as of September 30, 2017.

Atlantic Capital management uses non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) operating net income; (ii) operating non-interest expense; (iii) operating non-interest income; (iv) taxable equivalent interest income; (v) taxable equivalent net interest margin; (vi) efficiency ratio; (vii) operating return on average assets; (viii) operating return on average equity; (ix) tangible common equity; and (x) tangible book value, in its analysis of the Company's performance. Operating net income excludes the following from net income available to common shareholders: merger and conversion costs, net gains on branch sales, and the income tax effect of adjustments. Operating net income also excludes the revaluation of net deferred tax assets. Operating non-interest expense excludes merger and conversion costs from non-interest expense as well as costs related to the sale of branches. The efficiency ratio excludes merger and conversion costs. Tangible common equity excludes goodwill and other intangible assets from shareholders' equity. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing performance and operations, and enhance comparability with prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as determined in accordance with GAAP, and investors should consider Atlantic Capital's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results or financial condition as reported under GAAP. Non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to non-GAAP financial measures presented by other companies.

ACBI,"ATLANTA, Oct 27, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. ACBI, -0.28% announced results of the quarter ended September 30, 2017. Third Quarter Highlights Reported net income of $4.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to $4.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2017. Reported return on average assets of 0.60% and tangible book value per share of $11.67. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting, reported taxable equivalent net interest margin of 3.20%, up 5 basis points from the second quarter of 2017. Lowered noninterest expense to $17.5 million from $17.6 million in the second quarter of 2017. Decreased nonperforming assets to 0.23% of total assets from 0.52% in the second quarter of 2017. ""Atlantic Capital's earnings this quarter fell short of our expectations for a variety of reasons, including exceptionally large, unanticipated loan repayments and one time expenses related to the secondary offering in August. Our board and new leadership team are working together to develop and implement new revenue and cost savings initiatives designed to accelerate performance improvement in 2018 and beyond,"" explained Douglas Williams, Chief Executive Officer. Results of Operations For the third quarter of 2017, Atlantic Capital recorded net income of $4.1 million, or $0.16 per diluted share, compared to net income of $4.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, in the second quarter of 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest income decreased to $20.5 million in the third quarter of 2017 from $20.7 million in the second quarter of 2017. This decrease was driven by lower loan accretion income and an increase in the cost of interest bearing deposits. Net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $343,000 in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $629,000 in the second quarter of 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.26% in the third quarter of 2017, unchanged from the second quarter of 2017. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting, the margin in the third quarter of 2017 increased 5 basis points to 3.20%, benefiting from the increase in the Fed Funds rate in June 2017. Loan yields, excluding loan accretion income, increased 10 basis points and the cost of deposits increased 4 basis points in the third quarter. The accretion of the acquired loan discount and amortization of time deposit premium contributed 6 basis points to the net interest margin in the third quarter of 2017 compared to 11 basis points in the second quarter of 2017. The provision for loan losses was $322,000 in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter of 2017 included the downgrade of a $7.7 million loan relationship to nonperforming and an additional $1.0 million specific reserve related to this downgrade. The third quarter included a $3.3 million charge-off of this loan relationship which had a $2.75 million total specific reserve as of June 30, 2017. Noninterest income totaled $3.5 million in the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of $1.8 million from the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter of 2017 included a $302,000 gain on the sale of the Cleveland branch, a $240,000 gain on sale of other real estate, and a $426,000 gain on the sale of a tax credit investment. In addition, SBA lending activities decreased $283,000 from the second quarter of 2017, to $888,000. Noninterest expense totaled $17.5 million in the third quarter of 2017 compared to $17.6 million in the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter of 2017 included $304,000 in merger expenses related to rebranding of the legacy First Security branches. The third quarter of 2017 included $395,000 in expenses related to the public offering of common stock by a selling stockholder completed during the quarter. Salaries and employee benefits decreased in the third quarter of 2017 by $194,000 to $10.4 million mainly from a lower incentive accrual. Total loans were $1.91 billion at September 30, 2017, a decrease of $55.1 million from June 30, 2017. Loans held for investment were $1.91 billion at September 30, 2017, a decrease of $56.7 million from June 30, 2017 mainly as a result of higher loan payoffs and decreases in the balances of existing lines of credit. Mortgage warehouse participations decreased $6.4 million in the third quarter to $41.6 million at September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $18.9 million, or 0.99% of loans held for investment, compared to $21.9 million, or 1.11% of loans held for investment as of June 30, 2017. The decrease in the allowance was the result of the $3.3 million charge-off of the $7.7 million loan relationship which had a $2.75 million specific impairment as of June 30, 2017. Annualized net charge-offs to average loans totaled 0.68% in the third quarter of 2017 and totaled 0.32% the first nine months of 2017. Nonperforming assets totaled $6.0 million, or 0.23% of total assets, as of September 30, 2017, compared to $14.1 million, or 0.52% of total assets, as of June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of the $3.3 million charge-off of the $7.7 million loan relationship. Total average deposits for the third quarter of 2017 were $2.12 billion, a decrease of $37.4 million from the second quarter of 2017. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased $1.7 million to $628 million in the third quarter of 2017 and accounted for 29.6% of average total deposits. Average deposits associated with our payments business were $210 million in the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of $34.3 million from the second quarter of 2017.

ACBI,"ATLANTA, Jul 28, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Atlantic Capital Bancshares, Inc. ACBI, -0.28% (""Atlantic Capital"") announced results of the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Second Quarter Highlights Reported net income of $4.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to $3.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Reported return on average assets of 0.63% and tangible book value per share of $11.47. Increased taxable equivalent net interest margin to 3.26% from 3.20% in the first quarter of 2017. Lowered efficiency ratio to 68.4% from 76.8% in the first quarter of 2017. Increased loans held for investment $60.4 million, or 12.7% annualized, to $1.96 billion from March 31, 2017. Increased average quarterly deposits $47 million, or 8.8% annualized, to $2.16 billion from the first quarter of 2017. ""Atlantic Capital reported improved results for the second quarter of 2017 reflecting strong loan growth, net interest margin expansion, higher non-interest income, and good expense control,"" explained Douglas Williams, Chief Executive Officer. Results of Operations For the second quarter of 2017, Atlantic Capital recorded net income of $4.3 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.2 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, in the first quarter of 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest income improved to $20.7 million in the second quarter of 2017 from $19.5 million the first quarter of 2017. This increase was driven largely by an increase in interest-earning assets and the yield benefit from the Fed Funds rate increase in March 2017. Net accretion income on acquired loans totaled $629,000 and premium amortization on acquired time deposits totaled $86,000 in the second quarter of 2017 for total purchase accounting income of $715,000, a decrease of $106,000 compared to the first quarter of 2017. Taxable equivalent net interest margin was 3.26% in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 3.20% in the first quarter of 2017. The margin benefitted from the increase in the Fed Funds rate in March 2017. Loan yields increased 21 basis points to 4.37%, while cost of deposits increased 7 basis points to 0.46%. The accretion of the acquired loan discount and amortization of time deposit premium contributed 11 basis points to the net interest margin in the second quarter of 2017 compared to 13 basis points in the first quarter of 2017. The provision for loan losses was $2.0 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $634,000 in the first quarter of 2017. This increase was primarily related to the downgrade of a $7.7 million loan relationship to nonperforming and an additional $1.0 million specific reserve related to this downgrade. Noninterest income totaled $5.3 million in the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $1.4 million from the first quarter of 2017. This increase included a $302,000 gain on the sale of the Cleveland branch, a $240,000 gain on sale of other real estate, and a $426,000 gain on the sale of a tax credit investment. Noninterest expense totaled $17.6 million in the second quarter of 2017 compared to $17.7 million in the first quarter of 2017. The second quarter of 2017 included $304,000 in merger expenses related to the rebranding of the legacy First Security branches. Salaries and employee benefits decreased in the second quarter of 2017 by $462,000 to $10.6 million mainly from seasonally higher payroll taxes in the first quarter of 2017. Total loans were $1.96 billion at June 30, 2017, an increase of $32.9 million from March 31, 2017, after taking into account the sale of $27.9 million in branch loans held for sale in connection with the Cleveland branch sale. Loans held for investment were $1.96 billion at June 30, 2017, an increase of $60.4 million from March 31, 2017. Mortgage warehouse participations decreased $10.4 million in the second quarter to $48.0 million at June 30, 2017, primarily as a result of a reduction in loan participation commitments. Excluding the decrease in mortgage warehouse loans, loans held for investment increased $70.7 million, or 15.3% annualized, in the second quarter of 2017. At June 30, 2017, the allowance for loan losses was $21.9 million, or 1.11% of loans held for investment, compared to $19.9 million, or 1.05% of loans held for investment as of March 31, 2017. Annualized net charge-offs to average loans in the second quarter of 2017 totaled 0.01% and in the first six months of 2017 totaled 0.14%. Nonperforming assets totaled $14.1 million, or 0.52% of total assets, as of June 30, 2017, compared to $5.9 million, or 0.21% of total assets, as of March 31, 2017. Total average deposits for the second quarter of 2017 were $2.16 billion, an increase of $46.7 million, or 8.8% annualized, from the first quarter of 2017. Average noninterest bearing deposits increased $6.0 million to $626 million in the second quarter of 2017 and accounted for 29.0% of average total deposits, compared to $620 million, or 29.4%, of average total deposits for the first quarter of 2017. Average deposits associated with our payments business were $244 million in the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of $29.5 million from the first quarter of 2017. Earnings Conference Call Atlantic Capital will host a conference call at 10:00 a.m. EDT on Friday, July 28, 2017, to discuss the financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Statements included in this press release include non-GAAP financial measures and should be read along with the accompanying tables, which provide a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures. Atlantic Capital management uses non-GAAP financial measures, including: (i) operating net income; (ii) operating non-interest expense; (iii) operating non-interest income; (iv) taxable equivalent net interest income; (v) taxable equivalent net interest margin; (vi) efficiency ratio; (vii) operating return on average assets; (viii) operating return on average equity; (ix) tangible common equity; (x) deposits excluding deposits to be assumed in branch sales; (xi) loans held for investment excluding mortgage warehouse loans; and (xii) tangible book value per share, in its analysis of the Company's performance. Operating net income excludes the following from net income available to common shareholders: merger and conversion costs, net gains on branch sales, and the income tax effect of adjustments. Operating non-interest expense excludes merger and conversion costs from non-interest expense as well as costs related to the sale of branches. The efficiency ratio excludes merger and conversion costs. Tangible common equity and tangible book value exclude goodwill and core deposit intangible assets from shareholders' equity and total assets. Management believes that non-GAAP financial measures provide a greater understanding of ongoing performance and operations, and enhance comparability with prior periods. Non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to any measure of performance or financial condition as determined in accordance with GAAP, and investors should consider Atlantic Capital's performance and financial condition as reported under GAAP and all other relevant information when assessing the performance or financial condition of the Company. Non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools, and investors should not consider them in isolation or as a substitute for analysis of the results or financial condition as reported under GAAP.
