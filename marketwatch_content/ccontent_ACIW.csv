ACIW,"Chinese tourists will soon have an easier way of shopping in the U.S. Alipay announced this week it will be accepted by 35,000 additional merchants in the U.S. The Chinese mobile payment platform is an affiliate of mega-retailer Alibaba BABA, +2.59%  and owned by the financial services company Ant Financial. Those new merchants are in addition to the 4 million U.S. merchant locations that Alipay and First Data announced in May 2017. The expansion of Alipay, which already has over 600 million users, is possible through a partnership with Atlanta-based First Data FDC, +1.07% which facilitates the payments through its point-of-sale platforms. The reason for the integration? “Alipay aims to simplify every aspect of Chinese tourists’ travel in North America, enabling them to use Alipay for everything from ride-hailing and purchasing luxury goods, to making reservations at hotels and restaurants,” the company said in a statement. Currently, Alipay only works when linked with Chinese bank accounts. It works without the use of a credit card, making payments possible directly between bank accounts and retailers. Alipay isn’t the only company making shopping in the U.S. easier for those used to shopping in China. The payments company ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81%  on Wednesday announced a partnership with the Chinese company UnionPay International, which allows more UnionPay cards to be accepted at merchants worldwide. There are more than 7 billion UnionPay cards that have been issued worldwide. “If you’re a U.S. retailer, and you’re seeing the growth of Chinese tourism, there’s this opportunity to capture those tourist dollars coming into your store,” said Brendan Miller, a principal analyst at the research firm Forrester. Should antitrust laws be enforced against the tech giants' monopolies? Travel from China to the U.S. will likely only grow as more Chinese citizens increase their income, said Ryan Tuttle, a senior consumer finance analyst at the research firm Euromonitor International. They are a powerful economic force for U.S. retailers. Some 2.97 million Chinese tourists spent $33 billion in the U.S. in 2016, up 9% from the previous year, according to a U.S. Commerce Department report. That’s more than any other nationality, the report found. What’s more, Chinese nationals bought 32% of all luxury goods worldwide in 2017, according to the consulting firm Bain. Apparel, beauty and handbags make up the three biggest luxury categories consumers are buying worldwide, and shoes, jewelry and handbags are the three fastest-growing categories, it found. Making payments easier for Chinese tourists will likely be a priority for luxury brand retailers and duty-free shops at airports, as well as transportation services, Miller said. But Alipay probably won’t pick up too many new American users, even if Alipay could connect with U.S.-based bank accounts, Tuttle said. In the U.S., familiar mobile payment systems such as Apple Pay AAPL, +0.78%  and Samsung Pay 005930, -0.98%   still have relatively low adoption rates, so it’s “really unlikely” Alipay would start to take off among Americans, Tuttle said. “So much of whether a payment gets used is its ubiquity,” he said. “Nobody wants to be the one holding up the line at the store.” What’s more, American consumers might be less likely to trust a payment system so closely associated with an overseas company, at a time when there are growing concerns about access to data, he said. They already have shown some distrust of American companies like Amazon AMZN, +1.11% Facebook FB, +4.42%   and Google GOOG, +2.71%   having access to so much of their data. Facebook, in particular, is embroiled in a scandal involving the alleged data breach of 50 million accounts through a third party app. “With Facebook data news coming out this week, people are becoming more aware of who has their data,” Tuttle said.

ACIW,"Germans have started saying “nein” to cash and are moving on to plastic. In many European countries, cash is falling out of vogue, and it’s happening most recently in the land of Oktoberfest, the Autobahn and Angela Merkel. For the first time last year, Germans used cash for less than half of their payments, in terms of total value of sales, according to a survey published Wednesday by Bundesbank, the central bank of Germany. The last time Bundesbank did the survey, in 2014, Germans made 53% of total sales purchases in cash. Why the shift? Card payments have increased, the bank found. Use of the “girocard,” a German debit card network, has increased about six percentage points since 2015 and now makes up 35% of payments in terms of sales purchases. Credit cards have risen slightly in popularity, but still only make up less than 5% of sales purchases in Germany. When it comes to frequency of payments rather than their value, cash still makes up the bulk of German purchases. About 74% of purchases in 2017 were made in banknotes and coins, a drop of just five percentage points since 2014. For small purchases, Germans still prefer cash. But Germany isn’t the only place the move away from cash is happening, according to an October 2017 study from Roubini ThoughtLab, a research firm based in New York, commissioned by the payments company Visa V, +2.25%  . The study examined the “digital maturity” of large cities across the world, in terms of how likely they are to support digital payments instead of cash. Visa obviously has a vested interest in the topic, and has ramped up efforts to get consumers to stop using paper money. “We’re focused on putting cash out of business,” said Visa’s Chief Executive Al Kelly, at the company’s investor day in June. The latest study divided cities into groups based on whether they were more cash-centric or digitally-centric. The rankings were based on surveys with consumers and businesses and data from sources including the World Bank and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The most “digitally mature” cities, according to the study authors, were those with a prevalence of mobile payments, online banking access, ATMs, the ability to receive government benefits digitally, and plenty of shoppers using of plastic debit and credit cards. They include Stockholm, Auckland, Canberra, Copenhagen, Helsinki, London, Ottawa, Sydney and Toronto. No American city is considered among the most “digitally mature.” Major U.S. cities including Austin, Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Washington D.C. were all in the second tier of cities, where people are still more likely to use cash. Why is cash still king in the U.S.? Usage of credit and debit cards has grown in the U.S., but many consumers still prefer cash. Although many U.S. cities have the infrastructure to support digital payments, many people have been slower to adopt them. Only about 20% of North American consumers make purchases with mobile payments regularly, according to an Accenture survey in 2015. In fact, the amount of cash in circulation in the U.S. continues to grow, according to the Federal Reserve. There are currently some 39.8 billion bank notes in circulation, up from 25.6 billion in 2005. Consumers made some 5.8 billion withdrawals from ATMs in 2015, the exact same amount as they did in 2012, but the average amount consumers withdraw during one transaction actually rose from 2012 to 2015, from $118 per transaction to $122, the Fed found. Part of the reason: Some Americans still do not have bank accounts. About 10 million families, or nearly 8% of the households in the U.S., don’t have any type of bank account at an insured institution, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. And even for those who do have bank accounts, there may be little incentive to switch to digital payment options, Mark Ranta, the head of digital banking solutions at ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81%   previously told MarketWatch. “Changing ingrained habits is not something that is easily overcome,” he said. Many consumers don’t want all of their transactions to be traceable, he said. What investors - and everyone else - get wrong about innovation Why is cash less popular in cities overseas? Countries with smaller, more concentrated populations, such as Sweden and the U.K., often have an easier time making the switch to digital, Michelle Evans, the digital consumer manager at Euromonitor International, a market-research firm, previously told MarketWatch. The U.K. has traditionally been a global leader in payment technology. Researchers at Tufts University recently ranked countries by their readiness to go cashless, and the U.K. had one of the highest rankings, along with Sweden, Finland and Denmark. (Mastercard helped to fund the research; credit-card companies including Mastercard take a cut of transactions made on their cards, or through deals they make with institutions that issue the cards, including banks.) London was one of the first cities worldwide to install contactless technology — a terminal that can read a payment card without it having to be swiped — on its public-transportation system. Visa’s study found that the cities where cash is more commonly used were located in Latin America, Africa, the Middle East, Russia and India. In many of those cities, many people are also “unbanked,” and digital payments have not yet become popular. Payments companies including Visa benefit from the push toward a more cashless society and sometimes even offer businesses incentives to stop accepting cash. Visa in July announced it would give up to $10,000 to 50 U.S. restaurants and food vendors who stop accepting cash in favor of credit cards, debit cards and mobile payments. Adam Wand, the group lead of public policy at Visa said the company wants consumers to have choices when they pay, which may still include cash.

ACIW,"There’s a pretty good chance the last time you paid for something, you did it with a debit card. Debit cards were the No. 1 payment method Americans used in 2016, the most recent year for which data was available, according to a report released this week by The Nilson Report, a company that analyzes the card and mobile payments industry. It analyzed data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Consumers made nearly 68 billion transactions on debit cards in 2016, The Nilson Report found, followed by cash with nearly 49 billion transactions and credit cards with about 34.6 billion transactions. Credit cards were third even though they receive a lot of headlines for their often generous rewards. They also have far more generous rules regarding liability and stolen cards than debit cards, most of which cap liability. As cash becomes less popular around the world, cards, including debit, credit, prepaid and electronic benefits transfer (EBT) made up nearly 61% of payment volume in 2016, The Nilson Report found. That will grow to more than 69% by 2021. In 2016, consumers for the first time spent more in terms of monetary value on credit and debit cards than they did in cash, according to the research firm Euromonitor International. Although the use of cards is growing, cash “continues to hold its own,” said David Robertson, the publisher of The Nilson Report. “Changing ingrained habits is not something that is easily overcome,” Mark Ranta, the head of digital banking solutions at ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81% told MarketWatch. Many consumers prefer cash because don’t want all their transactions to be traceable, he said. Everything we thought about millennials' money habits was wrong Some consumers use cash and debit cards to avoid debt. That can pay off for consumers, especially at a time when Americans owe more than $1 trillion in credit card debt, and they are expected to take on even more in 2018. However, those who use debit cards or cash can also miss out on a few benefits, including cashback rewards and, critically, the ability to improve their credit score and, thereby, pay less interest on loans they take out in the future.

ACIW,"Cash could become a relic of the past if credit-card companies have their way. Visa V, +2.25%   announced Wednesday that it will grant up to $10,000 to 50 restaurants and food vendors who stop accepting cash in favor of credit cards, debit cards and mobile payments. “We’re focused on putting cash out of business,” said Visa’s Chief Executive Al Kelly, at the company’s investor day in June. Some restaurants have already stopped accepting cash. The salad chain Sweetgreen announced in December 2016 it would gradually stop accepting cash at all of its locations in New York, California, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and Washington, D.C. throughout 2017. In Boston, state laws require businesses to accept cash payments, so Sweetgreen’s locations there will accept it. But many consumers still resist the idea of a cashless world, whether it’s because of fears about “Big Brother” banks and governments tracking their spending, or because individuals want to keep their transactions under the table. Despite the rise of credit cards and payment apps, the amount of cash in circulation in the U.S. continues to grow, according to the Federal Reserve. There are currently some 39.8 billion bank notes in circulation, up from 25.6 billion in 2005. Banks have made it easier for people to access their cash. Consumers made some 5.8 billion withdrawals from ATMs in 2015, the exact same amount as they did in 2012, but the average amount consumers withdraw during one transaction actually rose from 2012 to 2015, from $118 per transaction to $122, the Fed found. What marriage-phobic millennials mean for the wedding-ring industry Some experts predict the love for cash may not last as they opt for credit-card and mobile payments. U.S. consumers spent some $2.1 trillion in cash transactions in 2016, but that’s forecasted fall to $1.9 trillion in 2021, according to the market-research firm Euromonitor International. Here are two pros (and two cons) of a cashless world: Using cash may help you avoid debt Going on an “all-cash spending diet” is a popular way for consumers to budget and over-spending, by putting a set amount of cash aside, sometimes in envelopes, for specific purposes such as food and entertainment. “Cash forces you to be physically involved in the repercussions of your transaction,” said Janessa Jackson, a 28-year-old who has tried a “cash diet.” “You hand the money over and you receive less back. Swiping does not hold you accountable in the moment.” Others still find it useful to use debit and credit cards, which allows them to keep a paper trail of where they may be overspending. There are also apps that track spending and can point out patterns, but they can’t do that analysis on cash spending. ...and cash may keep store prices down Credit-card companies typically charge merchants between 1% and 3% in processing fees for each transaction made on their cards. But it’s “a contentious point of debate” among the merchants, card issuers and networks whether those processing fees actually make products more expensive for consumers, said Kendrick Sands, a senior consumer finance analyst at Euromonitor International. Card networks recently have provided merchants with consumer-spending data that could make their businesses run more efficiently, therefore saving them some money, which can help keep costs down, he said. Keeping cash in circulation is expensive because governments and banks must pay to produce and store cash, and consumers sometimes lose dollar bills or have them stolen, said Mark Ranta, the head of digital payments at ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81%  , a payment systems company, who obviously has a vested interest in people going cashless. Most businesses already have credit-card fees factored into the price of their products, and they have for many years, said Matt Schulz, a senior industry analyst at the credit-cards website CreditCards.com. But credit cards are cleaner Do you know where your greenbacks have been? In May 2016, a store in Kentucky called Tobacco Road announced it would no longer accept cash that patrons pulled out of their bras or socks, stirring up Internet discussion about how disgusting it is to handle sweaty money. That wasn’t the first time people raised concerns about germy dollars. Cash is made of cotton and linen, materials that make it easy for bacteria to grow, according to a new report about $1 bills in New York City. Researchers from New York University found traces of cocaine, feces, acne agents and dog spit on those bills. Plastic carries less bacteria, they found. ...and cards come with rewards and guarantees In recent months, major banks and credit-card companies have competed to offer better rewards, marking what some have called a “golden age” of rewards points. Some of the most popular premium cards are Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card JPM, +1.82%   and American Express Platinum AXP, +1.16%  , both of which come with a large sign-up bonus. “It’s money in your pocket you wouldn’t otherwise have,” said Kimberly Palmer, a credit cards expert at the personal finance website NerdWallet. But only if you pay off your monthly statement on time: “The benefit comes as long as you can program yourself to make sure you either automate your payments or do it manually, but not letting it go,” she said. Many credit cards come with additional perks including customer service that will negotiate for incorrect charges, Ranta said. Some even come with price-matching, when cards will offer refunds to consumers if they find the same items they already paid for, at lower prices later.

ACIW,"Need to pay your friend, your coworker or your babysitter, but don’t have cash on you? There’s yet another app for that. Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78%   announced Monday at its developer conference it would begin allowing peer-to-peer payments by sending a message through its iMessage app. It will let consumers pay one another without leaving their messaging thread. Apple will also offer a digital debit card called Apple Pay Cash, where users can store their money online. The service will become available at the same time as Apple’s new iOS 11 operating system this fall, according to Recode. Apple did not immediately respond to MarketWatch’s request for comment. Consumers can already send one another money through Facebook’s FB, +4.42%   Messenger app, which is probably the most similar peer-to-peer payments service currently available. There is also a myriad of apps that allow you to pay a friend for a dinner or movie ticket using a smartphone, but experts said Apple’s offering could make them more mainstream. Mobile peer-to-peer payments are projected to quadruple between 2016 and 2021, according to the research firm Forrester. Forrester sees digital payments, including in-app purchases, peer-to-peer payments and retail purchases, reaching $283 billion by 2021, up from an estimated $112 billion at the end of 2016, Barron’s Next reported in February. One of the largest and fastest-growing is PayPal’s PYPL, +1.08%   Venmo, which processed $6.8 billion in transactions in the first quarter of 2017 alone, a 114% increase since the first quarter of 2016. And like Apple’s new peer-to-peer system, Venmo is currently available within iMessage. It is also available as a separate app that consumers can use. They must link a credit card or bank account with the service to use it. It is free to use. Financial institutions are not standing idly by. Several banks have also been working together as part of an organization called Early Warning, and have developed a competitor called Zelle that allows consumers who use different banks to pay one another. Google also allows consumers to pay one another on Google Wallet. And Square Cash also allows peer-to-peer payments and is available already through iMessage. Don’t miss: Is my golfing buddy the cheapest guy in America? He asked me to Venmo him $1.50 The big difference between these and Apple Pay Cash: Apple’s service will be downloaded as part of the iOS upgrade, just like Photos or Maps. Apple’s new addition could make more consumers aware of the various ways they can use their phones to pay one another, “helping to raise the rising tide of peer to peer payments,” said Mark Ranta, the head of digital payments at ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81%  , a payment systems company. Consumers may also appreciate being able to stay within iMessage to complete their transaction, rather than having to visit a separate app, which often has its own password or other type of authentication, Ranta said. But there are a few obvious drawbacks to Apple’s service, said Brendan Miller, a principal analyst at Forrester. Only consumers who have Apple devices, which use iMessage, will be able to use it, he said. And not all of those who have those devices have even registered for Apple Pay. That might make it less desirable than a service like Venmo, which they can use regardless of which device they have. “Venmo is not going away anytime soon,” he said. Indeed, after Apple’s announcement, a spokesman for Venmo remained unfazed by Apple’s announcement. “We welcome any developments that help people move away from the awkwardness of cash,” he said. Apple shares have gained 33% in 2017, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  has gained 7% and the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  has gained 9%.

ACIW,"If you can’t imagine a cash-free world, you aren’t alone — despite the prevalence of credit and debit cards and the rise of mobile payments, more than 80% of all transactions worldwide still happen in cash. And yet the global attachment to cash may not be helping many countries’ economies. Because cash is expensive to store and transport, a switch to digital transactions would ultimately pay off for many countries, according to recent research from Harvard Business Review and experts from Tufts University. To determine which countries would benefit the most from switching to a digital payment system, the researchers considered the cost of cash from four perspectives: those of consumers, businesses, banks and governments, said Bhaskar Chakravorti, the senior associate dean of international business and finance at Tufts University’s Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy, who was one of the study’s researchers. Dogs Have Been Domesticated Twice, Say Scientists For consumers, those costs included ATM fees and the cost of traveling to an ATM or bank branch where they could withdraw cash and the possibility that people can lose cash. For businesses, costs included storing cash and keeping it secure, and transporting it in armored vehicles to banks when necessary. For banks, there are logistical costs, including restocking ATMs and storing and transporting money – especially in countries in the developing world with more security and infrastructure challenges, according to the report. And for governments, there are costs including printing money and the “tax gap,” or the amount of money the government never collects because of unreported or under-reported cash transactions. The report points out that the U.S. alone spends $200 billion annually to keep cash in circulation. The report concludes that the countries that “have the greatest potential for unlocking value” by migrating to a cashless society are the U.S., Netherlands, Japan, Germany, France, Belgium, Spain, Czech Republic, China and Brazil. And while China has made more progress than the U.S. in transitioning its citizens to mobile wallets, it also imposes high costs on them for using cash, according to the report: “Both the U.S. and China would do well to adopt policies in partnership with market actors to nudge their already digitally ready societies towards digital money and unlock massive savings – in time and money – in the process.” See also: Why Greeks are ditching the euro for digital barter systems The challenges Still, there’s a long way to go before going totally cashless is a realistic option in many countries — and the transition could be costly in itself because countries would need the right infrastructure to support a cashless economy. “Changing ingrained habits is not something that is easily overcome,” said Mark Ranta, the head of digital banking solutions at ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81%  , a payment systems company, in an email. “Having physical cash and handing it over to someone is a real experience and one many people use for budgets or to keep their spending habits in check.” And while digital transactions can be a more transparent way of doing business because they are all tracked, said Swee-May Ngeow, a managing director at Accenture Payment Services, not everyone would view that as a positive, Ranta said; there are many people who use cash specifically for its anonymity. Another major hurdle? Unlike cash transactions, which happen instantly, many digital banking transactions take hours or longer to go through, said Ramesh Siromani, a partner in the financial institutions practice of A.T. Kearney, a global strategy and management consulting firm, who has previously worked with global banks on processing their cash. For countries to be cash-free, that delay would have to be eliminated, he said. Plus, digital banking requires individuals to have equipment (most likely a smartphone) to make the transaction, oftentimes a credit or debit card for making payments at retailers and some type of bank account. About 54% of those in emerging and developing countries said they used the internet at least occasionally or owned a smartphone in 2015, compared to 87% of those who did in advanced economies, according to the Pew Research Center, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. (Pew found those numbers by doing phone or in-person interviews with 1,000 or more people in each country surveyed. Here are more details on their methodology). There are approximately 2 billion adults without bank accounts worldwide, according to the World Bank; still, the number of adults with bank accounts is increasing. About 20% more people had a bank account in 2014 than 2011. In the U.S., 8% of adults that the Federal Reserve recently surveyed have no checking, savings or money market account. Many who don’t have bank accounts either don’t qualify or find them too expensive, Ngeow said. Some savings accounts, for example, require minimum deposits and charge a fee when customers don’t meet the minimum. “Cash is the last free alternative,” Ngeow said. Potential problems There are also problems and risks that could arise in a cashless society. In financial systems that are volatile, consumers may feel more comfortable having cash on hand than having their money stored digitally in bank accounts. Plus, credit-card companies take a cut of transactions made on their cards (MasterCard MA, +2.82%   helped fund the HBR and Tufts research). There has already been some pushback from Europeans who want to continue to use cash in countries where governments have put limits on cash transactions. And there are cybersecurity concerns; hackers have repeatedly broken into retailers’ payment systems as well as into central banks in Bangladesh and Ecuador, stealing millions. The future of money Chakravorti said he doesn’t think security concerns will ultimately prevent the switch to digital. “Everything we do in the context of the digital economy … we’re making a tradeoff between having our private information revealed, exposed or stolen in some way, and in exchange for that being able to shop online or have products delivered to my doorstep, or have the variety the internet offers,” he said. Still, he said in a world where an estimated 85% of global transactions are happening in cash, “We have a long way to go.” See also These 7 data points reveal the sorry state of Americans’ finances Will Pizza Hut soon be run by robots?

ACIW,"Ledge If someone asks me to loan them money, I usually run quickly in the other direction. After all, the last thing I want is to end up the subject of a “Moneyologist” column. That was until this week, when my friend Curtis asked me for $50 for lunch money. Curtis asked for the money through Ledge, a new app that claims to “remove the awkwardness of asking friends for money.” The app is aimed at people needing micro loans—from $50 to $5,000 for things like moving costs, pursuing a passion project, or starting a business. Or lunch. (Disclaimer: Curtis can afford his own sushi. He initiated the request as a way to test the app.) Ledge is available on iOS and Android, and it has attracted attention on popular tech-product launchpad Product Hunt. Peer-to-peer lending is a growing industry, as borrowers seek ways to bypass banks and avoid credit card debt, and as more startups emerge, seeking to disrupt traditional financial processes. Ledge makes peer-to-peer lending more “millennial” by turning the process of getting a loan into a social engagement. Ledge is designed to work like a crowdfunding campaign, but funders are supposed to get their money back with interest -- crowdloaning. Borrowers set their own interest rate and payback period, and post their loan “campaign” to Twitter, Facebook and other social networks. Money doesn’t exchange hands until the loan is fully funded. Data show there could be a market for it: The average amount of debt millennials carry is $26,485, including student loans but excluding mortgages, according to Experian data, and they have the lowest credit score of all generations. What’s in it for the lenders? Ledge claims that automated payments through PayPal-owned mobile payments app Venmo PYPL, +1.08%  make it easy for borrowers to repay the loan, and lenders can make some money while also helping out a friend. “When you lend some money out to a friend, you can take on more risk for a higher reward,” said Mark Ranta, head of Digital Banking Solutions at ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81%  which makes payment processing systems used in banks and retailers. “The idea of peer-to-peer lending is a great idea when you’re talking small increments,” he continued. “It’s unlikely you would go to a bank to get a $500 loan. The hassle of that — I don’t know if the bank would even do it.” I was intrigued, so I gave Curtis the remaining $42 he needed for “lunch.” Our exchange went like this: And there’s the potential problem: Ledge doesn’t offer any real guarantee I will get my $42 back. “Ledge is not a party to your agreement, and we don’t currently engage in collections or formal credit reporting,” according to the company’s website. Whether the loan is a legally enforceable agreement — i.e., you can sue if you don’t get your money back — appears to vary by state, according to Ledge’s website. Ledge didn't return requests for comment. “Anytime you don’t protect the consumer, that’s where you can see the benefit of a bank,” Ranta said. “The [banks are] the ones taking on the risk... so if they lose that investment, it’s on them, not you.” It’s a risk: I could make $4.20 off this transaction, or I could lose $42 and our friendship if Curtis takes my money and runs. Ledge raised $900,000 in seed funding in late September, according to CrunchBase. That sounds like small beans, but the peer-to-peer lending sector is attracting plenty of investment. Kabbage, which allows people to fund small businesses, closed a $50 million funding round led by SoftBank Capital in May, bringing the total equity raised by Kabbage to $106 million. Prosper Marketplace claims to be America’s first peer-to-peer lending marketplace, and functions more like a bank than Ledge. Prosper does not allow lenders to contact borrowers, and Prosper ensures all collection activity is performed by licensed agencies. In April, Prosper announced $165 million in new financing, valuing the company at $1.7 billion and landing it in the “unicorn” club of startups valued at more than $1 billion. Prosper takes a cut of each loan via closing and servicing fees, plus it levies failed and late payment fees and a collection agency fee. Ledge, on the other hand, isn’t making a dime off my transaction with Curtis. Currently, Ledge users don’t pay any fees. Ledge CEO Adam Neff said in a post on ProductHunt that it intends to eventually provide paid financial services, such as credit building services. Ranta said he doesn’t suspect Ledge will encourage loans greater than a few hundred dollars purely because of the risk. But he said the app does have potential among the fresh-into-adulthood crowd, who might need $1,000 to pay rent but could pay it back when their next paycheck arrives. “If you split that out to 20 people and each person gives $50, that’s less of a risk,” he said. For the record, I’m certain Curtis had a nice $50 lunch, but he still hasn’t paid me back. More from MarketWatch Can the Democrats Ride a Blue Wave to Midterm Election Wins?

ACIW,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Among the stocks that could see active trade in Monday’s session are Wolverine World Wide Inc., S1 Corp. and Arch Coal Inc. Auto companies are set to report sales results for September later Monday. Among the major publicly traded U.S. manufacturers, General Motors Co. GM, +2.45%  and Ford Motor Co. F, +2.03% are expected to show monthly increases of 19% and 11%, respectively. These would outpace the overall growth rate of 8.3% as forecast by Edmunds.com. In a light day on the earnings front, Wolverine World Wide WWW, +0.10%  raised its full-year financial outlook as the Rockford, Mich.-based company’s reported results for the third quarter ended Sept. 10. As revised, the company now estimates full-year earnings in a range of from $2.46 to $2.52 a share, with revenue pegged at $1.4 billion to $1.43 billion. Wolverine’s quarterly earnings rose to $40.4 million, or 82 cents a share, from $34.1 million, or 70 cents, earned in the same period a year earlier, as revenue grew 13% to $361.6 million. Analysts polled by FactSet Research had, on average, been expecting earnings of 75 cents a share on sales of $357.6 million. Agco Corp. AGCO, +1.15%  said it’s agreed to buy GSI Holdings Corp., a Illinois-based manufacturer of grain-storage and protein-production systems, from Centerbridge Partners LP for $940 million.

The revised outlook, the St. Louis-based company said late Friday, largely stems from metallurgical-coal output lost from its Mountain Laurel complex in West Virginia. The mine “encountered unfavorable geologic conditions,” Arch Coal said, and its longwall was idled for nearly 45 days after a roof fell in August; production work restarted in late September. Wisconsin-based OshKosh Corp. OSK, +1.35%  said Saturday the United Auto Workers local representing production workers rejected a proposal for a new five-year labor contract. The company called the proposal “attractive” and said its terms were “necessary to sustain Oshkosh employment at a time of federal employee wage freezes, significant defense spending cuts and increased competition for defense contracts.” The union, according to the company, said that “sticking points are non-monetary,” and the two sides were working on the details of a meeting as requested by the local.

EXC, +1.22% is buying Antelope Valley Solar Ranch One, while affiliates of NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, +0.65% and GE Energy Financial Services GE, -1.46% are the Desert Sunlight project.

ACIW,"(Updates to add analyst comments and a new stock quote.) NEW YORK (DOW JONES) -- Fundtech Ltd. FNDT confirmed the software company is in preliminary talks with suitors that have expressed interest in a possible merger or acquisition, although it said no agreement has been reached. Shares of Fundtech were recently up 16% to $20.10 amid a broad market rally. In response to media reports, Fundtech--which licenses software products to banks--said one of the deals being discussed was a merger with a U.S.-based company. Additionally, Fundtech was recently approached by a multinational firm expressing interest in an acquisition. D.A. Davidson analyst John Kraft said he wasn't surprised Fundtech was an acquisition target, saying the company offers ""a pretty narrow niche with a great customer base and a great reputation within the product suite."" Kraft said growing volume of banking payments is causing big banks to reevaluate legacy systems and seek out vendors that can help them better process those payments. He said more banks were looking for expert help rather than looking in house for solutions. According to Kraft, possible suitors were most likely direct competitors. He named Bottomline Technologies Inc. EPAY, +2.40% as the most likely, as the provider of payment, invoice and document automation software has been acquisitive recently and has a chunk of cash on its balance sheet. Another possible suitor is ACI Worldwide Inc. ACIW, +0.81% according to Kraft. Representatives from Bottomline and ACI weren't immediately available to comment. Shares of Bottomline were up 3.5% to $22.76, while ACI's stock rose 3% to $29.83. In a prepared statement, Fundtech said it doesn't intend to make any additional comments regarding the talks until a formal agreement is reached or it is otherwise required to issue a statement. Last month, Fundtech reported its first-quarter profit surged 71% on across-the-board revenue increases from software, maintenance and services. During the quarter, the company closed on 110 new deals and added four new bank customers. Fundtech's customers include Bank of America Corp. (BAC), Barclays PLC (BCS, BARC.LN) and HSBC Holdings PLC (HBC, HSBA.LN), according to Kraft.

ACIW,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW ACI Worldwide, the Universal Payments (""UP"") company, powers electronic payments for more than 5,100 organizations around the world. More than 1,000 of the largest banks and financial intermediaries, as well as thousands of global merchants, rely on ACI to execute $14 trillion each day in payments and securities. In addition, thousands of organizations utilize our EBPP services. Through our comprehensive suite of SaaS and Platform solutions, we deliver real-time, immediate payments capabilities, and enable a complete omni-channel payments experience. Our products are sold and supported through distribution networks covering three geographic regions - the Americas, EMEA, and Asia/Pacific. Each distribution network has its own globally coordinated sales force and supplements its sales force with independent reseller and/or distributor networks. These products and solutions are used globally by banks, financial intermediaries, merchants, and corporates, such as third-party electronic payment processors, payment associations, switch interchanges and a wide range of transaction-generating endpoints, including ATMs, merchant point-of-sale (""POS"") terminals, bank branches, mobile phones, tablets, corporations, and Internet commerce sites. Accordingly, our business and operating results are influenced by trends such as information technology spending levels, the growth rate of the electronic payments industry, mandated regulatory changes, and changes in the number and type of customers in the financial services industry. Our products are marketed under the ACI Worldwide, ACI Universal Payment, and ACI UP brands. We derive a majority of our revenues from domestic operations and believe we have large opportunities for growth in international markets as well as continued expansion domestically in the United States. Refining our global infrastructure is a critical component of driving our growth. We have launched a globalization strategy which includes elements intended to streamline our supply chain and maximize expertise in several geographic locations to support a growing international customer base and competitive needs. We utilize our Irish subsidiaries to manage certain of our intellectual property rights and to oversee and manage certain international product development and commercialization efforts. We increased our SaaS and Platform capabilities with a data center in Ireland allowing our SaaS and Platform solutions to be more-broadly offered in the European market. We also continue to grow centers of expertise in Timisoara, Romania and Pune and Bangalore in India, as well as key operational centers such as Cape Town, South Africa and in multiple locations in the United States. Key trends that currently impact our strategies and operations include: Increasing electronic payment transaction volumes. Electronic payment volumes continue to increase around the world, taking market share from traditional cash and check transactions. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that electronic payment transactions will grow in volume at an annual rate of 6.7%, from 481 billion in 2016 to 624.6 billion in 2020, with varying growth rates based on the type of payment and part of the world. We leverage the growth in transaction volumes through the licensing of new systems to customers whose older systems cannot handle increased volume and through the licensing of capacity upgrades to existing customers. Adoption of real-time payments. Customer expectations, from both consumers and corporate, are driving the payments world to more real-time delivery. In the U.K., payments sent through the traditional ACH multi-day batch service can now be sent through the Faster Payments service giving almost immediate access to the funds, and this is being considered and implemented in several countries including Australia and the United States. In the U.S. market, NACHA implemented phase 2 of Same Day ACH in September 2017. Corporate customers expect real-time information on the status of their payments instead of waiting for an end of-day report. Regulators expect banks to be monitoring key measures like liquidity in real time. ACI's focus has always been on the real-time execution of transactions and delivery of information through real-time tools, such as dashboards, so our experience will be valuable in addressing this trend. Increasing competition. The electronic payments market is highly competitive and subject to rapid change. Our competition comes from in-house information technology departments, third-party electronic payment processors, and third-party software companies located both within and outside of the United States. Many of these companies are significantly larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical, and marketing resources. As electronic payment transaction volumes increase, third-party processors tend to provide competition to our solutions, particularly among customers that do not seek to differentiate their electronic payment offerings or are eliminating banks from the payments service, reducing the need for our solutions. As consolidation in the financial services industry continues, we anticipate that competition for those customers will intensify. Table of Contents Adoption of cloud technology. In an effort to leverage lower-cost computing technologies, some banks, financial intermediaries, merchants, and corporates are seeking to transition their systems to make use of cloud technology. Our investments provide us the grounding to deliver cloud capabilities in the future. Market sizing data from Ovum indicates that spend on SaaS and Platform payment systems is growing faster than spend on installed applications. Electronic payments fraud and compliance. As electronic payment transaction volumes increase, organized criminal organizations continue to find ways to commit a growing volume of fraudulent transactions using a wide range of techniques. Banks, financial intermediaries, merchants and corporates continue to seek ways to leverage new technologies to identify and prevent fraudulent transactions and other attacks such as denial of service attacks. Due to concerns with international terrorism and money laundering, banks and financial intermediaries in particular are being faced with increasing scrutiny and regulatory pressures. We continue to see opportunity to offer our fraud detection solutions to help customers manage the growing levels of electronic payments fraud and compliance activity. Adoption of smartcard technology. In many markets, card issuers are being required to issue new cards with embedded chip technology, with the liability shift having gone into effect in 2015 in the United States. Chip-based cards are more secure, harder to copy, and offer the opportunity for multiple functions on one card (e.g., debit, credit, electronic purse, identification, health records, etc.). This results in greater card-not-present fraud (e.g., fraud at eCommerce sites). Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA). The SEPA, primarily focused on the European economic community and the U.K., is designed to facilitate lower costs for cross-border payments and reduce timeframes for settling electronic payment transactions. The transition to SEPA payment mechanisms will drive more volume to these systems with the potential to cause banks to review the capabilities of the systems supporting these payments. Our Retail Payments and Real-Time Payments solutions facilitate key functions that help banks and financial intermediaries address these mandated regulations. European Payment Service Directive (PSD2). PSD2, which was ratified by the European Parliament in 2015, will force member states to implement new payments regulation by 2018. The XS2A provision effectively creates a new market opportunity where banks in European Union member countries must provide open API standards to customer data, thus allowing authorized third-party providers to enter the market. Financial institution consolidation. Consolidation continues on a national and international basis, as financial institutions seek to add market share and increase overall efficiency. Such consolidations have increased, and may continue to increase, in their number, size, and market impact as a result of recent economic conditions affecting the banking and financial industries. There are several potential negative effects of increased consolidation activity. Continuing consolidation of financial institutions may result in a smaller number of existing and potential customers for our products and services. Consolidation of two of our customers could result in reduced revenues if the combined entity were to negotiate greater volume discounts or discontinue use of certain of our products. Additionally, if a non-customer and a customer combine and the combined entity decides to forego future use of our products, our revenue would decline. Conversely, we could benefit from the combination of a non-customer and a customer when the combined entity continues use of our products and, as a larger combined entity, increases its demand for our products and services. We tend to focus on larger financial institutions as customers, often resulting in our solutions being the solutions that survive in the consolidated entity. Global vendor sourcing. Global and regional banks, financial intermediaries, merchants, and corporates are aiming to reduce the costs in supplier management by picking suppliers who can service them across all their geographies instead of allowing each country operation to choose suppliers independently. Our global footprint from both a customer and a delivery perspective enable us to be successful in this global sourced market. However, projects in these environments tend to be more complex and therefore of higher risk. Electronic payments convergence. As electronic payment volumes grow and pressures to lower overall cost per transaction increase, banks and financial intermediaries are seeking methods to consolidate their payments processing across the enterprise. We believe that the strategy of using service-oriented architectures to allow for re-use of common electronic payment functions, such as authentication, authorization, routing and settlement, will become more common. Using these techniques, banks and financial intermediaries will be able to reduce costs, increase overall service levels, enable one-to-one marketing in multiple bank channels, leverage volumes for improved pricing and liquidity, and manage enterprise risk. Our product strategy is, in part, focused on this trend, by creating integrated payment functions that can be re-used by multiple bank channels, across both the consumer and wholesale bank. While this trend presents an opportunity for us, it may also expand the competition from third-party electronic payment technology and service providers specializing in other forms of electronic payments. Many of these providers are larger than us and have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources. Table of Contents Mobile banking and payments. There is a growing demand for the ability to carry out banking services or make payments using a mobile phone. Recent statistics from Javelin Strategy & Research, a subsidiary of Greenwich Associates, show that 50% of adults in the United States use their phone for mobile banking. The use of phones for mobile banking is expected to grow to 81% in 2020. Our customers have been making use of existing products to deploy mobile banking, mobile payments, and mobile commerce solutions for their customers in many countries. In addition, ACI has invested in mobile products of our own and via partnerships to support mobile functionality in the marketplace. Electronic bill payment and presentment. EBPP encompasses all facets of bill payment, including biller direct, where customers initiate payments on biller websites, the consolidator model, where customers initiate payments on a financial institution's website, and walk-in bill payment, as one might find in a convenience store. The EBPP market continues to grow as consumers move away from traditional forms of paper-based payments. According to Aite Group, the percentage of online payments made on biller sites grew from 62% in 2010 to 73% in 2016. The biller-direct solutions are seeing strong growth as billers migrate these services to outsourcers, such as ACI, from legacy systems built in house. We believe that EBPP remains ripe for outsourcing, as a significant amount of biller-direct transactions are still processed in house. As billers seek to manage costs and improve efficiency, we believe that they will continue to look to third-party EBPP vendors that can offer a complete solution for their billing needs. The banking, financial services, and payment industries have come under increased scrutiny from federal, state, and foreign lawmakers and regulators in response to the crises in the financial markets and the global recession. In particular, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ""Dodd-Frank Act""), which was signed into law July 21, 2010, represents a comprehensive overhaul of the U.S. financial services industry and requires the implementation of many regulations that have a direct impact on our customers and potential customers. This is not limited to the United States. In April 2014, the European Commission voted to adopt a number of amendments with regards to the Payment Services Directive, placing further pressure on industry incumbents. These regulatory changes may create both opportunities and challenges for us. The application of the new regulations on our customers could create an opportunity for us to market our product capabilities and the flexibility of our solutions to assist our customers in addressing these regulations. At the same time, these regulatory changes may have an adverse impact on our operations and our financial results as we adjust our activities in light of increased compliance costs and customer requirements. It is currently too difficult to predict the long-term extent to which the Dodd-Frank Act, Payment Services Directive or the resulting regulations will impact our business and the businesses of our current and potential customers. Several other factors related to our business may have a significant impact on our operating results from year to year. For example, the accounting rules governing the timing of revenue recognition in the software industry are complex and it can be difficult to estimate when we will recognize revenue generated by a given transaction. Factors such as maturity of the software product licensed, payment terms, creditworthiness of the customer, and timing of delivery or acceptance of our products often cause revenues related to sales generated in one period to be deferred and recognized in later periods. For arrangements in which services revenue is deferred, related direct and incremental costs may also be deferred. Additionally, while the majority of our contracts are denominated in the U.S. dollar, a substantial portion of our sales are made, and some of our expenses are incurred, in the local currency of countries other than the United States. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates in a given period may result in the recognition of gains or losses for that period. We continue to seek ways to grow through organic sources, partnerships, alliances, and acquisitions. We continually look for potential acquisitions designed to improve our solutions' breadth or provide access to new markets. As part of our acquisition strategy, we seek acquisition candidates that are strategic, capable of being integrated into our operating environment and financially accretive to our financial performance. Divestiture Community Financial Services On March 3, 2016, we completed the sale of our CFS related assets and liabilities to Fiserv for $200.0 million. The sale of CFS, which was not strategic to our long-term strategy, is part of the Company's ongoing efforts to expand as a provider of software products and SaaS-based and Platform-based solutions facilitating real-time electronic and eCommerce payments for large banks, financial intermediaries, merchants, and corporates worldwide. The sale included employee agreements and customer contracts as well as technology assets and intellectual property. For the year-ended December 31, 2016, we recognized a net after-tax gain of $93.4 million on sale of assets to Fiserv. Backlog Included in backlog estimates are all software license fees, maintenance fees and services fees (including SaaS and Platform) specified in executed contracts, as well as revenues from assumed contract renewals to the extent that we believe recognition of the related revenue will occur within the corresponding backlog period. We have historically included assumed renewals in backlog estimates based upon automatic renewal provisions in the executed contract and our historic experience with customer renewal rates. Table of Contents Our 60-month backlog estimate represents expected revenues from existing customers using the following key assumptions: Maintenance fees are assumed to exist for the duration of the license term for those contracts in which the committed maintenance term is less than the committed license term. License, facilities management, and SaaS and Platform arrangements are assumed to renew at the end of their committed term at a rate consistent with our historical experiences. Non-recurring license arrangements are assumed to renew as recurring revenue streams. Foreign currency exchange rates are assumed to remain constant over the 60-month backlog period for those contracts stated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Our pricing policies and practices are assumed to remain constant over the 60-month backlog period. In computing our 60-month backlog estimate, the following items are specifically not taken into account: Anticipated increases in transaction, account, or processing volumes in customer systems. Optional annual uplifts or inflationary increases in recurring fees. Services engagements, other than facilities management and SaaS and Platform engagements, are not assumed to renew over the 60-month backlog period. The potential impact of merger activity within our markets and/or customers. We review our customer renewal experience on an annual basis. The impact of this review and subsequent update may result in a revision to the renewal assumptions used in computing the 60-month and 12-month backlog estimates. In the event a revision to renewal assumptions is determined to be necessary, prior periods will be adjusted for comparability purposes. The following table sets forth our 60-month backlog estimate, by reportable segment, as of December 31, 2017, September 30, 2017, June 30, 2017, March 31, 2017, and December 31, 2016 (in millions). Dollar amounts reflect foreign currency exchange rates as of each period end.

Amounts expected to be recognized from assumed contract renewals are based on our historical renewal experience. We also estimate 12-month backlog, segregated between monthly recurring and non-recurring revenues, using a methodology consistent with the 60-month backlog estimate. Monthly recurring revenues include all monthly license fees, maintenance fees and SaaS and Platform processing services fees. Non-recurring revenues include other software license fees and services fees. Amounts included in our 12-month backlog estimate assume renewal of one-time license fees on a monthly fee basis if such renewal is expected to occur in the next 12 months. The following table sets forth our 12-month backlog estimate, by segment, as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 (in millions). For all periods reported, approximately 75% of our 12-month backlog estimate is committed backlog and approximately 25% of our 12-month backlog estimate is renewal backlog. Dollar amounts reflect currency exchange rates as of each period end. Table of Contents  December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Monthly Non- Monthly Non- Recurring Recurring Total Recurring Recurring Total ACI On Premise $ 294 $ 72 $ 366 $ 298 $ 79 $ 377 ACI On Demand 459 - 459 439 - 439 Total $ 753 $ 72 $ 825 $ 737 $ 79 $ 816  Estimates of future financial results require substantial judgment and are based on a number of assumptions as described above. These assumptions may turn out to be inaccurate or wrong, including for reasons outside of management's control. For example, our customers may attempt to renegotiate or terminate their contracts for a number of reasons, including mergers, changes in their financial condition, or general changes in economic conditions in the customer's industry or geographic location, or we may experience delays in the development or delivery of products or services specified in customer contracts which may cause the actual renewal rates and amounts to differ from historical experience. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates may also impact the amount of revenue actually recognized in future periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that amounts included in backlog estimates will actually generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the corresponding 12-month or 60-month period. Additionally, because backlog estimates are operating metrics, the estimates are not required to be subject to the same level of internal review or controls as a U.S. GAAP financial measure.

ACIW,"NEW YORK, Mar 13, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- SmartMetric, Inc. (otcqb:SMME) - Research published, 2017 by the Nilson Report* shows that global credit card fraud has cost more than $22 billion in 2016. To make things worse, ACI Worldwide (an electronic payment systems company) estimates that 46% of Americans have had their card information compromised at some point in the past 5 years. In addition to the $22 billion loss figure, according to research by LexisNexis*, the LexisNexis Fraud Multiplier [SM] , which estimates the total amount of loss a business incurs, based on chargebacks, fees, interest, merchandise replacement and redistribution. In 2017, every dollar of fraud to merchants and firms it is estimated to cost $2.66 on average. For organizations selling digital goods and / or primarily transacting through remote channels, the cost is estimated to be even higher, at $3.48 per dollar of fraud, on average. This accounts for more than two percent of these businesses' annual revenues, according to the research. ""Card fraud is without a doubt a serious cost to business and the overall economy today,"" said Chaya Hendrick, President & CEO of SmartMetric. The solution for banks and bank customers in combating card fraud is the new SmartMetric Biometric Card. The SmartMetric biometric ""anti-fraud"" card has a built in nano fingerprint scanner that has been designed from the ground up with both the bank and consumer in mind. The SmartMetric biometric card works with existing credit card payments and transaction infrastructure such as global networks that carry the information between banks and card merchants as well as using existing chip ready point of sale card readers and ATM's. SmartMetric is a USA based company that has spent over a decade in research and development to create its leading biometric credit/debit card product. It has a team of advanced engineers in Tel Aviv, Israel and has card assembly manufacturing facilities in various parts of the world. The SmartMetric biometric card technology has been developed solely by SmartMetric, which includes component engineering, electronic, design, motherboard creation and advanced mass small component assembly. The card is powered by a rechargeable battery providing years of card life while employing a very simple biometric fingerprint registration on the card similar to what consumers have become accustomed to with fingerprint recognition smartphones. SmartMetric biometric cards are available to Banks in the United States through SmartMetric's distributor, PROTEC Secure Card. PROTEC Secure Card (PSC), based in New Jersey, USA.

ACIW,"ASEAN financial institutions are focusing increasing investment on payments modernization, with real-time payments capabilities serving as the first step to digital transformation across consumer and corporate services, per new benchmark data, “2018 ASEAN Payments Insight Survey: Real-Time Payments Modernization and Innovation,” from ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81% and Ovum. ASEAN member states, driven by market forces and developments in the wider Asia-Pacific region, are looking at how real-time payments can act as a catalyst for payments modernization and future innovation – though member states are currently at different levels of technical and economic sophistication, as reflected by investment plans. Enthusiasm for real-time payments, a clear understanding of the benefits of open APIs – used to connect banking services with instant payment-enabled services – and proactive collaboration between central infrastructures and banks put the ASEAN region in a strong position to realize multi-currency, cross-border real-time payments. Principal study findings include: Real-time payments will enable innovative new service offerings and drive revenue growth 82 percent of respondents feel that real-time payments will drive revenue growth for their organizations and 77 percent say they will save money. 86 percent of respondents overall (100% in Vietnam and Malaysia) believe that real-time payments have, or will, improve their customer services, and 89 percent have developed or are developing new services for consumers based on instant payments. 78 percent of ASEAN institutions think that real-time payments will replace the use of payment cards over time. Clear understanding of benefits of open APIs amongst ASEAN banks 97 percent of respondents in ASEAN agree that the business benefits of open APIs are clear, versus 90 percent globally and 88 percent across Asia. ASEAN banks are less clear on strategies for the creation of open APIs for third-party use – 84 percent compared to 87 percent globally and 91 percent in Asia. ASEAN spending growth outpaces other regions 64 percent of ASEAN financial institutions forecast investment in payments to increase in the next 18-24 months, compared to 56 percent in the broader Asia region and 53 percent globally. Planned payments investment varies widely across ASEAN; 53 percent of Singapore expect investment to increase a lot (5+%) compared to 30 percent in Indonesia and 13 percent in Malaysia and Thailand. Reducing total cost of ownership is a top three investment priority for most respondents (47%), with a move away from in-house development toward customized third-party software or off-the-shelf vendor solutions (from 8% to 13% over the next 2 years). “Short-term investment plans are setting the base for long-term, strategic developments, as many organizations address core ‘hygiene’ factors to create a sound platform for payments innovation,” said Leslie Choo, GM & vice president – Asia, ACI Worldwide. “Getting the house in order will be a precursor to developing services that enhance the customer experience, and truly reaping the benefits of innovation. The prospect of real-time, cross-border payments in the ASEAN region – and beyond – is another reason why ASEAN financial institutions are increasing investment, and the enthusiasm for real-time demonstrates that bank executives see this as a primary catalyst.” “The rapid development of real-time payments – in Asia generally but in ASEAN countries in particular – has lessons for banks, central infrastructure operators and merchant service providers around the world, as they work towards the realization for the first cross-border, multi-currency, real-time payments network,” said David Bannister, principal analyst, Ovum. “The survey results show that ASEAN banks are focusing increased investment on ensuring that they are able to participate and compete in the emerging ecosystem; security – a prerequisite in payments – is front of mind for many, but all are looking ahead to the innovation opportunities created by the combination of real-time payments and API-based open banking.” To receive a complimentary copy of the report, please visit: www.aciworldwide.com/money2020asia * Methodology and Demographics: For the 2018 Ovum Global Payment Information Survey, Ovum and ACI Worldwide partnered to run a 22 question survey across a sample of retail banks. Overall, the 2018 Ovum Global Payment Information Survey included a total 1,032 executive respondents across 13 industry sub verticals in 19 countries, resulting in over 225,000 separate data points on current perceptions and investment plans around payments technology on a global basis. This includes 277 retail banks, of which 75 operate in the ASEAN countries. The aim of the survey was to understand the current attitudes, business objectives and operational pain points facing each respondent company, in turn creating a unique viewpoint on the role that investments in payments technology will underpin both the immediate and future objectives of each institution. The main topics of focus for the survey include: IT investment plans around payment services Core business objectives and priorities Payment systems architectures including SaaS Plans and experiences around both open banking and real-time payments Fieldwork ran between January 2018 and February 2018, providing a clear insight into current thinking in the industry across financial institutions in the region. This paper focuses on the survey findings for banks in the ASEAN region.

ACIW,"ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81% a leading global provider of real-time electronic payment and banking solutions, together with AGS Transact Technologies(AGSTTL), India’s leading end-to-end payment solutions company, have unveiled ‘Transactions 2025,’ with in-depth insights into India’s digital payments revolution. It outlines the key growth drivers for digital payments in India’s burgeoning banking and fintech industry. Additionally, it highlights the steps that financial institutions, retailers, and billing organizations can take to help them better prepare for – and respond to – shifts in the payments space. By 2025, digital transactions in India could be worth $1 trillion annually, with four out of every five transactions being made digitally. UPI (Unified Payments Interface) transactions are a key driver of greater financial inclusion, as the Indian payments ecosystem undergoes rapid digital transformation. Mass adoption of e-payments and a thriving fintech scene, combined with regulatory policy, are set to propel India into a leading position in the global payments landscape. Key findings of the research: India’s smartphone user base will likely double to 500 million by 2020; increasingly affordable devices and data will spur safe, fraud-resistant digital transactions based on biometrics and multi-factor authorization, as well as an explosion of consumer services via mobile internet. Based on India’s current growth trajectory, the country could boast a $1 trillion market for digital transactions by 2025, with cash to non-cash ration reversing (4 out of 5 payments made digitally). The user base for digital transactions in India is currently close to 90 million, but could triple to 300 million by 2020 as the use cases for digital transactions grow and new users from rural and semi-urban areas enter the market. Initiatives such as UPI (Unified Payments Interface) payments are driving greater interoperability between banks, independent of acquirer, payment provider or mobile app. Connected devices (Internet of Things) will further drive payments digitization – in India and globally – with around 30 billion connected devices anticipated globally by 2025. Cyberattacks cost India an estimated $4 billion annually, and could rise to $20 billion by 2025, with the digitization of payments presenting new challenges for cybersecurity. “India is undergoing an incredible transformation driven by the rapid digitalization of payments,” said Manish Patel, Vice President, ACI Worldwide. “The findings of our new research reinforce our view that flexible, scalable and reliable technology will be critical to the future of payments in India as the market continues to experience incredible growth.” Mahesh Patel, Group Chief Technology Officer, AGS Transact Technologies Limited, said, “we understand that rapid rise in internet users nationwide is spurring an increase in digital transactions. However, the Indian market unlike many Western nations is still to mature and remains threatened due to lower awareness levels. Hence, it is necessary that the rise in digital transactions remain holistic thereby supporting growth with scalable processing platform. Also, it should be accompanied by allied precautionary measures such as cyber security and fraud prevention.” Announced last week, ACI has implemented a customized, UPI-enabled version of its UP Retail Payments solution, supporting the growth of UPI payments across India. AGSTLL, a long-standing strategic partner of ACI, is the first to bring the suite of hosted processing solutions and fraud monitoring to market.

ACIW,"AGS Transact Technologies (AGSTTL), India’s leading end-to-end payment solutions provider, and ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81% a leading global provider of real-time electronic payment and banking solutions, today announced the launch of a UPI-specific suite of solutions that encompasses processing, fraud monitoring and reconciliation and settlement within ACI’s market-leading UP Retail Payments solution. AGSTTL, a longstanding ACI strategic partner, is the first organization to implement this solution, designed exclusively to support Unified Payments Interface (UPI) transactions in India. The rapid digitalization of payments in India, including the National Payments Corporation of India’s (NPCI’s) UPI initiative, has led to massive growth in the number of fintechs and other organizations seeking to capitalize on this payments transformation across the country. Per recent RBI data, UPI-enabled transactions crossed the 151.7 mn mark in January, undergoing a 4 percent increase from the 145.5 mn transactions registered in December 2017. Similarly, the value of transactions also jumped by 18 percent month on month, from $2 bn (INR 131.4 bn) in December 2017 to $2.4 bn (INR 155.4 bn) in January 2018. Anticipating immense future growth potential, the NPCI has formulated a strategy and set of specifications that enables banks, third parties and central payments infrastructures to work together with fintechs in a streamlined manner, and provide interoperability through a single interface and single set of APIs. ACI’s UP Retail Payments solution delivers 24x7, secure payment capabilities, and is used by 8 of the world’s top 10 banks. The solution enables stakeholders to access the set of APIs developed by NPCI, and connects banks’ issuing systems to central infrastructures and to payment service providers (PSPs). Created specifically for the Indian market and made available to ACI’s broad customer base, AGSTTL has launched the solution via a hosted model, as the digitalization of payments in India continues to gather pace. “ACI’s Universal Payments capabilities have enabled us to integrate cross-channel payments, real-time fraud prevention and transaction management capabilities into our end-to-end payment solutions,” said Mahesh Patel, President & Group CTO, AGS Transact Technologies. “Our ability to directly address the evolving needs of the Indian market – especially UPI payments – continues to be based on the outstanding cloud-based managed services that ACI delivers.” “India is undergoing tremendous payments transformation; therefore, it is imperative that the country’s payments infrastructure delivers efficiency and scalability,” said Manish Patel, Vice President, ACI Worldwide. “ACI is a long-standing and trusted provider of critical payments capabilities within the Indian market; expanding our relationship with AGSTTL and bringing to market our UPI-enabled UP Retail Payments solution is another milestone in delivering flexible, scalable and reliable technology as payments in India continue to reach new heights.” “ACI has a proven track record in the Indian market, having supported major banks and financial organizations for many years with reliable, scalable payments technology,” said Dr. Rajendran, Chief Technology Officer, National Payments Corporation of India. “As adoption of UPI payments gathers pace, ACI, together with AGSTTL, will play a key role in enabling innovation and connecting financial institutions, banks and merchants across the diverse Indian payments ecosystem.” About ACI Worldwide ACI Worldwide, the Universal Payments (UP) company, powers electronic payments for more than 5,100 organizations around the world.

As financial institutions across Europe are preparing for the launch of several domestic and pan-European schemes, ACI will feature its solution supporting connection to the central infrastructures across the region. The first pan-European scheme, SEPA Instant Credit Transfer (SCTinst), was launched in November last year and another pan-European scheme, the TARGET Instant Payment Settlement (TIPS), is set to go live in 2018. In addition, several national schemes will be launched: Belgium, Slovenia, Spain, Portugal are all set to get their own national schemes, followed by France, Holland and Hungary in 2019. ACI is offering all financial institutions and PSPs a multi-scheme solution based on a standard European SEPA Inst gateway that can be quickly modified to suit the requirements of any domestic or pan-European instant scheme. ACI’s UP Real-Time Payments is also positioned to seamlessly integrate with the TIPS and other pan-EU real-time payments services. Institutions can act now by using ACI’s solution for any local and pan-EU scheme, and securely transition to a new TIPS settlement account once TIPS goes live in November 2018. To simplify the move to real-time payments with a lower risk approach, ACI offers a pre-packaged cloud solution for the major pan-EU instant payments schemes. Advanced liquidity management services are built in to manage fragmented multi-scheme settlement accounts from day one. Domenico Scaffidi, Principal Solution Consultant Immediate Payments, ACI Worldwide, comments: “This event will be a great opportunity for financial institutions and vendors alike to come together and discuss the opportunities and challenges of instant payments. With several schemes launching in Europe this year, financial institutions have a lot of decisions to make and their work cut out to be ready in time. “A recent survey by ACI shows that consumers globally increasingly expect new and innovative services from banking providers, including real-time payments. Our message is to ‘act now’ and reap the benefits of the ‘first mover advantage.’ “ACI offers payment service providers the opportunity to ‘real-time-enable’ their payments platform now and add connectivity to any instant scheme as they become available. We not only provide our customers with a technical solution, but also payment processing functionality, guidance on compliance, fraud, scheme rules, testing and certification, as well as support throughout the complex on-boarding process.” ACI has an unmatched global customer base of financial institutions and payment service providers using its UP Real-Time Payments solution.

ACIW,"NAPLES, Fla., Jan 15, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Onlinefraud attempts and general retail transaction volumes increased substantially during the 2017 holiday season,according to new benchmark data from ACI Worldwide ACIW, +0.81% Fraud attempts in the period from Thanksgiving Day to December 31 increased by 22 percent, while the number of overall transactions increased by 19 percent. ACI’s benchmark survey data* is based on hundreds of millions of eCommerce retail transactions from global merchants using ACI ReD Shield—the eCommerce fraud prevention component of ACI’s UP portfolio of payment solutions—to detect and prevent CNP fraud during the 2016 and 2017 holiday shopping seasons (beginning Thanksgiving Day and ending on December 31). ACI ReD Shield processed 14 percent of all Thanksgiving Day online spend, 13 percent of all Black Friday online spend and 9 percent of all Cyber Monday online spend. Principal findings and key fraud activity trends include: Between Thanksgiving Day and December 31, 2017, the number of eCommerce transactions grew by 19 percent, compared to the same dates in 2016. Fraud attempts increased by 22 percent. Fraud attempt rates were highest on Thanksgiving Day (1.94 percent, up from 1.26 percent in 2016), Christmas Eve (1.78 percent, up from 1.48 percent) and December 21 – the cutoff date for express shipments – (1.67 percent, up from 1.49 percent). The trends driving these peak fraudulent days include shipment cut-off, consumer traffic and buy online pick-up in-store transactions. The average ticket price of attempted fraud transactions over the entire holiday period in 2017 was $227, a one percent increase from 2016 ($239). Reduced shipment prices, low-priced electronics and promotions are driving this trend. The overall volume of purchases recorded in January-October 2017 increased by 14 percent, compared to the same period in 2016. “Over the 2017 holiday shopping season, merchants experienced significant growth in their digital channels, coupled with a substantial increase in fraud,” said Erika Dietrich, Director of Risk Management, ACI Worldwide. “The consistent, alarming uptick in fraudulent activity on key dates is a signal that merchants must be proactive in their efforts to identify weak points across the omni-channel payment process—and define the short- and long-term strategies necessary to improve security and enhance customer experience.” During the 2017 holiday shopping season, the number of fraud attempts based on total population increased compared to the same time in 2016: In 2017, 1 out of every 85 transactions was a fraudulent attempt In 2016, 1 out of every 97 transactions was a fraudulent attempt In 2015, 1 out of every 109 transactions was a fraudulent attempt Key shopping dates by volume: Overall Thanksgiving Day eCommerce spend totaled $2.87 billion for an 18.3 percent year-over-year transaction volume growth (source: Adobe) Overall Black Friday spend totaled $5.03 billion for a 16.9 percent year-over-year transaction volume growth (source: Adobe) ACI will showcase its flexible, vendor-agnostic omni-channel merchant payments solutions at the NRF Annual Convention & Expo, January 14-16, 2018, in New York City, including its Mobile Commerce Software Development Kit (mSDK), and the adaptive machine learning capabilities of its merchant fraud prevention solution.
