ABAX,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) — It’s beginning to look as if it might be time to make a big bet on small-company growth stocks. Yes, the economy is starting to show signs of improvement and, as most investors know, that’s usually a good time to consider overweighting one’s portfolio with stocks likely to benefit the most from an expansion. To be sure, small-company growth stocks are already on the rise. In fact, small company growth stocks are already fifth-best performing fund category among domestic stocks funds this year, rising nearly 12% through Feb. 3, according to Morningstar. INVESTING COMMENTARY IN TRADING DECK Back to 1987 for stocks? Our Trading Deck has been home to a spirited debate over whether we're in for a crash. • L.A. Little: Don't worry | Michael Gayed: Worry • The warning signs of a 1987-style crash • Hulbert: Stocks as overvalued as at 2007 high But analysts say it’s not too late to take advantage of what could be a long-term investment trend. “The macroeconomic trends are going the right way, and generally higher beta stocks, small-company growth stocks, do well when macro-economic conditions improve,” said Janet Yang, a CFA charterholder and analyst with Morningstar. Plus, if you are a reversion-to-the mean investor, this could be a good time to be in small company growth stocks whether or not the economy is expanding. But which growth stocks or funds? According to Yang, there are at least two that carry Morningstar’s gold rating worth considering: The Morgan Stanley Focus Growth fund AMOAX which is a “high-conviction” version of its large-cap sibling, the Morgan Stanley Institutional Growth fund MSEQX, +1.71%  , and the Brown Capital Management Small Company Institutional fund BCSSX, +1.59%  . The Morgan Stanley Focus Growth fund, which is managed by a team led by Dennis Lynch, tends to invest in established brand-name companies with a competitive advantage as well as firms that offer hard-to-replicate products and services, Yang said. For example, many of the top 10 holdings in the $1 billion in assets fund were household names such as Amazon.com AMZN, +1.11% Apple AAPL, +0.78% Google GOOG, +2.71% Mead Johnson Nutrition Co. MJN and Monsanto Co. MON, -0.05%  But the fund also holds some non-household names as well, including Baidu Inc. BIDU, +0.04% Motorola Solutions Inc. MSI, +1.29%  Brookfield Asset Management Inc. BAM, +0.59%  , Intuitive Surgical Inc. ISRG, +2.59%   and Edenred EDNMF, +1.09%  And last but not least, the fund was holding some non-publicly traded securities, including Facebook, Inc. Class B. So far this year, the fund is up more than 11% — about four percentage points better than Russell 1000 Growth index, which tracks large-cap growth stocks, and on par with the Russell 2000 Growth index, the small-cap growth index. A word of caution: Investing in this fund isn’t for everyone. Investing in this fund could be a bit like riding a roller coaster: In 2008, the fund fell 53% and then rose 73% in 2009. Meanwhile, managers of the Brown Capital Management Small Company Growth fund BCSIX, +1.60% which is up more than 12% year-to-date, tend to invest in high quality vs. high-flyer stocks. Plus, the fund’s management team, which is led by Keith Lee, tends to take a long-term view of the stocks they hold, as evidenced by the fund’s low turnover ratio. The category’s average is about 85% while this fund’s turnover ratio is just 7%. According to Yang, the portfolio management team looks for firms with annual revenues of $250 million or less. And that mandate largely points the managers toward micro-cap stocks, according to her report on the fund. To wit: CARBO Ceramics Inc. CRR, -0.28%  Abaxis Inc. ABAX, +2.93% Diodes Inc. DIOD, +0.00%  Balchem Corp. BCPC, +0.57% Gen-Probe Inc. GPRO, -1.03% Blackbaud Inc. BLKB, +3.16% Tyler Technologies Inc. TYL, +2.27% FEI Co. FEIC  and Cognex Corp. CGNX, +2.40% were among the fund’s top 10 holdings as of Dec. 31, 2011. Meanwhile, Kevin W. Gamble, a CFA charterholder who manages a small-cap equity portfolio for the Retirement Systems of Alabama, says it would be wise to exercise “some caution” toward the small-cap growth group, especially after a four-month rally in the equity market. “That being said, the mergers and acquisitions backdrop has never been better for selected small-cap growth stocks in the technology space in particular, as many large-cap technology companies continue to struggle with a lack of organic growth, can borrow easily at historically low levels of interest, have excess cash on their balance sheets and are currently building upon this excess cash every quarter,” said Gamble, who is also immediate past president of the CFA Society of Alabama. “Many are hesitant to admit they are mature companies and thus don’t want to pay out a higher level of dividend yield, so the logical conclusion is that mergers and acquisitions will pick up in a big way as we move through 2012.” According to Gamble many potential targets include Taleo Corp. TLEO  , Sourcefire Inc. FIRE, +4.76% Fortinet Inc. FTNT, +2.49%  SolarWinds Inc. SWI, +0.24% Quest Software Inc. QSFT TIBCO Software Inc. TIBX MicroStrategy Inc. MSTR, +1.01% Qlik Technologies Inc. QLIK  , Constant Contact Inc. CTCT and Informatica Corp. INFA, -1.85%  . “We see a basket of these small-cap technology acquisition targets as having a positive risk/reward from current levels given the potential reward to shareholders from a pickup in acquisition activity,” Gamble said. Others agree that it’s too soon to bet big on small caps, but they do note that there are pockets of opportunity. For the American auto industry, we are seeing increased unit volumes which would benefit the OEMs, but on the small-cap side should also help the suppliers,” said Jeff Tryka, a CFA charterholder and director of financial communications with Lambert, Edwards & Associates. One company being American Axle AXL, +2.63%   “Similarly, with increased new model introductions and renewed focus on quality, small companies such as Perceptron Inc. PRCP, +2.82% stand to benefit from line changes and new production technology,” he said. In banking, Tryka said there are many small cap community banks, such as Mercantile Bank Corp. MBWM, -2.49%  that have spent several years working to remake their businesses with renewed focus on community lending that would stand to benefit from a revitalization of consumers in a growing recovery. Tryka also said retail apparel and footwear companies such as Wolverine Worldwide Inc. WWW, +0.10%  may benefit from improving demand as consumers turn more bullish and begin to open their wallets. Of course, there are those who have an entirely different view of whether to invest in small-cap growth stocks now. “We are encouraged by clear improvement in the U.S. economy and by small business lending growth, which we believe will benefit small cap growth stocks,” said Matthew Harrison, a CFA charterholder, certified investment management analyst, and chief investment officer of RMH Investment Management in Tucson. “However, we believe structural headwinds to economic growth remain, including no longer declining interest rates, higher tax rates and demographic headwinds — or, in other words, deleveraging and addressing the U.S. budget.” In addition, Harrison expressed concern about possible exogenous event risk, specifically, in Israel and Iran. “Weighing these factors, we are not adding to small-cap growth stocks at this stage and find more comfort in blue chip U.S., large-cap developed international and emerging market equities — all of which, we see as relatively attractive today.” That may be true. But it still might be worth going from underweight to overweight on small cap stocks — if the economy is truly expanding and if as Gamble said, M&As are on the horizon.

ABAX,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Made it -- briefly. But investment letter reaction to Dow 10,000 is very mixed. Writing early Tuesday, superbear Richard Russell of Dow Theory Letters seemed to dismiss the whole subject: ""For instance, every bull and every stockholder wants the Dow to close over 10,000. Why? Well, because 10,000 means and certainly feels like progress. A Dow over 10,000 just feels bullish, and why argue with that."" Russell has been treating the rally with respect. But after the close, he wrote: ""TODAY'S MARKET ACTION -- Not good. The Dow gave us a key reversal -- new high and then closing lower on rising volume... It's a bit early to jump to conclusions, but I haven't liked the market action the last few days. There's been an amazing amount of complacency, along with gathering optimism. The Transport's lack of confirmation [See my Dec. 8 column] has been completely ignored, and as has been the lack of volume on the most recent rise."" Peter Eliades of Stock Market Cycles put out a comment not unreasonably congratulating himselves (Eliades favors the Royal Plural): ""In the Barron's issue dated March 22nd, 1999, we wrote an article which they entitled ""Nasty Numbers."" The subtitle was ""Will the curse of Dow 100 and 1000 be revisited on 10,000?""...The first two sentences of the article proclaimed: ""So the Dow finally, if briefly, touched 10,000 last week. Investors should celebrate now, because they may not get another chance to do so for a decade or more."" In three more months, it will have been 4 years since that article was written and despite the ridicule that we had to face at the time the article was written, it looks more and more like the article could prove to have been quite prescient..."" Eliades says his esoteric numerological ""price projection technique"" now makes him think the Dow will probably be unsuccessful in overcoming 10,000. Tuesday night, he noted in his hotline that his ""Stock-index futures traders"" should now be shorting S&P futures as of the moment the Dow breached 10,000. He added: ""Exit that position tomorrow only if the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves above an intraday print of 10,040."" But the bulls are not impressed by the reversal. Todd Market Forecast said: ""There is currently a split market. The Nasdaq has essentially been retreating for the six sessions since the peak on Dec. 1st while the Dow has been going higher. The S&P has been sideways to down. The Nasdaq could be telling us something, but we doubt it."" Todd is currently buying stocks and bonds, neutral on gold. The Cabot Market Letter interests me particularly because it is one of the ""geezers"" - my name for letters that were around at the last bear market climax in 1974. It has been bullish for more than a year. In Tuesday night's hotline, Cabot contrasted the jubilant atmosphere when the Dow DJIA, +1.07% first exceed 10,000 with today's restraint and wrote: ""In general, we see the lack of out-and-out enthusiasm as a positive sign for the market over the longer-term. So you should remain bullish, though you shouldn't hesitate to ditch a stock if it's showing clear signs of weakness."" As of last night, Cabot recommended these buys: John B.

Business Overview Abaxis, Inc. is a worldwide developer, manufacturer and marketer of portable blood analysis systems that are used in a broad range of medical specialties in human or veterinary patient care to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements. Until March 2015, Abaxis also provided veterinary reference laboratory diagnostic and consulting services for veterinarians through AVRL. See the section below entitled ""Discontinued Operations"" for further information. Our corporate headquarters are located in Union City, California, from which we conduct our manufacturing, warehousing, research and development, regulatory, sales and marketing and administrative activities. We market and sell our products worldwide primarily through independent distributors, supplemented by our direct sales force. Our sales force is primarily located in the United States. Abaxis Europe GmbH, our wholly-owned subsidiary, markets and distributes diagnostic systems for medical and veterinary uses in the European and Asia Pacific markets. We manage our business in two operating segments, the medical market and veterinary market, as described below. See ""Segment Results"" in this section for a detailed discussion of financial results. Medical Market. We serve a worldwide customer group in the medical market consisting of physicians' office practices across multiple specialties, urgent care, outpatient and walk-in clinics (free-standing or hospital-connected), health screening operations, home care providers (national, regional or local), nursing homes, ambulance companies, oncology treatment clinics, dialysis centers, pharmacies, hospital laboratories, military installations (ships, field hospitals and mobile care units), pharmaceutical clinical trials and cruise ship lines. For our products in the human medical market, we employ primarily independent distributors to market our products. Starting in January 2013, we transitioned the majority of our medical product sales to Abbott as our exclusive distributor in the medical market. Pursuant to our Exclusive Agreement with Abbott, or the Abbott Agreement, Abbott obtained the exclusive right to sell and distribute our Piccolo Xpress chemistry analyzers and associated consumables in the professionally-attended human healthcare market in the United States and China (including Hong Kong). Effective September 2013, we amended the Abbott Agreement to limit Abbott's territory under such agreement to the United States and effective April 2017, we amended the Abbott Agreement to include clinical research organization in Abbott's customer segment. Effective July 2017, we further amended the Abbott Agreement to outline certain pricing for qualifying customers of Abbott. Under the Abbott Agreement, we have certain responsibilities for providing technical support and warranty services to Abbott in support of its marketing and sales efforts. The initial term of the Abbott Agreement ended on December 31, 2017, and after the initial term, the Abbott Agreement renews automatically for successive one-year periods unless terminated by either party based upon a notice of non-renewal six months prior to the then-current expiration date. We will continue to sell and distribute these medical products outside of the market segments as to which Abbott has exclusive rights. Under our Abbott Agreement, we will continue to sell and distribute to Catapult Health LLC and specified customer segments in the United States, including pharmacy and retail store clinics, shopping malls and cruise ship lines. Table of Contents We depend on a number of distributors in North America that distribute our VetScan products. In the United States veterinary market segment, we also rely on various independent regional distributors. In September 2012, we entered into a distribution agreement with MWI to purchase, market and sell the full line of Abaxis veterinary products throughout the United States. In October 2014, we entered into distribution agreements with Henry Schein Animal Health (a division of Henry Schein, Inc.) and Patterson Companies, Inc. to sell the full line of Abaxis veterinary products throughout the United States. We depend on our distributors to assist us in promoting our VetScan products, and accordingly, if one or more of our distributors were to stop selling our products in the future, we may experience a temporary sharp decline or delay in our revenues until our customers identify another distributor or purchase products directly from us. In addition to selling through distributors, we also directly supply our VetScan products to large group purchasing organizations, hospital networks and other buying groups in the United States, such as Veterinary Centers of America (VCA), a veterinary hospital chain in North America. In May 2014, we entered into a product supply agreement with VCA to supply our VetScan chemistry analyzers and diagnostic reagent discs for placement at VCA's animal hospitals located in North America that operates more than 800 animal hospitals. In May 2014, we entered into a non-exclusive co-marketing agreement with VCA's Antech Diagnostic laboratory services to supply our VetScan chemistry analyzers in combination with Antech Diagnostic laboratory services as a diagnostic solution to serve veterinary practices throughout North America. In the third quarter of fiscal 2016, we also entered into a five-year supply agreement with Banfield Pet Hospital, an organization with more than 900 pet hospitals within the United States and Puerto Rico. Under our supply agreement, we will provide our VetScan hematology analyzers and associated consumables to all of Banfield's pet hospital locations, for which installation and training began in April 2016 and was completed at the end of September 2016. Discontinued Operations In March 2015, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Antech pursuant to which we sold substantially all of the assets of our AVRL business to Antech. The transaction closed on March 31, 2015. We determined that our AVRL business met the criteria to be classified as a discontinued operation, which required retrospective application to our historical operating results. Accordingly, we report the results of operations of this business in discontinued operations within the financial statements appearing in this report, as applicable. Unless otherwise noted, references to revenues and expenses in this report are to our revenues and expenses excluding those from AVRL operations. See Note 4 of the Notes to Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report for additional information. The total purchase price under the asset purchase agreement was $21.0 million in cash. We received $20.1 million in cash proceeds during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015 and we recognized a pre-tax gain of $12.3 million ($7.7 million after-tax) on sale of discontinued operations during fiscal 2015. Additionally, upon meeting certain conditions by the first anniversary of the closing date in March 2016, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $0.9 million ($0.6 million after-tax) on sale of discontinued operations during fiscal 2016. The pre-tax gain on this sale reflects the excess of the sum of the cash proceeds received over the costs incurred in connection with the sale of AVRL. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we recorded costs of $7.8 million related to cash payments for employee-related costs, including severance, contract termination and other associated costs. In connection with the transaction, we recorded disposal and an impairment charge on long-lived assets of $1.9 million during fiscal 2015. These items partially offset the cash proceeds that we received in accordance with the terms of the asset purchase agreement. Overview of Financial Results In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, total revenues were $59.7 million, an increase of 13% from last year's comparable quarter. The net increase in revenues was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from consumable sales, which were $45.5 million, an increase of 13% over last year's comparable quarter, primarily attributable to (a) an increase in revenues from medical reagent discs sold in North America and Europe, (b) an increase in revenues from veterinary reagent discs sold in North America and Europe and (c) an increase in revenues from VetScan rapid tests sold in North America, due to an increase in the unit sales of our VetScan Canine Pancreatic Lipase Rapid Test (launched in the first quarter of fiscal 2018), VetScan Canine Parvovirus Rapid Test and VetScan Feline Leukemia Virus Antigen-Feline Immunodeficiency Virus Antibody (""FeLV/FIV"") Rapid Test. Table of Contents Total operating expenses in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 were $23.6 million, an increase of $5.0 million, or 27%, compared to the same period last year, primarily attributable to (a) an increase in personnel costs, (b) an increase in research and development expenses related to new product development and (c) an increase in sales and marketing expenses to support our growth in both North America and in the international markets. Income from continuing operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 was $4.2 million, a decrease of $2.6 million, or 38%, compared to the same period last year, primarily attributable to an increase in operating expenses, as discussed above and an increase in the income tax provision during the three months ended December 31, 2017, as compared to the same period last year, primarily attributable to a one-time non-cash charge of $2.9 million due to a reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction of the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. Our diluted net income per share from continuing operations was $0.18 in the third quarter of fiscal 2018, compared to $0.30 for the same period last year. Diluted net income per share from continuing operations for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 includes the effect of the non-cash charge of $2.9 million in our income tax provision. Cash, cash equivalents and investments increased by $19.9 million during the nine months ended December 31, 2017 to a total of $185.0 million as of December 31, 2017. During the nine months ended December 31, 2017, operating cash flows were $37.2 million, an increase of $14.9 million, compared to $22.3 million for the same period last year, primarily attributable to higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities as of December 31, 2017. Key non-operating uses of cash during the nine months ended December 31, 2017 included payments of $2.5 million made for tax withholdings related to net share settlements of restricted stock units and payment of $10.0 million in cash dividends to shareholders. Factors that May Impact Future Performance Our industry is impacted by numerous competitive, regulatory and other significant factors. On December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, also known as the ""Tax Cuts and Jobs Act"" (the ""Tax Act""), was signed into law. Following the recent enactment of the Tax Act, we expect our effective income tax rate to decline by 200 to 300 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, excluding a one-time non-cash charge described in Note 17, ""Income Taxes."" We estimate our effective income tax rate in fiscal 2019 will be lower by 1,000 to 1,200 basis points compared to fiscal 2017. The actual impact of the Tax Act on our effective income tax rates may differ from the estimates due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by us. We anticipate subsequent regulations associated with the Tax Act will be forthcoming and will continue to analyze the tax legislation to determine the full effects of the new law on our consolidated financial statements. Our sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty, and may depend on a number of factors outside of our control. In particular, we are highly dependent upon the efforts and priorities of our distributors in promoting and creating a demand for our products and as such, we do not have full control over the marketing and sale of our products into these markets. Should these efforts be unsuccessful, or should we fail to maintain or effectively manage these relationships, our business, financial condition and results of operations are likely to be adversely affected. We generally operate with a limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received. Product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter. As a result, any shortfall in product sales during a quarter would negatively affect our results of operations and financial condition during that quarter. In addition, our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors. Our ability to increase our revenues and profitability will depend, in part, on our ability to increase the sales volumes of our products, to increase the sales performance of our independent distributors, and to successfully compete with our competitors. Abbott controls the marketing and sale of our primary medical products into most of the U.S. medical market and, accordingly, we are dependent upon the efforts and priorities of Abbott in promoting and creating a demand for such products in this market. Should these efforts be unsuccessful, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. For example, during fiscal 2014, we were adversely impacted by the timing of purchases of our medical products sold to Abbott as it integrated our products into its sales process and sold its inventory, and in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2017, we were similarly negatively impacted by a reduction of orders from Abbott as a result of excess instrument inventory. In the United States veterinary market, we rely on our national and independent regional distributors. We are also dependent upon the efforts and priorities of these distributors in promoting and creating a demand for our products and do not have full control over the marketing and sale of our products into these markets. Should these efforts be unsuccessful, or should we fail to maintain or effectively manage these relationships, our business, financial condition and results of operations are likely to be adversely affected. For example, during fiscal 2014, our strategy of increasing demand for our veterinary products through the expansion of our distribution partners, did not lead to the increased demand for our products in the veterinary clinics that we had anticipated resulting in excess channel inventory. The excess channel inventory was the result of our distributors not selling our products to end customers at the same rate as they were purchasing products from us. In response, we took additional steps to more closely monitor and manage channel inventory in an effort to normalize the veterinary product inventories at our distribution partners in the United States. In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we began selling through our distributors, Henry Schein Animal Health (a division of Henry Schein, Inc.) and Patterson Companies, Inc., and our revenues in future quarters may be impacted by the timing of purchases of our products sold by them as these distributors integrate our products into their sales process. We will continue to closely monitor and manage channel inventory at our distribution partners in the United States. Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES, ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS Our condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and pursuant to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an on-going basis, we evaluate our estimates and the sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in the assumptions used in making them. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. However, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates. We have identified the policies below as critical because they are not only important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations, but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown. Accordingly, actual results may differ materially from our estimates. The impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below. A more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017. Revenue Recognition. Our primary customers are distributors and direct customers in both the medical and veterinary markets. Revenues from product sales, net of estimated sales allowances, discounts and rebates, are recognized when (i) evidence of an arrangement exists, (ii) upon shipment of the products, (iii) the sales price is fixed or determinable and (iv) collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured. Rights of return are not provided. Amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or non-current deferred revenue liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition. We recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contract. Multiple Element Revenue Arrangements. Our sales arrangements may contain multiple element revenue arrangements in which a customer may purchase a combination of instruments, consumables or extended maintenance agreements. Additionally, we provide incentives in the form of free goods or extended maintenance agreements to customers in connection with the sale of our instruments. We participate in selling arrangements in the veterinary market that include multiple deliverables, such as instruments and consumables. Judgments as to the allocation of consideration from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement, and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical with respect to these arrangements. A multiple element arrangement includes the sale of one or more tangible product offerings with one or more associated services offerings, each of which are individually considered separate units of accounting. We allocate revenues to each element in a multiple element arrangement based upon the relative selling price of each deliverable. When applying the relative selling price method, we determine the selling price for each deliverable using vendor-specific objective evidence, or ""VSOE,"" of selling price, if it exists, or third-party evidence, ""TPE,"" of selling price. If neither VSOE nor TPE of selling price exist for a deliverable, we use our best estimate of selling price for that deliverable. Revenue allocated to each element is then recognized when all revenue recognition criteria are met for each element. Table of Contents Customer Programs. From time to time, we offer customer marketing and incentive programs. Our most significant customer programs are described as follows: Instrument Trade-In Programs. We periodically offer trade-in programs to customers for trading in an existing instrument to purchase a new instrument and we will either provide incentives in the form of free goods or reduce the sales price of the instrument. These incentives in the form of free goods are recorded based on the relative selling price method according to the policies described above. Instrument Rental Programs. We periodically offer programs to customers whereby certain instruments are made available to customers for rent or on an evaluation basis. These programs typically require customers to purchase a minimum quantity of consumables during a specified period for which we recognize revenue on the related consumables according to the policies described above. Depending on the program offered, customers may purchase the instrument during the rental or evaluation period. Proceeds from such sale are recorded as revenue according to the policies described above. Rental income, if any, is also recorded as revenue according to the policies described above. Lease Programs. Starting in fiscal 2016, we entered into sales contracts as the lessor of instruments under sales-type lease agreements with our customers. In the veterinary market, we may offer arrangements to end users for monthly payments of instruments and consumables purchases over a term of six years. Revenues related to multiple-element arrangements are allocated to lease and non-lease elements based on their relative selling prices as prescribed by our revenue recognition policies described above. Lease elements generally include one or multiple veterinary instruments, while non-lease elements generally include the consumables related to the leased instrument. We estimate the fair value of our leased products for the purposes of lease classification. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification, or ASC, Topic 840, ""Leases"", or ASC 840, we define the fair value of a leased product at lease inception as its normal . . .

Non-GAAP Financial Measure To supplement the financial statements presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), Abaxis uses the non-GAAP financial measure of non-GAAP diluted net income per share.  The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Abaxis defines non-GAAP diluted net income per share as net income per share on a diluted basis excluding from net income the one-time non-cash charge due to a reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the TCJA enacted on December 22, 2017.  Abaxis uses this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.  Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding Abaxis' performance and liquidity by excluding a one-time non-cash charge resulting from changes to tax laws, that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results or operating performance.  A reconciliation from GAAP net income and GAAP diluted net income per share to non-GAAP net income and non-GAAP diluted net income per share, respectively, has been provided in the financial statement tables included below in this press release.

ABAX,"UNION CITY, Calif., Jan. 22, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Abaxis, Inc. (nasdaqgs:ABAX), a global diagnostics company manufacturing point-of-care instruments and consumables for the medical and veterinary markets worldwide, today announced that the USDA, Center for Veterinary Biologics, approved its new VetScan FLEX4 Rapid Test for veterinary use. The FLEX4 is a 4-in-1 lateral flow test used for the qualitative detection of Heartworm antigen as well as antibodies for Lyme, Ehrlichia and Anaplasma in canine whole blood, serum, or plasma samples. The FLEX4 Rapid Test is the newest addition to the VetScan Rapid Test product family.  The VetScan FLEX4 Rapid Test offers improved shelf-life, ease-of-use, room temperature storage, and price when compared to competing products. Veterinary clinics and hospitals now have a 4-in-1 alternative for vector-borne disease testing on a single cassette.  As with all other VetScan Rapid Tests for infectious diseases, results can be easily read by the user within 8-10 minutes.  Abaxis plans to begin shipping FLEX4 Rapid Tests to its distributor network later this quarter and the FLEX4 should be available to U.S. veterinarians shortly thereafter. Craig Tockman, Vice President of Animal Health Sales and Marketing for North America of Abaxis, stated, ""As a veterinarian, it is always important to have the option to choose quality diagnostic products for our valued clients and their pets.  We believe the FLEX4 Rapid Test will benefit many practices and hospitals looking for a new alternative that is accurate, has longer shelf-life, is less expensive, and easier to use. In addition, our strategic distributor partners are excited about this product and are prepared to get this new rapid test into the veterinary marketplace."" Clint Severson, Chief Executive Officer of Abaxis, said, ""The USDA approval of the VetScan FLEX4 Rapid Test is an important achievement. It fully opens the door for Abaxis to successfully compete in this $100 million+ annual market. At Abaxis, we strive to be a leading innovator in the point-of-care diagnostics segment, and we believe the new FLEX4 Rapid Test, a 4-in-1 canine test, fits that mold. We pride ourselves on providing better, innovative solutions for our valued customers and we believe this is a significant win for our customers.  Now, veterinary practices and hospitals have a diagnostic option that embodies the standard of excellence for which Abaxis is known. We believe the FLEX4 Rapid Test provides a better diagnostic solution for the pet and its owner and the veterinary practice. We look forward to the opportunities ahead."" Along with the multiplex FLEX4 Rapid Test, Abaxis will continue to sell the single test platform currently available for Heartworm disease, Lyme disease, Ehrlichiosis, and Anaplasmosis.  Many veterinarians praise the flexibility of the single Rapid Test line because they can test based on disease prevalence in their region or use individual tests to verify treatment outcomes at the point-of-care.  With the addition of the FLEX4, the veterinarian now has increased flexibility to test infectious diseases according to their preference.

ABAX,"UNION CITY, Calif., Jan. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Abaxis, Inc. (nasdaqgs:ABAX), a global diagnostics company manufacturing point-of-care blood analysis instruments and consumables for the medical and veterinary markets worldwide, today reported preliminary financial results for the third fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017. Abaxis expects revenues in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2018 in a range of $59.0 million to $60.0 million, an increase of 12% to 14%, over last year's comparable quarter.  In addition, Abaxis expects operating income before income tax provision in the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2018 of $9.0 million to $10.0 million compared to $10.8 million in last year's third quarter.  Abaxis expects its gross margin for the third fiscal quarter of fiscal 2018 to be between 53.5% and 54.0%. Following the recently enacted Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (""TCJA"") on December 22, 2017, Abaxis expects its effective income tax rate to decline by 200 to 300 basis points in fiscal 2018 compared to fiscal 2017, excluding a one-time non-cash charge described below.  In the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Abaxis expects its effective income tax rate to be approximately 27%, excluding a one-time non-cash charge described below.  Abaxis estimates its effective income tax rate in fiscal 2019 will be lower by 1,000 to 1,200 basis points compared to fiscal 2017.  During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, Abaxis expects to record a one-time non-cash charge of approximately $2.5 million to $3.5 million to its income statement as a result of TCJA.  The charge is due to a reduction in deferred tax assets as a result of the reduction of the federal tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018.  The actual impact of the TCJA on the Company's effective income tax rates may differ from the estimates above, due to changes in interpretations and assumptions made by the Company.  The Company anticipates subsequent regulations associated with the TCJA will be forthcoming and will continue to analyze the tax legislation to determine the full effects of the new law on Abaxis' financial statements. These estimated results for the third quarter of fiscal 2018 are preliminary and subject to change upon completion of Abaxis' quarter-end financial review process.  Abaxis plans to announce its detailed earnings results on January 25, 2018.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the financial statements presented in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Abaxis uses the non-GAAP financial measures of non-GAAP diluted net income per share.  The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP.  Abaxis defines non-GAAP diluted net income per share as net income per share on a diluted basis excluding from net income the recognized gain from the sale of an equity method investment and related costs, including the portion of our income tax provision associated with such gain.  Abaxis uses this non-GAAP financial measure for financial and operational decision making and as a means to evaluate period-to-period comparisons.  Management believes that this non-GAAP financial measure provides meaningful supplemental information regarding Abaxis' performance and liquidity by excluding certain income, such as gain from sale of an equity method investment and related costs, that may not be indicative of recurring core business operating results or operating performance.
