AAON,"ANNANDALE, Va. (MarketWatch) -- One of the noteworthy casualties of the recent bear market is a newsletter that focuses on companies involved in repurchasing their shares in the open market. But we should not count the letter out, by any means. That at least is the conclusion I drew from a recent interview with one of the finance professors who co-authored the first major study into companies involved in repurchase programs. He said that recent experience -- disappointing as it may be -- doesn't begin to cancel out the prior history in which the average buyback company significantly outperformed the market. The newsletter in question is called The Buyback Letter, edited by David Fried. Over the five years through the October 2007 stock market top, this newsletter's portfolios produced an average annualized return of 19.0%, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest. That was good enough to put the newsletter in 21st place for risk-adjusted performance over this period among the 123 newsletters for which the Hulbert Financial Digest had data. But the bear market over the last 18 months has not spared this newsletter. Its portfolios on average lost 48.9% from November 2007 through February of this year. This near halving of its model portfolios is not the only reason that some may question the relevance of the prior period's stellar returns. Repurchase activity itself has considerably dried up. Companies in the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.38% for example, spent just $48.1 billion on buybacks during the fourth quarter of 2008, vs. $141.7 billion in the year-earlier quarter. David Ikenberry, a finance professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, is a co-author of the seminal academic study of buybacks, entitled ""Market Underreaction to Open Market Share Repurchases."" It appeared in 1995 in the Journal of Financial Economics. In a recent interview, Ikenberry focused on the so-called repurchase effect that his study documented. He summarized the effect as holding that, other things being equal, a company that is repurchasing its shares will tend to outperform the market. But, he stressed, things have most definitely not been equal over the last 18 months, so it is hardly surprising that the repurchase effect has struggled as a stockpicking tool. Ikenberry urged us to remember that share repurchases are discretionary. We therefore would expect buyback programs to be scaled back during a recession, and especially when that recession is coupled with a credit crunch in which companies no longer can be assured of ready access to the capital markets. So even if corporate management were convinced that their share price represented an incredible bargain, they still may not be willing to spend any corporate cash to buy their shares in the open market. Ikenberry mentioned in this regard that some companies have been hoarding cash in recent months rather than spending it on any discretionary expenditures like share buybacks. He predicts that, once concern about access to capital markets begins to abate, much of the corporate cash hoard will find its way into repurchase programs. Ikenberry conceded that, because share repurchases are a relatively recent development in corporate America, we have no prior bear market to study to see what happened then to share repurchases. But he said he seriously doubts that the repurchase effect has stopped working altogether. Ikenberry did pass along one cautionary note, however: It's possible that some companies may be disingenuously announcing the creation of repurchase programs without intending to actually buy back any of their shares. The reason they would do this, of course, is in hopes of boosting their share price. Ikenberry said that, for this reason, investors may want to focus on companies that are actually repurchasing their shares rather than merely announcing that they intend to do so -- companies that his research has shown to perform even better than companies do after announcing share repurchases. The following are the stocks on Fried's March 2009 list of ""Buyback Hot List,"" which he describes as containing ""today's most compelling buyback stocks."" He stresses that at this point he is merely considering them for possible addition to his newsletter's model portfolios. AAON Inc AAON, +1.04% Alliance Data Systems Corp.

AAON,"BOSTON (CBS.MW) - Fidelity Investments's mutual fund managers were major buyers of large U.S. company stocks during the first quarter, documents filed with securities regulators Thursday show. The biggest U.S. mutual fund company was notably bullish on International Business Machines IBM, +0.60% and Amgen AMGN, +0.01% according to Fidelity Insight, a monthly newsletter that tracks the fund company. Fidelity Insight reviewed Fidelity's most recent 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, focusing on the top 25 companies ranked by market size in the Standard & Poor's 500 index as of March 31. Shareholdings as of the end of the first quarter were matched against Fidelity's reported totals at Dec. 31. Fidelity added 14.7 million shares to its Amgen stake in the first quarter, boosting its ownership in the biotechnology giant by 65 percent over fourth-quarter 2002 holdings, Fidelity Insight said in a release. Additionally, Fidelity fund managers bought 13 million more shares of IBM in the quarter, an increase of 61 percent over their fourth-quarter holding in the computer-industry bellwether. Fidelity's plate also includes 51.7 million more shares of AOL Time Warner AOL a 24 percent increase since the end of last year, and 35 million new shares of General Electric Co. GE, -1.46% a 12 percent increase over the same period. The fund company also was a net buyer in the first quarter of Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.55% Pfizer PFE, +0.54% SBC Communications SBC, -0.65% Verizon Communications VZ, -0.37% and Microsoft MSFT, +2.10% among others. ""They're definitely seeing some opportunities out there,"" John Bonnanzio, Fidelity Insight's editor, said of the fund family's trading activity. But he added that managers are being ""very discriminating about what they're buying and selling."" For example, although Fidelity was a buyer of SBC and Verizon, its managers sold 24 million shares of rival BellSouth Corp. BLS, +0.00% trimming the funds' stake in the telecom by 23 percent, Fidelity Insight's analysis shows. Although Fidelity portfolios still own 82.5 million BellSouth shares, ""someone's gone negative on it,"" Bonnanzio said, adding that such selective activity in fact is a positive sign. ""When you see Fidelity buying in one area of the market and selling another name, that suggests the analysts and managers are doing their homework,"" he explained. Fidelity also dumped 25.2 million shares of Altria Group MO, -0.21% in the first quarter, the filing indicated, reducing its stake in the tobacco and food giant by 23 percent to 82.9 million shares. A big footprint The latest 13-F shows that Fidelity's various investment divisions owned more than 7,000 stocks worldwide with a market value of roughly $375 billion as of March 31. The stakes encompassed a wide-range of sectors and companies from Aaon AAON, +1.04% a heating and cooling equipment maker, to Zymogenetics ZGEN a biotech firm. The 13-F, which all investment managers of a certain size are required to file with the SEC, is only a snapshot of holdings as of a specific date and may not reflect current positions. Fidelity leaves a huge footprint on any market, to be sure, and by default many of the stocks it buys will be among the top 25 companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. But the trading comes at a time when weary investors haven't been giving Fidelity and most other fund companies as much money to invest in stocks. An estimated $2.6 billion in net new cash flowed into Fidelity funds in the first three months of this year, according to Financial Research Corp., an investment research firm. By comparison, Fidelity took in about $3.3 billion in March 2002 alone. Managers of several key Fidelity funds put new money to work in the first quarter, company data shows. Magellan FMAGX, +1.58% manager Bob Stansky modestly reduced his fund's cash position to 3.8 percent of assets from 4.4 percent. Contrafund FCNTX, +1.75% manager Will Danoff took cash down to 5.6 percent from 9.2 percent, while John Avery, manager of Fidelity Fund FFIDX, +1.44% reduced cash to 2.4 percent from 6.3 percent during the period.

AAON,"LOS ANGELES (CBS.MW) -- Can America's children ever learn about saving, investing, money and personal finance basics if their teachers aren't setting an example? ""For every five years you put off investing, you may need to double your monthly investing amount to achieve the same retirement income."" Charles Schwab Retirement bombshell That's virtually what a large majority of Americans do when it come to planning and saving for a future retirement -- nothing. That's right. Only 35 percent of the population are saving enough to retire. And half of all Americans over 65 would be living in poverty if it weren't for their meager Social Security checks. Only a quarter of Americans own stocks. And another quarter believe the only way they will ever become a millionaires is with the lottery. This is scary stuff -- wake up! One of the 10 main rules in my new book, The Winning Portfolio, is auto-pilot savings. Why? Because a regular, disciplined savings plan is absolutely essential to building a millionaire's nestegg for almost all Americans. Here are the three secrets they're using to retire early. All very basic stuff: 1. They plan ahead, way ahead. The successful early retiree starts planning to do it back in their 20s and 30s. They are also extremely disciplined and frugal in their spending habits. They set goals, commit to them, make plans, get into action -- and nothing gets in the way. 2. They sacrifice during their working years. Most Americans have trouble saving 5 percent of their income. Early retirees often save 20, 30 even 50 percent or more. Obviously, they're not your typical consumers, because they are living way below their income, and often laughed at by the rest of consumer-oriented America. 3. They sacrifice after their working years. The successful early retiree also cuts back during retirement.Why? They know their savings will have to last them 25 years or more, and that demands long-term planning, through a few bull-bear cycles. ""Thinner thighs or a fatter portfolio, all you really need is self-discipline."" Jonathan Clements Wall Street Journal The ultimate secret -- auto-pilot savings Waiting until tomorrow to start saving is like Russian roulette. Charles Schwab put it this way: ""For every five years you put off investing, you may need to double your monthly investing amount to achieve the same retirement income."" And Jonathan Clements used more descriptive and colloquial terms in The Wall Street Journal, ""Thinner thighs or a fatter portfolio, all you really need is self-discipline."" The longer you wait the more you must put aside to create a million dollar nestegg: Age You Start Annual Investment To Become Millionaire 20 $ 1,025 25 $ 1,720 30 $ 2,920 (only $250 a month!) 35 $ 5,000 40 $ 8,770 45 $ 15,600 (now, $1,300 a month) 50 $ 29,000 55 $ 60,000 (ouch, $5,000 each month!) 60 $ 161,000 So what is the #1 secret to successful investing? Asset allocations? Sure, they're important. How about picking a 'hot hand' of tech funds? No, not the #1 secret. It?s so easy to forget the #1 secret to successful investing. And without this one, you'll never meet any of your financial goals. Never? No, never! I call it ""auto-pilot savings."" Even the kids are getting the message today. John Brennan, Vanguard?s CEO told Forbes: ""People ask me who is the best investor I know, and I say Will Brennan, 14. He?s my son ... He has invested every month in a basket of equity funds, in good markets and bad, and he has made a fortune doing it. Why? Because he doesn?t look at the market every day, and he doesn?t react to news. He just invests regularly. The best investors are disciplined investors."" This is your wake-up call, America! What happened, America? Less than two decades ago we were saving over 8 percent. Now Americans are saving somewhere between 0ne and four percent. Not enough. You?ll need much, much more. ""Do you really need that big-screen TV or new suit? Today's workers who want a secure retirement have to start saying no."" U.S. News & World Report Save your way to a million Here?s the facts straight from the highly-respected Investors Business Daily newspaper: ""Think you?ll never have a million dollars? It?s easier to obtain than you might think ? if you?re young and patient. Thanks to the power of compounding, a 25-year-old needs to invest only $1,720 a year to reach seven figures by age 65. That assumes an 11 percent average annual return. A 45-year-old has to sock away $15,600 a year. For investors who start young, most of that $1 million is interest [and reinvested dividends]. By age 65, the 25-year-old has invested only $68,800 ? less than 10 percent of his ending balance.""

Double it and you'll retire early.Do not wait. Get on auto-pilot savings and you could almost throw darts at this list to pick the right funds. Unprepared teachers, unprepared kids Let's hope that the teachers that Kirk's wife asked about their retirement planning are not representative of America's teachers in general. She says most are doing nothing -- Nothing! If that's an indication of the entire profession, we're in trouble. If our teachers aren't preparing themselves for retirement, then America's kids aren't getting the fundamentals -- either through example or education. What to do? First, take care of yourself first. Make sure your own retirement planning house is in order. Second, make sure your kids are part of the process, and you are educating them on the basics of retirement planning, before they leave your home, even before they go to school. Be a responsible parent when it comes to money. And lastly, ask the tough questions in your school and PTA system -- are they teaching enough about personal finance and retirement planning? And the tough one -- are the teachers themselves ready for retirement? Or are they like Kirk's wife's colleagues? Doing nothing? Flunking the test. Because if they are, then your kids -- and America's next generation of leaders -- may flunk the test too. More from MarketWatch Can the Democrats Ride a Blue Wave to Midterm Election Wins?

AAON,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- If you have a hankering for some mouthwatering Texas barbeque or crave a lobster dinner from New England, here's some good news. You don't have to travel farther than your computer keyboard to enjoy these regional favorites, thanks to Web sites that deliver these and other goodies straight from the source to your door. New York Breakfast Lobster Feast Louisiana Gumbo Texas Barbeque Chicago Pizza California Cuisine CBS This Morning ordered six specialty meals, representing different regions of the United States, via the Internet. Michael and Jane Stern, food writers and authors of ""Eat Your Way Across the U.S.A,"" reviewed the meals for delivery time and cost, packaging, preparation time, price and, of course, taste -- how fresh, flavorful and authentic they tasted. New York Breakfast See the report From: H&H Bagels in New York City. One dozen assorted bagels with a choice of two cream cheeses and Nova Scotia salmon (lox). Serves four to six. Taste: It's a classic New York breakfast, authentic and fresh -- as close to hot as you can get for overnight shipping. Even the FedEx driver inquired about the wonderful smell, saying it was driving her crazy. Also, the proportion of cream cheese and lox to bagels was nearly perfect. Preparation: None. You only need a knife to cut the bagels and spread the cream cheese. Delivery: Overnight via FedEx, arriving between 9:30 a.m. and 10 a.m. Price: $34 plus $21 for shipping and handling, for a total cost of $55. Lobster Feast From: The Lobster Net Co. Two hard-shell Maine lobsters (1 1/4 - 1 1/2 lbs.), clam chowder, steamers, corn on the cob or Maine potatoes, with butter and lemon. Also includes pot, shell crackers, forks, bibs, and place mats. Serves two. Taste: This is a true Yankee shore dinner, so fresh they send live lobsters. It's like going to the seafood market. Preparation: Twenty to 30 minutes to cook. All you need to do is boil water. Includes exact and specific directions, even how to crack the shells. Delivery: Overnight. Must cook and eat the day of delivery. Price: At $96, this is expensive, but the cost includes shipping. It's crazy to spend the money if you live in New England. But if you live in the middle of Kansas, you might want to splurge. A similar service is offered by www.fultonstreet.com, which is unaffiliated with the Fulton Fish Market in New York City. Louisiana Cajun Treat From: Deanie's Seafood in Metairie, La. Seafood gumbo with marinated crab salad and marinated olive salad. Serves two. Taste: Very exotic Cajun/Creole cooking. This is something you can't get outside of southern Louisiana. It's so authentic that it might be more enjoyable for those already very familiar with this kind of cuisine. The olive salad is very strong and luscious, with a powerful garlic taste. The crab paws in the crab salad are bit hard to open, and no cracking utensils are included. Preparation: Heat the gumbo. Delivery: Overnight delivery via FedEx is extremely expensive. Also, leakage occurred from the plastic containers. Price: Shipping and handling cost almost three times as much as the food. The meal was $21 plus $59 shipping, for a total cost of $80. Texas Barbeque From: New Braunfels Smokehouse of New Braunfels, Texas. The site's Texas Fixin's meal includes smoked beef brisket, four pork and beef sausages, two sides of baby back ribs, and barbecue sauce. Serves six. Preparation: Fully cooked, vacuum packed and shipped frozen -- but usually the meat arrives thawed. If there's no defrosting required, just heat up. Delivery: Two days via UPS, or overnight. (It did not arrive for a scheduled Tuesday delivery.) Price: $37 plus $7, for a total cost of $42. Authentic Chicago Deep-Dish Pizza From: Edwardo's of Chicago, Ill. Nine-inch stuffed spinach pizza. Serves two. Taste: It has a creamy richness unlike flat pizzas. Franchises or chains have tried to recreate this pizza, without getting the Chicago character. And don't let the small size deceive you; it's very rich and substantial. Preparation: Heat frozen pizza for 40 to 45 minutes. (Fortunately pizza freezes well.) Delivery: Two- to three-day standard delivery or overnight. Price: $20 plus $15 for shipping, for a total of $35. Contemporary California Cuisine From: Cook Express of San Francisco, Calif. Offers five different meal-kit entrees such as Asian salmon, filet mignon, mustard-glazed chicken, pan-roasted halibut, and roasted duck. The menu changes every month. Serves two and up. Taste: Ready-to-go, delicious, sophisticated meals that you would expect to get at a high-priced restaurant. Includes sauces and garnishes. (Steak and halibut were the ones we ordered.) Preparation: This is cooking for dummies. All the hard work has already been done as if you had your own prep chef. It takes 30 minutes to cook and heat up. Assumes nothing and includes very detailed instructions. Delivery: Overnight via FedEx. Orders are taken Monday through Thursday by 12 p.m. EST for next-day delivery. Includes a time/temperature gauge to ensure your meal kit is safe to cook and eat. Price: Very reasonable. Entrees for two run $19 to $30 plus $12.95 for shipping. The average entree for two costs $25 plus $13, for a total of $38.

AAON,"NORTH PALM BEACH, Fla. (bankrate.com) -- An open spot in the den that's just right for a computer. A garage workshop where that craft everyone admires can be turned into cash. It's a popular dream these days: a business of your own under a roof you are already paying for. ""You're paying your mortgage or rent anyway, so you're getting free overhead and a tax deduction."" Robert Spiegel, author and entrepreneur The availability of technology, and the growth in popularity of home businesses, puts those goals within reach of an increasing number of people. While estimates vary on how many people have started home businesses, most agree that home-based entrepreneurs represent the fastest-growing segment of business today, growing about 10 percent annually. By next year, close to 19 million Americans will work in home-based businesses, according to the National Association of Home-Based Businesses. The financial comforts of home ""The financial issues are overwhelmingly in favor of home business,"" says Robert Spiegel, entrepreneur and author of ""Home Business Magazine's Complete Guide to Home Business,"" due out this fall. ""You're paying your mortgage or rent anyway, so you're getting free overhead and a tax deduction."" Home office costs Computer: As little as $600 Computer printer: At least $200 Computer printer with fax and copier capabilities: $400 and up Business cards: As little as $15, more with logo or special type Desk: As little as $100 -- can be less if you assemble it Computer armoire: At least $400 Desk chair: As little as $40, but you'll probably pay at least $90 to $120 to get one in which you can sit for long periods of time. How much money does it take to start a business at home? That depends on the type of business and where you shop -- superstores are a good place to start. If you're setting up a service business that doesn't require heavy supplies or equipment, you can be up and running for as little as $1,000 - $2,000 for a computer and printer, business cards, letterhead and licenses. Careful shopping may produce a desk for $100 or less. Different home and family situations require additional expenses -- perhaps for a separate phone line, fax, or answering machine or service. The most important investment for most home-based businesses is the computer. With many models retailing for well under $1,000, a PC can pay for itself quickly by saving the cost of hiring clerical help. For example, hiring a bookkeeper might cost you $15 an hour, or $100 a day. If you can master bookkeeping software -- which will set you back from $40 for a simple program to more than of $300 for a more complex package -- you can save the salary expenses until your work is more demanding, and profitable, and you need outside help. At these prices, saving the cost of 13 days of the bookkeeper's time pays for the $1,000 computer and $300 in software. Tax benefits of home work ""In order to make it tax-deductible, you must have a separate space."" Martin Zients, Florida Atlantic University Home office deductions also increase the allure of setting up a home-based business. A percentage of the mortgage and home expenses for the part of the home used solely and exclusively for the business can be deducted. For example, if you're running your business from a 100-square foot bedroom in a 2,000-square foot home, you are using 5 percent of the home's total floor space for the business and may be able to deduct 5 percent of the mortgage interest or rent and household expenses. There are strict rules that govern what qualifies for a home-office tax deduction. Spiegel works in a corner of the family room that's ""off-limits"" to everything else and deducts a piece of his mortgage as a home-office deduction. On the other hand, Martin Zients of the Small Business Development Center at Florida Atlantic University's College of Business in Boca Raton, Fla., advises people against commandeering the family computer and setting up shop in the middle of the den. ""In order to make it tax-deductible, you must have a separate space,"" he says. A tax professional should assist with the decision whether to deduct for a portion of the living room, or a home office with a door. But having a business at home may be ideal for someone who wants to check out a business idea without investing too much cash. So is this truly for you? Is that part-time hobby something that can translate into a money-making endeavor? Should the commute and the job be abandoned to work in the comfort of home, close to the kids and the schools -- and the dirty laundry and the refrigerator? Experts and veterans say that, among the dozens of issues any startup business faces, there are a handful of factors that help determine whether a home will be the right site for your dream business. What will the neighbors think? Is it practical - and legal - to start a business in the home? That depends on what is intended. Is there enough room in the apartment to store the needed supplies? If the home is in a quiet, residential neighborhood, will the business draw added foot or car traffic, produce unpleasant smells or noise to offend the guy next door? Or is the work invisible, inaudible and inoffensive to all who live on the block? ""If you're going to do bookkeeping, it's one thing,"" Zients says. ""If you're going to do furniture refinishing, it's another."" Zients has found that most service businesses are invisible, and therefore not a problem. And the tide of home-based businesses has led many suburban communities to reconsider laws on the books that were once highly restrictive of home-based endeavors. ""If you have a quiet business, most neighbors approve, because someone's home in the neighborhood,"" Spiegel says. Still, in the name of protecting property values and neighborhood aesthetics, some municipalities restrict the type of businesses that can be operated out of a home, and limit the number of employees or customers that are allowed to come through the door. Before making the leap, make a call or visit to the city's zoning board. It will have the answers to the legality of opening a home-based business. And experts caution that, while some people open businesses in their homes in spite of the laws, it's an especially bad idea if any aspect of the business will offend the neighbors in any way. No time for children One of the primary appeals of starting a home-based business is the ability to keep an eye on the children while minding the store. But it's wise to go into the arrangement with realistic expectations. While people are becoming accustomed to home-based businesses and the interruptions they generate, it's still important to remain professional. Someone trying to discipline the kids while speaking to customers may not be portraying the desirable image. Many home-based business owners teach their children when they can or cannot be interrupted, complete with a ""do not disturb"" sign. Even more likely than children interrupting a business, is a business that interrupts a family, says Spiegel, who works at home with three school-age children. ""During the first 6 to 12 months (of a home-based business), it's, 'I'm done with dinner, I'm going to check my e-mail,' and you don't see the person for the next four hours,"" Spiegel says. ""The entrepreneur who's anxious to make sure the business is successful has a hard time stepping away from work.""","July 15, 1999 10:35 a.m. ET",1,Small Business: Working at home can save cash flow,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/small-business-working-at-home-can-save-cash-flow

AAON,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We engineer, manufacture, market and sell air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of standard, semi-custom and custom rooftop units, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps and coils. These products are marketed and sold to retail, manufacturing, educational, lodging, supermarket, medical and other commercial industries. We market our products to all 50 states in the United States and certain provinces in Canada. Our business can be affected by a number of economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. The recent uncertainty of the economy has negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets. A further decline in economic activity could result in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability. Sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate closely to the number of new homes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, consumer spending habits, employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. We sell our products to property owners and contractors through a network of manufacturers' representatives and our internal sales force. The demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors. The commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts, but has a lag factor of six to 18 months. Housing starts, in turn, are affected by such factors as interest rates, the state of the economy, population growth and the relative age of the population. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market. The new construction market in 2017 continued to be unpredictable and uneven. Thus, throughout the year, we emphasized promotion of the benefits of AAON equipment to property owners in the replacement market. The principal components of cost of goods sold are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight out and engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum and are obtained from domestic suppliers. We also purchase from domestic manufacturers certain components, including compressors, motors and electrical controls. The price levels of our raw materials fluctuate given that the market continues to be volatile and unpredictable as a result of the uncertainty related to the U.S. economy and global economy. For the year ended December 31, 2017, the prices for copper, galvanized steel and stainless steel increased approximately 6.2%, 15.8% and 4.4%, respectively, from a year ago, while the price for aluminum remained relatively unchanged from a year ago. For the year ended December 31, 2016, the prices for copper, galvanized steel and stainless steel decreased approximately 4.8%, 9.5%, and 12.3%, respectively, from 2015, while the price for aluminum increased 0.0% from 2015. We attempt to limit the impact of price fluctuations on these materials by entering into cancellable and non-cancellable fixed price contracts with our major suppliers for periods of six to 18 months. We expect to receive delivery of raw materials from our fixed price contracts for use in our manufacturing operations. The following are highlights of our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition: We spent $41.7 million in capital expenditures in 2017, an increase of $15.1 million from the $26.6 million spent in 2016, primarily due to construction projects related to our new research and development lab, water-source heat pump production line, as well as other internal development projects. We paid cash dividends of $13.7 million in 2017 compared to $12.7 million in 2016. We experienced increases in our warranty expense due to refinements and changes to our warranty process.

Income Taxes Years Ending December 31, Effective Tax Rate 2016 2015 2016 2015 (in thousands) Income tax provision $ 26,615 $ 25,611 33.3 % 35.9 %  The Company early adopted ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, applying the changes for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies prospectively. As a result, excess tax benefits and deficiencies are reported as an income tax benefit or expense on the statement of income rather than as a component of additional paid-in capital on the statement of equity. Excess tax benefits and deficiencies are treated as discrete items to the income tax provision in the reporting period in which they occur. For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, the Company recorded $2.1 million in excess tax benefits as an income tax benefit. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the occasional use of the revolving bank line of credit based on our current liquidity at the time. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased $2.7 million from December 31, 2016 to December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, we had $21.5 million in cash and cash equivalents. As of December 31, 2017, we had certificates of deposit of $2.9 million and investments held to maturity at amortized cost of $6.1 million. These certificates of deposit had maturity dates of one to five months. The investments held to maturity at amortized cost had maturity dates of one to four months. On July 25, 2016 we renewed our line of credit with BOKF, NA dba Bank of Oklahoma, formerly known as Bank of Oklahoma, N.A. (""Bank of Oklahoma""). The revolving line of credit matures on July 27, 2018. We expect to renew our line of credit in July 2018 with favorable terms. Under the line of credit, there was one standby letter of credit of $0.8 million as of December 31, 2017. At December 31, 2017 we have $29.2 million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility. No fees are associated with the unused portion of the committed amount. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no outstanding balances under the revolving credit facility. Interest on borrowings is payable monthly at LIBOR plus 2.5%. The weighted average interest rate was 3.5% and 3.0% for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility. We are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. These covenants require that we meet certain parameters related to our tangible net worth and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio. At December 31, 2017, our tangible net worth was $237.2 million, which meets the requirement of being at or above $125.0 million. Our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio was 0.3 to 1.0 which meets the requirement of not being above 2 to 1. The Board has authorized three stock repurchase programs for the Company. The Company may purchase shares on the open market from time to time, up to a total of 5.7 million shares. The Board must authorize the timing and amount of these purchases. Effective May 24, 2016, the Board authorized up to $25.0 million in open market repurchases and on June 2, 2016, the Company executed a repurchase agreement in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC allowing the Company to repurchase an aggregate amount of $25.0 million or a total of approximately 2.0 million shares from the open market. The repurchase agreement expired on April 15, 2017. The Company also has a stock repurchase arrangement by which employee-participants in our 401(k) savings and investment plan are entitled to have shares in AAON, Inc. stock in their accounts sold to the Company. The maximum number of shares to be repurchased is contingent upon the number of shares sold by employee-participants. Lastly, the Company repurchases shares of AAON, Inc. stock from certain of its directors and employees for payment of statutory tax withholdings on stock transactions. Any other repurchases from directors or employees are contingent upon Board approval. All repurchases are done at current market prices.

Our recent dividends are as follows: Declaration Date Record Date Payment Date Dividend per Share May 19, 2015 June 12, 2015 July 1, 2015 $ 0.11 October 29, 2015 December 2, 2015 December 23, 2015 $ 0.11 May 24, 2016 June 10, 2016 July 1, 2016 $ 0.11 November 9, 2016 December 2, 2016 December 23, 2016 $ 0.13 May 16, 2017 June 9, 2017 July 7, 2017 $ 0.13 November 7, 2017 November 30, 2017 December 21, 2017 $ 0.13 Based on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the projected cash flows generated from our operations, our existing committed revolving credit facility (or comparable financing) and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations in 2018 and the foreseeable future. Statement of Cash Flows The table below reflects a summary of our net cash flows provided by operating activities, net cash flows used in investing activities, and net cash flows used in financing activities for the years indicated. 2017 2016 2015 (in thousands) Operating Activities Net Income $ 54,498 $ 53,376 $ 45,728 Income statement adjustments, net 20,362 18,996 16,250 Changes in assets and liabilities: Accounts receivable (7,516 ) 7,048 (5,884 ) Income tax receivable 4,596 (1,537 ) 312 Inventories (23,698 ) (9,478 ) (1,059 ) Prepaid expenses and other 98 (83 ) 76 Accounts payable 3,043 654 (5,109 ) Deferred revenue 258 417 189 Accrued liabilities 6,353 (5,470 ) 4,852 Net cash provided by operating activities 57,994 63,923 55,355 Investing Activities Capital expenditures (41,713 ) (26,604 ) (20,967 ) Purchases of investments (18,521 ) (14,496 ) (20,863 ) Maturities of investments and proceeds from called investments 29,112 24,095 18,519 Other 70 80 117 Net cash used in investing activities (31,052 ) (16,925 ) (23,194 ) Financing Activities (Payments) borrowings under revolving credit facility, net - - - Stock options exercised 2,259 2,063 2,795 Repurchase of stock (16,620 ) (19,317 ) (36,558 ) Employee taxes paid by withholding shares (1,614 ) (823 ) (585 ) Cash dividends paid to stockholders (13,663 ) (12,676 ) (11,857 ) Net cash used in financing activities $ (29,638 ) $ (30,753 ) $ (46,205 )  Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flows from operating activities decreased primarily due to increased purchases of inventory during the year. Cash Flows from Investing Activities The capital expenditure program for 2018 is estimated to be approximately $53.2 million. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily due to construction projects related to our new research and development lab, water-source heat pump production lines, as well as other internal development projects. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at the discretion of our CEO and Board of Directors without incurring substantial charges. Cash Flows from Financing Activities Cash flows used in financing activities decreased slightly due to fewer open market buybacks following the expiration of the Company's repurchase agreement in April 2017. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We are not party to any off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues, expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Commitments and Contractual Agreements We had no material contractual purchase agreements as of December 31, 2017. Contingencies We are subject to various claims and legal actions that arise in the ordinary course of business. We closely monitor these claims and legal actions and frequently consult with our legal counsel to determine whether they may, when resolved, have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows and we accrue and/or disclose loss contingencies as appropriate. We have concluded that the likelihood is remote that the ultimate resolution of any pending litigation or claims will be material or have a material adverse effect on the Company's business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (""US GAAP"") requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events, and apply judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses in our consolidated financial statements and related notes. We base our estimates, assumptions and judgments on historical experience, current trends and other factors believed to be relevant at the time our consolidated financial statements are prepared. However, because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty, actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and such differences could be material. We believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates, assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Inventory Reserves - We establish a reserve for inventories based on the change in inventory requirements due to product line changes, the feasibility of using obsolete parts for upgraded part substitutions, the required parts needed for part supply sales, replacement parts and for estimated shrinkage. Warranty - A provision is made for estimated warranty costs at the time the product is shipped and revenue is recognized. The warranty period is: the earlier of one year from the date of first use or 18 months from date of shipment for parts only; an additional four years on compressors (if applicable); 15 years on aluminized steel gas-fired heat exchangers (if applicable); 25 years on stainless steel heat exchangers (if applicable); and 10 years on gas-fired heat exchangers in RL products (if applicable). With the introduction of the RQ product line in 2010, our warranty policy for the RQ series was implemented to cover parts for two years from date of unit shipment and labor for one year from date of unit shipment. Our warranty policy for the WH and WV Series geothermal/water-source heat pumps covers parts for five years from the date of manufacture. Warranty expense is estimated based on the warranty period, historical warranty trends and associated costs, and any known identifiable warranty issue. Due to the absence of warranty history on new products, an additional provision may be made for such products. Our estimated future warranty cost is subject to adjustment from time to time depending on changes in actual warranty trends and cost experience. Should actual claim rates differ from our estimates, revisions to the estimated product warranty liability would be required. Stock Compensation - We measure and recognize compensation expense for all share-based payment awards made to our employees and directors, including stock options and restricted stock awards, based on their fair values at the time of grant. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis during the service period of the related share-based compensation award. Forfeitures are accounted for as they occur. The fair value of each option award and restricted stock award is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. The use of the Black-Scholes-Merton option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions such as: the expected volatility, the expected term of the options granted, expected dividend yield, and the risk-free rate.

AAON,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in this report, and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. This discussion contains or incorporates by reference ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results, based on information available at the time this report is filed with the SEC or, with respect to any document incorporated by reference, available at the time that such document was prepared. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those identified in the section entitled ""Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the section entitled ""Risk Factors"" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. We do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, new information or circumstances or otherwise, except as required by law. Overview We engineer, manufacture and market air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of standard, semi-custom and custom rooftop units, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps and coils. These products are marketed and sold to retail, manufacturing, educational, lodging, supermarket, medical and other commercial industries. We market our products to all 50 states in the United States and certain provinces in Canada. Foreign sales were approximately $11.4 million of our total net sales for the nine months just ended and $11.1 million of our sales during the same period of 2016. Our business can be affected by a number of economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. The uncertainty of the economy has negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets. A further decline in economic activity could result in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability. Sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate closely to the number of new homes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, consumer spending habits, employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. We sell our products to property owners and contractors through a network of manufacturers' representatives and our internal sales force. The demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors. The commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts, but has a lag factor of six to 18 months. Housing starts, in turn, are affected by such factors as interest rates, the state of the economy, population growth and the relative age of the population. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market. The new construction market in 2016 through the third quarter of 2017 continued to be unpredictable and uneven. Thus, we continue to emphasize promotion of the benefits of AAON equipment to property owners in the replacement market. The principal components of cost of goods sold are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight and engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum, and are obtained from domestic suppliers. We also purchase from domestic manufacturers certain components, including compressors, motors and electrical controls. The price levels of our raw materials have remained relatively consistent the past few years, but the market continues to be volatile and unpredictable as a result of the uncertainty related to the U.S. economy and a weakening global economy. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the price for copper, galvanized steel, stainless steel and aluminum increased by approximately 2.7%, 13.5%, 2.6% and 1.8%, respectively, for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. In 2015, AAON initiated the design of a new Water Source Heat Pump product line and its affiliated manufacturing facility. We have brought the product into the marketplace and are in the final stages of completing this introduction into a $500-$600 million new market. In 2016, we began construction of a 162,000 square foot laboratory building with ten testing cells contained within it. This unique laboratory will have capabilities beyond anything known to exist in the world and will elevate AAON's research and design capabilities accordingly. Completion of this lab in 2018 will therefore be quite significant. - 15 - The following are recent highlights and items that impacted our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: Overall units sold increased approximately 7.7% as compared to the same period last year. We invested $26.4 million in capital expenditures in connection with the construction of our new research and development lab, water source heat pump line and other internal projects. Increased warranty costs due to modifications and refinements in our policy, which are expected to be short-term.

The Company has been working on modifications and refinements to its warranty policy. These modifications more clearly define what qualifies as a warranty claim and place a deadline for when claims may be submitted. This has increased our warranty reserve and increased our warranty expense for the three months ended September 30, 2017. - 17 - Income Taxes Three Months Ended September 30, Effective Tax Rate 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Income tax provision $ 8,033 $ 7,080 35.3 % 31.1 %  The Company's estimated annual 2017 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is expected to be approximately 36.0%. The rate is higher for the three months ended September 30, 2017 due to shifts in income to states with a higher tax rate and a smaller excess tax benefit from stock compensation.

The Company has been working on modifications and refinements to its warranty policy. These modifications more clearly define what qualifies as a warranty claim and place a deadline for when claims may be submitted. This has increased our warranty reserve and increased our warranty expense for nine months ended September 30, 2017. Income Taxes Nine Months Ended September 30, Effective Tax Rate 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Income tax provision $ 18,314 $ 20,098 32.1 % 32.4 %  The Company's estimated annual 2017 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is expected to be approximately 36.0%. Our rate is lower than expected due to the impact of excess tax benefits on stock compensation. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the occasional use of our revolving credit facility. Our cash and investments decreased $3.9 million from December 31, 2016 to September 30, 2017 and totaled $39.9 million at September 30, 2017. - 19 - Under the line of credit, there was one standby letter of credit of $0.8 million as of September 30, 2017. At September 30, 2017, we have $29.2 million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility. No fees are associated with the unused portion of the committed amount. We had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Interest on borrowings is payable monthly at LIBOR plus 2.5%. The termination date of the revolving credit facility is July 27, 2018. At September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility. We are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. These covenants require that we meet certain parameters related to our tangible net worth and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio. At September 30, 2017, our tangible net worth was $230.3 million, which meets the requirement of being at or above $125.0 million. Our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio was 0.32 to 1.0 which meets the requirement of not being above 2 to 1. Authorizations - The Board has authorized three stock repurchase programs for the Company. The Company may purchase shares on the open market from time to time, up to a total of 5.7 million shares. The Board must authorize the timing and amount of these purchases. Effective May 24, 2016, the Board authorized up to $25.0 million in open market repurchases and on June 2, 2016, the Company executed a repurchase agreement in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC allowing the Company to repurchase an aggregate amount of $25.0 million or a total of approximately 2.0 million shares from the open market.

AAON,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in this report, and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. This discussion contains or incorporates by reference ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results, based on information available at the time this report is filed with the SEC or, with respect to any document incorporated by reference, available at the time that such document was prepared. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those identified in the section entitled ""Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the section entitled ""Risk Factors"" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. We do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, new information or circumstances or otherwise, except as required by law. Overview We engineer, manufacture and market air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of standard, semi-custom and custom rooftop units, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps and coils. These products are marketed and sold to retail, manufacturing, educational, lodging, supermarket, medical and other commercial industries. We market our products to all 50 states in the United States and certain provinces in Canada. Foreign sales were approximately $5.5 million of our total net sales for the six months just ended and $7.9 million of our sales during the same period of 2016. Our business can be affected by a number of economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. The uncertainty of the economy has negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets. A further decline in economic activity could result in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability. Sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate closely to the number of new homes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, consumer spending habits, employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. We sell our products to property owners and contractors through a network of manufacturers' representatives and our internal sales force. The demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors. The commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts, but has a lag factor of six to 18 months. Housing starts, in turn, are affected by such factors as interest rates, the state of the economy, population growth and the relative age of the population. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market. The new construction market in 2016 through the second quarter of 2017 continued to be unpredictable and uneven. Thus, we continue to emphasize promotion of the benefits of AAON equipment to property owners in the replacement market. The principal components of cost of goods sold are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight and engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum, and are obtained from domestic suppliers. We also purchase from domestic manufacturers certain components, including compressors, motors and electrical controls. The price levels of our raw materials have remained relatively consistent the past few years, but the market continues to be volatile and unpredictable as a result of the uncertainty related to the U.S. economy and a weakening global economy. For the six months ended June 30, 2017, the price for aluminum, galvanized steel and stainless steel increased by approximately 1.2%, 7.9%, and 0.9%, respectively, while the price for copper decreased by approximately 3.7% from the six months ended June 30, 2016. In 2015, AAON initiated the design of a new Water Source Heat Pump product line and its affiliated manufacturing facility. We have brought the product into the marketplace and are in the final stages of completing this introduction into a $500-$600 million new market. In 2016, we began construction of a 162,000 square foot laboratory building with ten testing cells contained within it. This unique laboratory will have capabilities beyond anything known to exist in the world and will elevate AAON's research and design capabilities accordingly. Completion of this lab in 2018 will therefore be quite significant. - 16 - The following are recent highlights and items that impacted our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: Overall units sold increased approximately 5.3% as compared to the same period last year. Cash and cash equivalents increased $9.4 million primarily from cash inflows from operations. We invested $16.8 million in capital expenditures in connection with the construction of our new research and development lab, water source heat pump line and other internal projects. Increased warranty costs due modifications and refinements in our policy, which are expected to be short-term. Backlog The following table shows our historical backlog levels: Results of Operations Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 vs. Three Months Ended June 30, 2016 Units Sold Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 Rooftop Units 4,173 4,759 Split Systems 1,397 937 Outdoor Mechanical Rooms 15 22 Water Source Heat Pumps 518 76 Total Units 6,103 5,794  Net Sales Three Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 Change % Change (in thousands, except unit data) Net sales $ 101,326 $ 102,319 $ (993 ) (1.0 )% Total units 6,103 5,794 309 5.3 %  Total units sold for the three months ended June 30, 2017 are up, but net sales remain relatively flat due to changes in our product mix. - 17 - Cost of Sales Three Months Ended June 30, Percent of Sales 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Cost of sales $ 69,648 $ 69,572 68.7 % 68.0 % Gross Profit 31,678 32,747 31.3 % 32.0 %  As noted in our raw material prices below, the Company has seen increases in our cost of sales due to the increased steel prices. This increase is offset slightly by better absorption of overhead. The principal components of cost of sales are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight out and engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum, which are obtained from domestic suppliers. Twelve-month average raw material cost per pound as of June 30:  2017 2016 % Change Copper $ 3.37 $ 3.50 (3.7 )% Galvanized Steel $ 0.41 $ 0.38 7.9 % Stainless Steel $ 1.18 $ 1.17 0.9 % Aluminum $ 1.68 $ 1.66 1.2 %  Selling, General and Administrative Expenses  Three Months Ended June 30, Percent of Sales 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Warranty $ 3,102 $ 1,328 3.1 % 1.3 % Profit Sharing 2,154 2,517 2.1 % 2.5 % Salaries & Benefits 2,427 3,160 2.4 % 3.1 % Stock Compensation 1,367 749 1.3 % 0.7 % Advertising 171 448 0.2 % 0.4 % Depreciation 154 214 0.2 % 0.2 % Insurance 205 315 0.2 % 0.3 % Professional Fees 262 281 0.3 % 0.3 % Donations 189 103 0.2 % 0.1 % Bad Debt Expense (43 ) (165 ) - % (0.2 )% Other 1,983 1,611 2.0 % 1.6 % Total SG&A $ 11,971 $ 10,561 11.8 % 10.3 %  The overall increase in SG&A was primarily due to increased warranty expenses. The Company has been working on modifications and refinements to its warranty policy. These modifications more clearly define what qualifies as a warranty claim and puts a deadline for when claims may be submitted. This has increased our warranty reserve and increased our warranty expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017. - 18 - Income Taxes Three Months Ended June 30, Effective Tax Rate 2017 2016 2017 2016 (in thousands) Income tax provision $ 5,970 $ 7,550 30.2 % 33.9 %  The Company's estimated annual 2017 effective tax rate, excluding discrete events, is expected to be approximately 36.0%. Additionally, the Company early adopted ASU 2016-09, Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting, applying the changes for excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies prospectively effective January 1, 2016. As a result, excess tax benefits and deficiencies are reported as an income tax benefit or expense on the statement of income rather than as a component of additional paid-in capital on the statement of equity. Excess tax benefits and deficiencies are treated as discrete items to the income tax provision in the reporting period in which they occur. For the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $1.0 million and $0.4 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits as an income tax benefit.

For the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, the Company recorded $1.9 million and $1.1 million, respectively, in excess tax benefits as an income tax benefit. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements are generally met through net cash provided by operations and the occasional use of our revolving credit facility. Our cash and investments increased $8.1 million from December 31, 2016 to June 30, 2017 and totaled $51.8 million at June 30, 2017. Under the line of credit, there was one standby letter of credit of $0.8 million as of June 30, 2017. At June 30, 2017, we have $29.2 million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility. No fees are associated with the unused portion of the committed amount. We had no outstanding balance under the revolving credit facility at June 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016. Interest on borrowings is payable monthly at LIBOR plus 2.5%. The termination date of the revolving credit facility is July 27, 2018. At June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under the revolving credit facility. We are obligated to comply with certain financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. These covenants require that we meet certain parameters related to our tangible net worth and total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio. At June 30, 2017, our tangible net worth was $217.7 million, which meets the requirement of being at or above $125.0 million. Our total liabilities to tangible net worth ratio was 0.31 to 1.0 which meets the requirement of not being above 2 to 1. The Board has authorized three stock repurchase programs for the Company. The Company may purchase shares on the open market from time to time, up to a total of 5.7 million shares. The Board must authorize the timing and amount of these purchases. Effective May 24, 2016, the Board authorized up to $25.0 million in open market repurchases and on June 2, 2016, the Company executed a repurchase agreement in accordance with the rules and regulations of the SEC allowing the Company to repurchase an aggregate amount of $25.0 million or a total of approximately 2.0 million shares from the open market.

AAON,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in this report, and our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, which are included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. This discussion contains or incorporates by reference ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts, but rather are based on expectations, estimates, assumptions and projections about our industry, business and future financial results, based on information available at the time this report is filed with the SEC or, with respect to any document incorporated by reference, available at the time that such document was prepared. Our actual results could differ materially from the results contemplated by these forward-looking statements due to a number of factors, including those identified in the section entitled ""Forward-Looking Statements"" in this Item 2 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and in the section entitled ""Risk Factors"" in Item 1A of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. We do not assume any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements to reflect changed assumptions, the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events, new information or circumstances or otherwise, except as required by law. Overview We engineer, manufacture and market air conditioning and heating equipment consisting of standard, semi-custom and custom rooftop units, chillers, packaged outdoor mechanical rooms, air handling units, makeup air units, energy recovery units, condensing units, geothermal/water-source heat pumps and coils. These products are marketed and sold to retail, manufacturing, educational, lodging, supermarket, medical and other commercial industries. We market our products to all 50 states in the United States and certain provinces in Canada. Foreign sales were approximately $2.1 million of our total net sales for the three months just ended and $4.3 million of our sales during the same period of 2016. Our business can be affected by a number of economic factors, including the level of economic activity in the markets in which we operate. The uncertainty of the economy has negatively impacted the commercial and industrial new construction markets. A further decline in economic activity could result in a decrease in our sales volume and profitability. Sales in the commercial and industrial new construction markets correlate closely to the number of new homes and buildings that are built, which in turn is influenced by cyclical factors such as interest rates, inflation, consumer spending habits, employment rates and other macroeconomic factors over which we have no control. We sell our products to property owners and contractors through a network of manufacturers' representatives and our internal sales force. The demand for our products is influenced by national and regional economic and demographic factors. The commercial and industrial new construction market is subject to cyclical fluctuations in that it is generally tied to housing starts, but has a lag factor of six to 18 months. Housing starts, in turn, are affected by such factors as interest rates, the state of the economy, population growth and the relative age of the population. When new construction is down, we emphasize the replacement market. The new construction market in 2016 through the first quarter of 2017 continued to be unpredictable and uneven. Thus, we continue to emphasize promotion of the benefits of AAON equipment to property owners in the replacement market. The principal components of cost of goods sold are labor, raw materials, component costs, factory overhead, freight and engineering expense. The principal high volume raw materials used in our manufacturing processes are steel, copper and aluminum, and are obtained from domestic suppliers. We also purchase from domestic manufacturers certain components, including compressors, motors and electrical controls. The price levels of our raw materials have remained relatively consistent the past few years, but the market continues to be volatile and unpredictable as a result of the uncertainty related to the U.S. economy and a weakening global economy. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the price for copper, galvanized steel and stainless steel decreased by approximately 7.5%, 0.0%, and 4.1%, respectively, while the price for aluminum increased by approximately 1.2% from the three months ended March 31, 2016. In 2011, we began using an all aluminum microchannel condenser coil on our small rooftop unit product line and, in 2013, we began using this condenser coil in our larger rooftop product line as well. The condenser coil is the outdoor coil of a conventional air conditioning system. We are using this type of condenser coil substantially throughout the complete rooftop unit product line. This has reduced our copper tube usage in this component of the product, however, copper will remain a high volume raw material because of its use throughout the equipment. The following are recent highlights and items that impacted our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition: - 16 - Overall units sold increased approximately 14.9% as compared to the same period last year, driving the increase in sales for the quarter. Cash and cash equivalents increased $7.5 million primarily from cash inflows from operations. We invested $6.1 million in capital expenditures in connection with the construction of our new research and development lab, water source heat pump line and other internal projects.

AAON, which was founded back in 1988, has since been actively involved in design, development, manufacture, and delivery of heating and cooling products to perform beyond all expectations. Prior to the announcement, on January 02, 2018, AAON declared that its personnel in employment as on January 01, 2018, excluding officers, would receive a $1,000 bonus in recognition of the new tax reform law. The Company employed over 2,000 individuals at its Tulsa, Oklahoma and Longview, Texas facilities. AAON stated that as most employees were shareholders of the Company, and would benefit as a result of the new tax law, it felt that it would be appropriate to provide a direct recognition of their importance in the Company's future success. Company Growth Prospects Recently, on February 27, 2018, AAON announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and for the full fiscal year 2017. The Company recorded net sales of $104.2 million in Q4 2017, up 13.6% from $91.7 million in Q4 2016.

The Company's net income of $54.5 million for FY17 was also a record, advancing 2.1% compared to $53.4 million in FY16. Moreover, owing to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Job Act on December 22, 2017, the corporate income tax rate declined from 35% to 21%, starting in 2018. The Company hence observed a $4.4 million benefit in its income tax provision.

AAON,"TULSA, Okla., Feb 27, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- AAON, INC. AAON, +1.04% today announced its results for the fourth quarter and year 2017. Sales in the fourth quarter were $104.2 million, up 13.6% from $91.7 million in 2016. Net income was $15.8 million, increasing 38.1% from $11.4 million in the same period a year ago. Sales for the year 2017 reached a record level, $405.2 million, representing a gain of 5.5% compared to $384.0 million in 2016. Net income for 2017 was also a record, $54.5 million, rising 2.1% compared to $53.4 million in 2016. Earnings for the fourth quarter of 2017 were $0.30 per diluted share, up 39.4% from $0.21 per diluted share in 2016, based upon 52.9 million and 53.4 million diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Earnings per diluted share for the years 2017 and 2016 were $1.03 and $1.00, representing a gain of 3.0%, based upon 53.1 million and 53.4 million diluted shares outstanding, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the quarter increased $5.1 million to $13.7 million (13.2% of sales) from $8.6 million (9.4% of sales) as compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This increase is due to warranty expense and increases in salaries and benefits. For the year, SG&A expenses increased $10.7 million to $49.2 million (12.2% of sales) from $38.5 million (10.0% of sales) as compared to 2016. In addition to the increases in warranty from modifications made to our warranty policy, the Company had two officers retire during the year, which resulted in accelerated vesting of stock awards and approximately $1.0 million in additional stock compensation expense. The Company expects our SG&A expense will return to a more normal level in 2018. The Tax Cuts and Job Act (the ""Act"") was enacted on December 22, 2017. The Act lowered the corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% starting in 2018. Due to this change, the Company remeasured its deferred tax assets and liabilities on the enactment date, which resulted in a $4.4 million benefit to our income tax provision. Norman H. Asbjornson, CEO, said, ""The Act allows us to improve our compensation to employees and cash distribution to shareholders as well as defer future price increases to customers."" Mr. Asbjornson continued, ""Our financial condition at December 31, 2017 remained quite strong with a current ratio of 3.1:1 (including cash and short-term investments totaling $30.4 million). We also remain debt free. Our backlog at December 31, 2017 increased 65.3% to $81.2 million, from $49.1 million for the same period a year ago."" Gary Fields, President, added, ""During 2018, we will continue to witness the results of our significant capital investment program. Two new Water-Source Heat Pump lines will begin production and our state of the industry laboratory will initiate operations. These investments, I believe, will have a major impact on AAON's growth in the years ahead."" The Company will host a conference call today at 4:15 P.M.

accounting principles (""GAAP""), an additional non-GAAP financial measure is provided and reconciled in the following table. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provide information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances the ability of investors to analyze the Company's business trends and operating performance. EBITDAX EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund operations. The Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) depreciation, (2) amortization of bond premiums, (3) share-based compensation, (4) interest (income) expense and (5) income tax expense. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP. The Company's EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand the Company's operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance. EBITDAX, as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the Company's management team, and by other users of the Company's consolidated financial statements. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated:           Three Months Ended  December 31,   Years Ending December 31,   2017   2016   2017   2016   (in thousands) Net Income, a GAAP measure $ 15,770     $ 11,420     $ 54,498     $ 53,376   Depreciation 3,982     3,488     15,007     13,035   Amortization of bond premiums 8     33     47     249   Share-based compensation 1,498     1,185     6,458     4,357   Interest (income) expense (91 )   (102 )   (345 )   (541 ) Income tax expense 1,680     6,517     19,994     26,615   EBITDAX, a non-GAAP measure $ 22,847     $ 22,541     $ 95,659     $ 97,091                                   For Further Information: Jerry R.

AAON,"TULSA, Okla., Nov 02, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- AAON, Inc. AAON, +1.04% today announced its operating results for the third quarter and nine months ended September 30, 2017. In the quarter ended September 30, 2017, net sales were $113.7 million, up 8.7% from $104.6 million in 2016. Net income was $14.7 million, a decline of 6.2% from $15.7 million in the same period a year ago. Net sales for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $301.1 million, increasing 3.0% from $292.3 million in 2016. Net income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $38.7 million, down 7.7% from $42.0 million in 2016. Earnings per diluted share in the third quarter of 2017 were $0.28, down 3.4% from $0.29 for the same period in 2016, based upon 53.0 million and 53.4 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Earnings per diluted share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $0.73, a decrease of 6.4% from $0.78 in 2016, based upon 53.1 million and 53.5 million shares outstanding at September 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our backlog at September 30, 2017 increased 19% to $73.8 million, from $62.2 million for the same period a year ago. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $2.6 million or 25.3% to $13.0 million (11.5% of sales) from $10.4 million (9.9% of sales) as compared to the third quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily due to warranty expense and modifications the Company has made during the year to its warranty policy. These modifications more clearly define what qualifies as a warranty claim and place a deadline for when claims may be submitted. The Company continues to expect these changes will benefit the Company in the long term with better customer relationships. We are still awaiting certifications from AHRI on our new water-source heat pump (WSHP) products. However, we are seeing significant increases in WSHP orders, the bulk of which will be delivered by the end of 2017. With the approval of certifications, we anticipate WSHP orders will increase substantially in 2018. Capital expenditures for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $26.4 million and for the total year 2017 we estimate we will reach $47-$50 million to complete work on our first automated WSHP line, start work on one of the two additional WSHP lines and the construction of our state of the art laboratory. For 2018, we currently estimate total capital expenditures in the range of $35-$37 million to finish work on our second WSHP line, start work on our third WSHP line and increase our sheet metal capacity with additional Salvagnini machines. Norman H. Asbjornson, CEO, said, ""We're happy to witness revenue growth and improvement in our production. We continue to make investments in our research and development and capital expenditures so that revenues accelerate in 2018 and beyond. We are now less than a year from opening the Norman Asbjornson Innovation Center, our state of the art acoustical and performance measuring laboratory. The ability to do testing in this facility for ourselves and customers will allow us to introduce new products at a more rapid rate while generating additional revenue."" Mr. Asbjornson concluded, ""Our financial condition at September 30, 2017 remains strong with a current ratio of 2.7:1 (including cash and short-term investments totaling $39.9 million) and we continue to operate debt free."" The Company will host a conference call today at 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time to discuss the third quarter results.

accounting principles (""GAAP""), an additional non-GAAP financial measure is provided and reconciled in the following table. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provides information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances the ability of investors to analyze the Company's business trends and operating performance. EBITDAX EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund operations. The Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) depreciation, (2) amortization of bond premiums, (3) share-based compensation, (4) interest (income) expense and (5) income tax expense. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP. The Company's EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand the Company's operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance. EBITDAX, as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the Company's management team and by other users of the Company's consolidated financial statements. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated:   Three Months Ended  September 30,   Nine Months Ended  September 30,       2017   2016   2017   2016   (in thousands) Net Income, a GAAP measure $ 14,717     $ 15,682     $ 38,728     $ 41,956   Depreciation 3,744     3,201     11,025     9,547   Amortization of bond premiums 10     65     39     216   Share-based compensation 1,431     1,129     4,960     3,172   Interest income (93 )   (147 )   (254 )   (439 ) Income tax expense 8,033     7,080     18,314     20,098   EBITDAX, a non-GAAP measure $ 27,842     $ 27,010     $ 72,812     $ 74,550    For Further Information: Jerry R.

AAON,"TULSA, Okla., Aug 03, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- AAON, Inc. AAON, +1.04% today announced its operating results for the second quarter and six months ended June 30, 2017. In the quarter ended June 30, 2017, net sales were $101.3 million, down 1.0% from $102.3 million in 2016. Net income was $13.8 million, a decline of 6.3% from $14.7 million in the same period a year ago. Net sales for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $187.4 million, decreasing 0.2% from $187.7 million in 2016. Net income for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $24.0 million, off 8.6% from $26.3 million in 2016. Our backlog at June 30, 2017 increased 20% to $83.5 million, from $69.3 million for the same period a year ago. Consistent with the results of the first quarter of 2017, during the second quarter of 2017 increases in manufacturing costs restricted gross profits which declined 3.3% to $31.7 million (31.3% of sales) versus $32.7 million (32.0% of sales) as compared to the second quarter of 2016. This increase is primarily due to higher raw material (steel) prices. Selling, general and administrative expenses, impacted by unusually higher warranty expenses, increased $1.4 million or 13.4% to $12.0 million (11.8% of sales) from $10.6 million (10.3% of sales) as compared to the second quarter of 2016. The Company has been working on modifications and refinements to its warranty policy. These modifications more clearly define what qualifies as a valid warranty claim and place a deadline on when claims may be submitted. This has increased our warranty reserves and increased our warranty expense for the first six months of 2017. Going forward, the Company expects warranty expense will return to historical levels and the new policy will improve our customer satisfaction as well as financial control of the warranty process and supplier relationships, thereby creating significant benefit to the Company. Earnings per diluted share in the second quarter of 2017 were $0.26, down 3.7% from $0.27 for the same period in 2016, based upon 53.2 million and 53.6 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Earnings per diluted share for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $0.45, a decrease of 4.3% from $0.47 in 2016, based upon 53.2 million and 53.6 million shares outstanding at June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Norman H. Asbjornson, CEO, said, ""As previously announced, we have had significant changes in our manufacturing supervisory personnel. In April, our Vice President of Manufacturing and Tulsa Plant Manager both retired, after more than 60 years of combined service to the Company. Mike Crews, our Vice President of Operations, and Hunter Mattocks, Director of Manufacturing, are working hard to make the transition and we have the utmost confidence in their abilities. However, there is a somewhat lengthy learning curve associated with the transition process and our revenue for the first half of the year reflects the short-term challenges created by these changes in addition to the difficult labor markets. Nonetheless, our incoming order rate remains strong (with backlog rising to $83.5 million at June 30, 2017) and we expect to see excellent improvement in our revenue growth once we complete the transition process."" Mr. Asbjornson further added, ""While our Water-Source Heat Pump has already won industry awards for design, performance and serviceability, we are awaiting AHRI certification which will enhance our sales and marketing program. In addition, we are currently integrating some of the cutting-edge manufacturing technology from the new line into our existing product lines with the expectation of gaining additional efficiencies."" Mr. Asbjornson concluded, ""Our financial condition at June 30, 2017 remains strong with a current ratio of 2.9:1 (including cash and short-term investments totaling $51.8 million) and we continue to operate debt free.""

To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), an additional non-GAAP financial measure is provided and reconciled in the following table. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provides information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances the ability of investors to analyze the Company's business trends and operating performance. EBITDAX EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund operations. The Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) depreciation, (2) amortization of bond premiums, (3) share-based compensation, (4) interest (income) expense and (5) income tax expense. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP. The Company's EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand the Company's operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance. EBITDAX, as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the Company's management team and by other users of the Company's consolidated financial statements. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated:   Three Months Ended  June 30,   Six Months Ended  June 30,       2017   2016   2017   2016   (in thousands) Net Income, a GAAP measure $ 13,794     $ 14,725     $ 24,011     $ 26,276   Depreciation 3,643     3,175     7,281     6,346   Amortization of bond premiums 13     68     29     151   Share-based compensation 1,884     1,095     3,529     2,043   Interest income (85 )   (135 )   (161 )   (292 ) Income tax expense 5,970     7,550     10,281     13,016   EBITDAX, a non-GAAP measure $ 25,219     $ 26,478     $ 44,970     $ 47,540     For Further Information: Jerry R.

AAON,"AMES, Iowa, May 31, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Workiva WK, +2.60% a leading provider of solutions for enterprise productivity, announces that AAON Inc. AAON, +1.04% uses the Wdesk platform to streamline its Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) and internal controls processes. “My favorite feature in Wdesk is its data linking,” said Rebecca Thompson, Chief Accounting Officer at Tulsa-based AAON. “Our previous system was largely manual, so we had accuracy issues. But with Wdesk, I don’t have to worry about missing a number somewhere in a document or spreadsheet because all of our data is linked together.” “Before Wdesk, we always had issues with updating our SOX narratives, control matrices and testing, and it was difficult to track and review the testing,” she said. “Now, I can track the progress of my colleagues and our outside consultant in Wdesk.” Thompson also has better control over the process because Wdesk permissioning enables her to grant access to selected users with a full audit trail of every change. “This kind of control provides accountability, so nothing slips by me that I don’t know about,” she said. Wdesk also has enabled AAON to reduce its reliance on outside consultants. “As we bring more of the process owners’ reports, documents and testing into Wdesk, we’re benefiting from many new insights into our SOX process,” said Thompson. Thompson also raves about Wdesk’s black-line feature and audit trail. “It has really worked out well with our auditors. They are able to post and close all comments directly within shared Wdesk documents. Everyone is working on the most up-to-date version, and I always know what has been done and what is left to do.” The efficiencies gained with Wdesk free Thompson from tedious administrative tasks, giving her more time to analyze data and reports. Thompson said AAON’s transition to Wdesk for SOX reporting was seamless. “Workiva’s platform is intuitive, so the learning curve is not too steep. It also helps that our customer success manager is very responsive.” She intends to continue transforming AAON’s paper-based processes into digital ones. “With all of Wdesk’s excellent features, it’s easy to see how a company could use the platform to streamline any sort of business process,” Thompson said. About Workiva Workiva WK, +2.60% delivers Wdesk, an intuitive cloud platform that modernizes how people work within thousands of organizations, including over 70 percent of the Fortune 500 [®] .

AAON,"TULSA, Okla., May 04, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- AAON, Inc. AAON, +1.04% today announced its operating results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017.  Net sales in the first quarter gained 0.8% to $86.1 million from $85.4 million in the corresponding period in 2016. Net income declined 11.5% to $10.2 million, or $0.19 per diluted share, as compared with $11.6 million, or $0.22 per diluted share for the same period a year ago, based upon 53.2 million and 53.6 million diluted shares outstanding at March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Mr. Asbjornson said, ""The Company had a slow start to the year because of weak order input in the fourth quarter. Toward the final half of the first quarter, the order input rate improved and we ended the quarter with a near record backlog of $68.9 million, up 40.9% from December 31, 2016 and up 14.3% from the same period a year ago. The firm rate of order input has continued into the current quarter."" Increases in manufacturing costs restricted gross profits which declined 2.9% to $25.0 million (29.0% of sales) versus $25.7 million (30.1% of sales). Selling, general and administrative expenses, impacted by unusually higher warranty expenses, non-recurring advertising and promotional costs as well as increased stock compensation expenses, all combined to cause these costs to increase $1.6 million or 18.1% to $10.5 million (12.2% of sales) from $8.9 million (10.4% of sales) during the same period a year ago. Norman H. Asbjornson, CEO, said, ""We implemented selective price increases on March 1st which should begin to impact our sales in the latter half of the year. We are closely monitoring our SG&A expenses and we expect to witness reduction of these expenses throughout the year."" Mr. Asbjornson further added, ""Although we continue to restrain our sales effort to ensure initial customer satisfaction, our new Water-Source Heat Pump line production is exhibiting excellent progress."" Mr. Asbjornson concluded, ""Our financial condition at March 31, 2017 is strong with a current ratio of 3.6:1 (including cash and short-term investments totaling $41.9 million) and we continue to remain debt free. The combination of increasing sales and moderating SG&A expenses should enable us to once again post record sales and earnings for the current year."" The Company will host a conference call today at 4:15 P.M. Eastern Time to discuss the first quarter results.

Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures To supplement the Company's consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (""GAAP""), an additional non-GAAP financial measure is provided and reconciled in the following table. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure, when considered together with the GAAP financial measures, provides information that is useful to investors in understanding period-over-period operating results. The Company believes that this non-GAAP financial measure enhances the ability of investors to analyze the Company's business trends and operating performance. EBITDAX EBITDAX (as defined below) is presented herein and reconciled from the GAAP measure of net income because of its wide acceptance by the investment community as a financial indicator of a company's ability to internally fund operations. The Company defines EBITDAX as net income, plus (1) depreciation, (2) amortization of bond premiums, (3) share-based compensation, (4) interest (income) expense and (5) income tax expense. EBITDAX is not a measure of net income or cash flows as determined by GAAP. The Company's EBITDAX measure provides additional information which may be used to better understand the Company's operations. EBITDAX is one of several metrics that the Company uses as a supplemental financial measurement in the evaluation of its business and should not be considered as an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income, as an indicator of operating performance. Certain items excluded from EBITDAX are significant components in understanding and assessing a company's financial performance. EBITDAX, as used by the Company, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. The Company believes that EBITDAX is a widely followed measure of operating performance and is one of many metrics used by the Company's management team and by other users of the Company's consolidated financial statements. The following table provides a reconciliation of net income (GAAP) to EBITDAX (non-GAAP) for the periods indicated:       Three Months Ended  March 31,             2017   2016       (in thousands) Net Income, a GAAP measure                         $ 10,217     $ 11,551   Depreciation     3,638     3,171   Amortization of bond premiums     16     83   Share-based compensation     1,645     948   Interest income     (76 )   (157 ) Income tax expense     4,311     5,466   EBITDAX, a non-GAAP measure     $ 19,751     $ 21,062      For Further Information: Jerry R.
