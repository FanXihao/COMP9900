OC,"U.S. stocks on Wednesday ended a tumultuous session firmly lower after minutes from the Federal Reserve’s most recent policy-setting meeting sparked a fresh wave of volatility, as bond rates clambered higher and the dollar strengthened, weighing on equities. What are the main benchmarks doing? The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -0.94% lost 166.97 points, or 0.7%, to 24,797.78, after seeing an afternoon rally of 303 points, or 1.2%, at its session peak. The S&P 500 index SPX, -1.38% fell 14.93 points to 2,701.33, a drop of 0.6%, but was up by as much as 31.69 points or 1.2%. The Nasdaq Composite Index COMP, -1.86% meanwhile, shed 16.08 points, or 0.2%, to 7,218.23. All three benchmarks experienced brisk reversals in the afternoon, about an hour before the regular trading session ended and an hour after the FOMC minutes were released. Recent trading has been marked by volatility, with equities posting sharp swings in both directions. Stocks also tumbled Tuesday, quashing a six-day rally for the Dow and S&P 500. The Dow industrials are down 5.2% for the month, attributed partly to signs of an uptick in inflation and bets the U.S. central bank won’t delay in raising interest rates further. Higher rates can lure money out of equities and increase borrowing costs for corporations. What could drive markets? U.S. equity gauges retreated as investors struggled to digest minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee, which pointed to a strong economy, but also the “increased likelihood” of more rate hikes ahead. The news pushed the U.S. dollar higher and sent the yield for the 10-year Treasury note TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.69% to a fresh four-year peak of 2.95%. Wall Street has been driven by the prospect of inflation returning to the economy, and the Fed having to become more aggressive in raising rates to combat it. What did the Fed minutes say? Minutes of the Jan. 30-31 Federal Open Market Committee meeting showed that officials saw a stronger economy than at the end of 2017 and that more rate increases were in the offing. The strengthening “increased the likelihood that a gradual upward trajectory of the federal-funds rate would be appropriate.” The FOMC altered its message to point to “further gradual increases,” emphasizing its desire to resume rates increases in 2018, according to the minutes. See: Higher inflation, tax-and-spend boom has investors looking for Fed clues What are strategists saying? “Rising rates, if the rates go up far enough, could be a problem not just for the stock market but for the economy,” said Bruce Bittles, chief investment strategist at Baird. That said, Bittles was doubtful that real inflation was picking up. “Demographics are such that we have 10,000 people retiring every day and being replaced by younger employees with lower salaries,” he said. He also said lower wages outside of the U.S. would keep pressure on inflation in the U.S. “I think for the most part everything in the minutes was fairly benign,” said Bruce McCain, chief investment strategist at Key Private Bank. “The problem is we haven’t resolved if there’s real inflation working its way through the system. We have no predisposition that we’ve cleared that hurdle,” he said. What data and speakers are driving trading? An index that tracks U.S. manufacturers rose to a nearly 3½-year high in February and a gauge for service-oriented companies hit a six-month peak, according to IHS Markit’s flash PMI. Separately, existing-home sales fell 3.2% in January. In an interview on Bloomberg Television, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari said he has “hope” that inflation is picking up, and that the U.S. central bank “can’t make policy based on market blips, up and down.” Check out: MarketWatch’s Economic Calendar Which stocks are in focus? The biggest beneficiaries of the Fed decision were banks, which were taking the expectation of more rate increases amid a stronger economic landscape as bullish. The SPDR S&P Regional Banking KRE, -1.37%  added 0.9%. Separately, the SPDR S&P Bank ETF KBE, -1.55%  rose by 0.7%. Shares of Walmart Inc. WMT, -2.82% fell 2.8%, extending a sharp selloff on Tuesday that represented its largest one-day percentage drop in 30 years. The results came in the wake of the retail king’s quarterly earnings report; analysts worried about a slowdown in online sales and pressure on profit margins. Walmart bucked the trend of generally strong quarterly results this quarter; Goldman Sachs referred to the current seas as “one of the strongest earnings seasons on record.” Read more: The stock market is ignoring ‘one of the strongest earnings seasons on record’ Owens Corning OC, -0.97%  fell 4.8% despite reporting fourth-quarter earnings that beat expectations.

DVN, -2.64%  sank 12% after it reported fourth-quarter results that missed expectations and gave a downbeat outlook.

LC, -2.71% tumbled 5.6% after the lender late Tuesday posted quarterly results that missed expectations. How are other assets performing? European stocks SXXP, +0.44% finished mostly higher, while Asian markets mostly closed higher. Oil futures US:CLJ8 ended lower ahead of a supply report. The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.11% rose by 0.4% after the Fed minutes, and gold futures US:GCG8 settled higher, gaining 0.3% to $1,335 an ounce, and extending those returns after the FOMC’s minutes. —Victor Reklaitis contributed to this article More from MarketWatch How Russian Trolls Collected Americans' Personal Information More Coverage Trump boasts about making up facts about trade deficit to Trudeau Bloodbath for cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin sheds 10%, now down 40% year-to-date Three reasons the stock market’s fundamentals look solid Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets NY Stock Exchange NASDAQ","Feb 21, 2018 5:07 p.m. ET",28,Dow gives up 300-point gain to end lower as bond yields rise after Fed minutes,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-futures-inch-lower-as-investors-brace-for-fed-minutes-2018-02-21

OC,"No doubt you’ve seen or heard reports about a housing shortage in the U.S. While this can make it difficult to buy a home, it can make you plenty of money as an investor, as long as the trend continues. Let’s take a broad look at dozens of housing-related stocks to find value. First, the big picture. This chart shows a very healthy market for sellers of new homes in the past five years, after the housing-market collapse and the 2008 financial crisis: Don’t miss: Builders could see another year of double-digit growth, analysts believe? Here’s how the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF XHB, -2.54% has performed this year through Dec. 12 against the S&P 500 Index SPX, -1.39% : FactSet The ETF tracks the S&P Homebuilders Select Industry Index, which includes 37 S&P 500 companies that build homes or provide related products or services. Here’s a 10-year chart comparing the total return of the ETF with the S&P 500, through Dec. 12: FactSet Of course, in December 2007, the housing-market collapse had already started and the forward-looking stock market had already sent shares of home builders and related companies plunging. Looking instead at an 11-year chart, the story changes to show a cyclical industry that can still perform very well over long periods: FactSet Other factors influence the housing market, of course, both nationally and regionally. There’s no sign of a slowdown for the U.S. economy, but the Federal Reserve is slowly and steadily raising short-term rates. Mortgage loan rates are still very low, but nobody knows how the tax-reform legislation that may be passed and signed into law by President Trump as early as next week might affect the housing market. Read: There will be ‘financial strain’ from tax-law change, home buyers say If you believe in the long-term strength of U.S. housing and are looking for a broad long-term investment, you might simply go with the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF and its 36 holdings. Another option is the iShares U.S. Home Construction ETF ITB, -2.94% which tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Select Home Construction Index and has 47 stock holdings. Even so, it is much more heavily concentrated in stocks of the largest home builders. The iShares ETF’s five largest holdings are all home builders, and they make up 45% of the fund. The fund has returned 54% through Dec. 12. The SPDR ETF’s top five holdings are four home builders and Home Depot (No. 5) that together comprise 25% of the fund. That fund has returned 28%, and the S&P 500 has returned 21% this year. A short-term look at the components of XHB We focused our screens on the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF.

We are showing sales per share, rather than raw revenue, because the per-share figures incorporate any dilution from the issuance of new shares for any reason (including to pay for acquisitions) as well as any decline in the share count brought about by stock buybacks. A company’s gross profit margin is sales, less the cost of goods or services sold, divided by sales. It is a measure of profitability for the core business and reflects pricing power. A declining margin might mean that a company has been forced to offer more discounts to defend its market share or to increase sales.

A longer-term look The first table showed sales per share and gross margin. It’s good if both are going up, of course, but these figures don’t incorporate other expenses or other problems companies face. There’s a new tool that you can use to make useful comparisons of companies to their industry competitors. It’s called return on corporate capital (ROCC) and was recently developed by the Shareholder Forum to help individual investors screen companies for quality. Also see: Why rentals are up, and what it means for the housing market The calculation is similar to return on invested capital (ROIC), but there are some differences. There’s no strict definition for ROIC. ROCC is calculated the same way for every company that’s publicly traded in the U.S., using annual data filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission: Net income plus interest expense and income taxes, divided by the ending balance of total assets less current liabilities other than interest-bearing debt. The idea is to measure how good a company’s management is at investing the money it raises or borrows. Each company’s ROCC is compared to its industry competitors, based on the company’s Standard Industrial Classification (SIC), which also comes from SEC filings. In other words, the subject company’s numbers are excluded from those of its industry SIC group when the comparison is made. The comparisons are available here for free. ROCC comparisons are most meaningful within industries. Banks, for example, tend to have lower ROCC than many other industries because it is their business to leverage capital by gathering deposits and borrowing money. Here’s a sample comparison of LGI Homes Inc. LGIH, -3.54%  to its SIC industry group: The Shareholder Forum You can see that the company’s average ROCC for five years has been well above that of its industry competitors, and that the numbers have been sloping upward over the past two years. Here are the components of the SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF again, in the same order, with average ROCC comparisons to their industry groups.

As illustrated, the S&P has reached uncharted territory, and is refusing to pull in. Near-term support holds around 2,155 — matching Friday’s low — and is followed by a firmer floor matching the 2015 closing peak of 2,131. Similarly, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.27%   has established a strong uptrend. In its case, modest initial support holds around 18,470, and is followed by an inflection point in the 18,350 area. Deeper support at 18,167 matches the April peak. And the Nasdaq Composite has reached its latest year-to-date peak. Near-term support matches last week’s high of 5,045, and is followed by a deeper floor slightly above the 5,000 mark. More broadly, the Nasdaq’s first significant support matches the June peak, also illustrated below. Widening the view to six months adds perspective. On this wider view, the Nasdaq’s directionally sharp spike from the June low is longer-term bullish. A potential intermediate-term target matches the late-December peak of 5,117. Still, the Nasdaq’s next true technical overhead rests at 5,164, closely matching the June and November 2015 peaks. Looking elsewhere, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has taken flight, reaching yet another all-time high. Though the index faces limited resistance — it’s reached uncharted territory — a projected intermediate-term target holds around 18,970. Conversely, potential support points rest at the 18,350 mark, the April peak of 18,167, and slightly above the 18,000 mark. Similarly, the S&P 500 has knifed to uncharted territory. The S&P’s corresponding target — projecting from the Brexit-fueled whipsaw — holds around 2,234, detailed in the next section. The bigger picture Broadly speaking, the U.S. benchmarks' bigger-picture technicals remain straightforward, and firmly bullish. Moving to the small-caps, the iShares Russell 2000 ETF IWM, -1.94%   has reached its next technical test. To reiterate, notable overhead spans from the 120 mark to last week’s high of 120.42. The IWM has topped early Tuesday at 119.97, and the retest remains underway. Meanwhile, the SPDR S&P MidCap 400 is pressing all-time highs. Recall that last week’s intraday high of 282.52 marked a record absolute peak. Still, the MDY’s all-time closing high of 281.66, established June 2015, hasn’t been surpassed. A retest is once again underway this week. Against this backdrop, the S&P 500 has knifed to uncharted territory. Each bar on the three-year chart above represents one week. The breakout is firmly-grounded from a technical standpoint. To start, recall that the prevailing rally originated with consecutive 9-to-1 up days from the Brexit-induced low. (An up day means that advancing volume surpassed declining volume by the given margin.) Separately, the prevailing rally also encompasses a 15-to-1 up day that placed the S&P at a weekly close of 2,130, just under the 2015 closing peak of 2,131. Combined, the three internally strong sessions placed the S&P 500 on the precipice of a breakout, and the index has followed through. In the process, the S&P 500 has reached uncharted territory — it faces no true technical resistance — and it’s acting like it. Still, an intermediate-term target can be assigned to the 2,234 area, projecting from the Brexit-induced whipsaw. (Take the pre-Brexit peak of 2,113 - 1,992 = 121 points. Then, project from the range: 2,113 + 121 = 2,234.) More broadly, the S&P 500 remains near-term extended, and due a cooling-off period, or consolidation phase. Nonetheless, the more important longer-term technicals support a bullish view, and the S&P 500 is attractive on pullbacks to support. The S&P’s first notable floor holds around 2,131, and is followed by deeper support spanning from 2,117 to 2,120. Tuesday’s Watch List The charts below detail names that are technically well positioned. These are radar screen names — sectors or stocks poised to move in the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, see The Technical Indicator Library. Drilling down further, the PowerShares QQQ ETF QQQ, -2.32%  is designed to track the 100 largest Nasdaq components. Technically, the shares have rallied to the year’s high, resolving a double bottom — the W formation — defined by the May and June lows. Its relatively tight one-week range signals muted selling pressure near resistance, positioning the shares for a potentially more decisive breakout. First support holds around 111.40, and is followed by a deeper floor around 110.50 Initially profiled Feb. 4, the SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +0.89%   has returned 14.9% and remains well positioned. Recent weakness places the shares at an attractive entry near the breakout point, and 3.3% under the July peak. Notable support rests fractionally above 125, and is followed by the 50-day moving average, currently 122.75. Moving to specific names, Williams Companies, Inc. WMB, -0.88%   is a large-cap oil and gas pipeline operator coming to life. Technically, the shares have edged to six-month highs, also clearing the 200-day moving average for the first time since August. The upturn punctuates a successful test of trendline support, and opens the path to a potentially more decisive breakout. Tactically, the mid-June peak offers an area to work against, circa 22.90, with a posture higher supporting a bullish bias. Williams Companies is also well positioned on the weekly chart. Owens Corning OC, -1.26%   is a large-cap manufacturer of glass fiber reinforcements used in commercial building materials, including insulation and roofing shingles, as well as in telecommunications cables and for other applications. Earlier this month, the shares knifed to all-time highs, clearing a range top matching the May peak. The breakout comes from an orderly June base, when factoring for Brexit, opening the path to a projected target around 57. First support rests at 52.40, and its technical bias points higher barring a violation. Initially profiled June 30, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, -3.68%   has added 7.4% and remains well positioned. Technically, the shares are challenging resistance at the June peak, an area matching four-year highs. Recent strength punctuates a successful test of first support, and has been fueled by increased volume, positioning the shares for a potentially more decisive breakout. Public since June 2013, Gigamon, Inc. US:GIMO   is a mid-cap developer of networking solutions. Earlier this month, the shares reached 52-week highs, clearing resistance at the June peak. It’s subsequently established a bullish flag — underpinned by the breakout point — positioning the shares to extend the uptrend. Consider that Gigamon has tagged a nominal record high this week, fueled by increased volume, also illustrated on the weekly chart.

OC,"Owens Corning said profit soared in its fourth quarter, easily beating Wall Street forecasts, as the company saw sales grow in its insulation and roofing business. Owens Corning makes insulation, roofing and fiberglass composites used in commercial and residential buildings. Chief Executive Mike Thaman said the company is seeing profit improve across all of its businesses, which helped drive its best year of earnings growth in the company's history. The company expects that momentum to continue in 2016 based on U.S. housing starts expectations and moderate growth across the globe. Citing its strong cash flow, the company announced a 6% increase in its quarterly dividend to 18 cents a share. For the period ended Dec. 31, Owens Corning reported a profit of $109 million, or 92 cents a share, up from $33 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Profit in the prior-year period included a bigger interest expense and a $46 million loss to pay back debt. Excluding one-time items, adjusted per-share profit rose 40% to 66 cents a share, beating the 45 cents a share analysts had forecast, according to Thomson Reuters. Revenue increased 3.2% to $1.3 billion, edging in just above the $1.29 billion analysts had forecast. Sales in its insulation business grew 5.7%, while its roofing sales rose 8.2%. Composites sales slipped 3.3%.

OC,"A big meeting on climate change in Paris has ended with a historic deal. Banks have been thinking about that hot-button topic — including how to make money from it. Bank of America Merrill Lynch has come up with more than 220 stocks from around the world that “have exposure to climate change-related solutions.” BAML’s broad roundup comes as Goldman Sachs offers its own ideas about the best “green” stocks. MarketWatch has whittled down BAML’s long list to just companies that have “high” exposure to such products or services, according to the bank, rather than only “medium” or “low” exposure. Also eliminated are companies that aren’t traded on U.S. exchanges. There are “9 entry points for investors wishing to play the climate change and low carbon solutions theme,” said BAML equity strategists Sarbjit Nahal, Beijia Ma and Felix Tran in a note released Dec. 1. They say the nine places to get involved are: “1) Energy Efficiency; 2) Wind; 3) Solar; 4) YieldCos; 5) Nextgen Vehicles, Batteries & Storage; 6) Nuclear; 7) Hydro; 8) Diversified Cleantech; and 9) Other Cleantech.” But the whittled-down list below covers just six of those nine areas, as there are no U.S.-listed companies with high exposure to wind, nuclear or diversified cleantech, according to BAML. The term “YieldCos” refers to renewable-energy spinoffs that promise high payouts, as Barron’s has put it. Without further ado, below are U.S.-listed stocks that BAML views as having high exposure to climate change-related products or services. The bank released its roundup as the Paris meeting began.

OC,"An earlier version of this column incorrectly reported the date of a report on jobless claims in ‘The Economy’ section. The error has been corrected. Shutterstock/Swill Klitch Time to go? Your answer to the headline on today’s column may be a flat out ‘no’, especially if you’re watching stock futures ride the post-China stimulus wave higher again. Futures are up, following the biggest gain in three weeks for Wall Street. But if we stripped away that move from China over the weekend, would we be looking at a different market and such a big bounce from that Friday rout? Jani at CrackedMarket says yesterday’s “low-volume rebound tells us owners remain confident and optimistic.” The blogger notes that the S&P 500 SPX, -1.76%  finished near the upper end of a 2,050-to-2,110 trading range that it has been stuck in since February. So either “launch the next rally leg, or this up-move stalls and we remain stuck inside the trading range,” says Jani. Watch that upper end today. Famed contrarian Mark Mobius of Franklin Templeton Investments says U.S. corporates are just bound to disappoint, so investors should back out of U.S. stocks and look elsewhere for excitement. Spoiler: He’s not afraid of China. Read more in our Call of the Day, below. Of course, big investment banks have been saying for a while that U.S. stocks are going to grind higher, and don’t expect fireworks. Or, as Jefferies said in a note this morning, “there are no more ‘perfect investments’, given the U.S. bull market’s maturity, and the economic message remains mixed.” Though in the next breath, Jefferies also recommended investors take a look at building and construction stocks, like Owens Corning OC, -1.21%  and USG Corp. USG, -2.45% while Cantor Fitzgerald is finding much love for retailers at the moment. But does it hurt hear to hear what a naysayer has to say? We’re building up to some pretty key earnings for investors this week, which may also get the bulls more fired up, or not. Watch for Yahoo and Chipotle later today. And then there is Greece — our Chart of the Day has something to say about that mess. Key market gauges Futures on the Dow US:YMM5  and the S&P US:ESM5  are in the black this morning, following similar moves around the globe. Asia had fairly powerful run today, with the Nikkei 225 NIK, -0.31%  up 1.4%, while the Hang Seng HSI, +0.24%  and Shanghai Composite SHCOMP, -0.18%  jumped 2.8% and 1.8%, respectively. Not to be left out, European stocks SXXP, +0.44%  added to yesterday’s rise. Oil CLM5, +0.17%  is down slightly, while gold US:GCM5  is inching higher and the dollar DXY, +0.02%  is holding steady.

The call Templeton’s Mark Mobius has told CNBC that investors should start rotating out of Wall Street and into emerging markets. He says the U.S. recovery is still in its early days, and corporate earnings have too many headwinds. Plus, the government has been hating on banks too much, to where they can’t support other businesses. “As a result, companies have been conserving cash and buying back shares. That doesn’t do much for earnings, so expansion isn’t really there except in the tech space,” Mobius said in an interview. He says investors should look at China, Indonesia, Thailand and Taiwan, and thinks Asian markets can weather any Fed taper tantrum. That is because the rest of the world is busy expanding its monetary policy, while the Fed is going the other direction. He said U.S. companies that are in emerging markets and global in scope are worth a look, if the price is right. He also said he doesn’t see the bull market in China ending soon, and smart investors will be buying those dips. “A correction of 20 % is expected ... take these corrections in stride, and take the opportunity to buy.” Here’s that whole interview. Of course, Mobius is kind of biased in favor of emerging markets, so some of you will probably be ready to thumb your nose at this call. CNBC reader GeneralelMartindale said: “I would rather own Apple than any ‘undervalued Chinese stocks.’ Cash rich, less speculative and WAY MORE TRANSPARENT. Mobius IMO can’t really evaluate individual Chinese stocks with the same degree of disclosure as U.S. stocks. Very risky business!!!” The economy There is no economic data slated for Tuesday. Nada! The market will have to run on its own steam today. The chart “Honestly, I can’t believe we’re still talking about Greece. And the thought of a ‘Grexit’ with potential chain reaction is just unimaginably stupid, if it is allowed to occur. That said, by now I hope your portfolio is well insulated against such a tail-risk event. If there was ever a gigantic risk to the financial markets that was so clearly telegraphed, then this is it.” That is Pragmatic Capitalism’s Cullen Roche talking about contagion from the crisis that just can’t seem to resolve itself. He was commenting on the following chart from Marc Chandler, who himself pointed out how peripheral bonds have been rising since the start of April.

OC,"Owens Corning lowered its earnings outlook for the year Friday as its roofing business continues to see weaker volumes. Shares slid nearly 7% in recent premarket trading as the company said weakness in roofing volumes seen in the first quarter continued in April and May, dragging down its full-year expectations. For 2014, the company now expects to report adjusted earnings before interest and taxes higher than the $416 million reported the prior year. In April, the company had projected adjusted earnings before taxes and interest of $500 million for the year. ""Continued weakness in the second quarter has introduced further uncertainty in the full-year financial outlook for the company's roofing business,"" the building-materials producer said in a statement. Roofing volumes for the first half of the year could be as much as 20% lower than the same period of 2013, though Owens Corning expects to recover some of the volume shortfall in the latter half of the year. Its insulation and composites businesses have shown improvement on the year, and earnings growth in these two segments will likely offset weakness in the roofing business, it added. Owens Corning will release its second-quarter results on July 23.

OC,"Owens Corning OC, -1.22% swung to fourth-quarter profit on stronger sales of building materials and fewer expenses related to efforts to cut costs. Shares rose 12% to $44.50 in recent premarket trading as the results topped expectations and the company announced its first quarterly dividend in 14 years. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Thaman said Owens Corning's insulation business returned to the black in 2013, noting it was ""an important achievement"" for the company. Mr. Thaman said all three of its main business segments improved last year, thanks to ""a stable and growing global economy and a recovering U.S. housing market."" & quot;We expect similar growth in 2014 and we are working to maintain the momentum we established last year,"" he added. The company's board declared a quarterly dividend of 16 cents a share, which will be the first such payment since 2000. Owens Corning reported a profit of $82 million, or 69 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $56 million, or 47 cents a share. Excluding restructuring-related expenses and other items, adjusted earnings rose to 44 cents from 11 cents. Revenue increased 10% to $1.28 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a per-share profit of 27 cents and revenue of $1.21 billion.

OC,"The most-popular small-cap stocks among hedge funds, according to our research tracking 13F filings, earn an average excess return of 18 percentage points per year (learn more about our small-cap strategy). We think that this is because small-cap stocks — which we define as those with market capitalizations between $1 billion and $5 billion — are often ignored by large institutional investors and in turn by the financial media, making it more likely that they are either overvalued or undervalued. As a result we think it can be useful to see what top managers like in this valuation range. Here are five small-cap stocks which billionaire Steve Cohen's SAC Capital Advisors reported owning at the end of December (or see the full list of stocks the fund reported owning). SAC increased its stake in Superior Energy Services SPN, -5.87% by 25% during the fourth quarter of 2012, to a total of 7.7 million shares. At a market capitalization of $4 billion, Superior trades at only 10 times its trailing earnings. At that level it barely needs to grow at all in order to be a good value, but analyst expectations are bullish with the forward P/E coming in at 9 and the five-year PEG ratio being only 0.6. Billionaire Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group was also buying Superior, and reported a position of 3.1 million shares in its own 13F. Cohen and his team had 2.5 million shares of auto parts company Visteon VC, -2.13% in their portfolio at the end of December. Visteon, which specializes in climate, electronic and interior components, is highly dependent on the broader economy as shown by its beta of 2.3. While in terms of trailing earnings the stock looks expensive — the trailing P/E is 30 — the sell-side is predicting that net income will recover nicely over the next couple years. Value investor Barry Rosenstein's JANA Partners was another major shareholder in Visteon during Q4 2012. Billionaires James Dinan and George Soros are also among Visteon shareholders. Cliffs Natural Resources CLF, +1.44% was another of SAC's small-cap picks, with the filing disclosing ownership of 3 million shares. As a producer of iron ore and metallurgical coal, Cliffs is dependent on demand for steel; with steel demand weak recently, the stock is down 70% in the last year and over 20% of the float is held short. Multiple insiders were selling shares of Cliffs in early March, though these sales took place well above where the stock is currently trading, and insider selling is often rational as it can increase diversification. The fund moved heavily into Owens Corning OC, -0.92% building a small position as of the end of September up to 2.7 million shares by the end of 2012. The provider of glass fiber and other building materials is another bullish play, since it depends on construction activity: the stock's beta is 1.8. We'd note that revenue was actually down slightly in the fourth quarter of 2012 vs. a year earlier. Analyst consensus has the stock trading at 12 times forward earnings estimates with a five-year PEG ratio of 0.8. Blue Ridge Capital, managed by Tiger Cub John Griffin, owned 6.7 million shares of Owens Corning. The 13F showed SAC with 3.9 million shares of NCR NCR, -2.13% at the beginning of January. Billionaire David Einhorn also likes NCR, and his hedge fund Greenlight Capital was buying shares to close December with over 10 million shares. NCR, which provides kiosks and terminals such as ATMs and point of sale terminals (it was formerly known as National Cash Register), did not have a good performance in 2012 in terms of net income, but analysts are optimistic. Their projections imply a forward earnings multiple of 9 and a five-year PEG ratio of 0.7. This column was written by Matt Doiron.

Excluding items such as restructuring cost s and losses related to Hurricane Sandy, the company posted earnings of 11 cents, down from 40 cents. Revenue fell 3.1% to $1.16 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters most recently projected earnings of 16 cents on revenue of $1.16 billion. Gross margin fell to 14.7% from 19.2%. The building-material's segment saw total sales dropped 1%, as growth in insulation sales were offset by lower roofing sales. Sales in the composites business were down 7.2%.

OC,"Billionaire David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital is a closely followed hedge fund manager, possibly most closely when he gives public presentations at investor conferences. He famously recommended shorting Green Mountain Coffee Roasters Inc. in October 2011, before the stock began plummeting; He had also been a public critic and short-seller of Lehman Brothers in late 2007 and 2008. See Einhorn's most recent stock picks. However, at least so far one, of his more recent short calls has been completely wrong: Einhorn led his presentation at the mid-May Ira Sohn Conference with a short thesis on Martin Marietta Materials US:MLM and the stock is up 22% since then, easily beating the market. The stock had been declining quite a bit in early May, so it might not be entirely fair to measure its performance from the conference date, but even if we use the beginning of May as our baseline Martin Marietta is up 11% against a flat S&P 500. Shortly after Einhorn made his presentation, Tiger Cub John Griffin's Blue Ridge Capital reported that it had increased its stake in Martin Marietta to 5.5% of the total shares outstanding. Given how well the stock has been doing, we guess that Griffin owes Einhorn a box of chocolates. The core of Einhorn's thesis was simple. The stock was trailing at a P/E of more than 30, implying that the market was expecting strong growth, but net income should actually be coming down as the construction-materials company (providing products such as limestone, granite, sand, and gravel) lost the benefits of short-term fiscal stimulus. Business has still been good, however, and in the third quarter of the year, Martin Marietta Materials experienced an 18% increase in revenue compared to the same period in 2011. Earnings were up 28%. Net income was actually down in the first nine months of 2012 versus a year ago, but that is more than accounted for by an unusual amount of business development costs in the first half of this year. Martin Marietta's valuation does look high, however, and while we don't have any information as to whether or not Einhorn is still short (short positions are not disclosed in 13F filings), it's possible that Greenlight was merely early. The forward P/E is 28, and that incorporates high growth expectations on the sell side for 2013. Even over the longer-term, analyst consensus is for fairly low earnings in relation to the stock price, with a five-year PEG ratio of 4. There have been significant insider sales at Martin Marietta, and the most recent data shows that 18% of outstanding shares are held short. While a number of hedge funds and other notable investors have large positions in the stock, the top holders in our database of 13F filings weren't very excited about the company during the third quarter of 2012. Tiger Cub John Griffin's hedge fund Blue Ridge Capital cut its stake 22% to just under 2 million shares (check out Griffin's favorite stocks) while Southeastern Asset Management and SPO Advisory held their positions about constant. Vulcan Materials Company US:VMC and Owens Corning US:OC are the closest peers for Martin Marietta Materials and we can also compare the company to other building materials providers such as Masco Corporation US:MAS and Armstrong World Industries US:AWI Vulcan has been struggling to be profitable at all despite its valuation of $6.7 billion, so investors may be acting even more optimistic about that company. Owens Corning had its revenue and earnings decline at double digit rates last quarter vs. a year earlier, though its P/E multiples are at a bit of a discount to Martin Marietta: the forward P/E, for example, is 16. Those consensus earnings are much higher than what the company has done on a trailing basis, so we don't think that Owens Corning is a good buy either. Masco is in a similar position to these two peers. Armstrong has even higher short interest than Martin Marietta, but its multiples look more modest, so we'd advise against taking a short position. So far Einhorn has been wrong on Martin Marietta, but even with the stock's good performance since earlier this year, we don't think that it's a buy right now. The growth numbers are a plus, but judging by the P/E multiples, the market seems to have priced in an even higher growth rate over the next few years.","Dec 11, 2012 10:20 a.m. ET",2,Einhorn takes on another hedge fund manager,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/einhorn-takes-on-another-hedge-fund-manager-2012-12-11
OC,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — Sandy has hurt retailers who have had to close stores in the storm’s path, but home-improvement chains Home Depot Inc. and Lowe’s Cos., may be beneficiaries in the aftermath. On the first trading day after Sandy forced a two-day market shutdown, shares of Home Depot HD, -3.30% a Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -1.85%  component, rose 2.2%, while its smaller rival Lowe’s LOW, -4.53%  rose 3.3%, both leading the S&P Retail Index higher. Lumber Liquidators Holdings Inc. LL, -4.47%  , a specialty retailer of hardwood flooring, jumped 5%. Tractor Supply Co. TSCO, -4.35% a retailer of supplies for farmers and ranchers, rose 4.5%. Andria Cheng/MarketWatch Sandy's wrath leads resourceful New Yorkers heading uptown to find power at trees with outlets. Separately, Owens Corning OC, -1.14% a producer of residential and commercial building materials, jumped 6.8%. Retailers also are getting things back to normal as fast as they can. After having closed more than 100 stores on Monday, Lowe’s, for instance, said only one remains shut on Wednesday afternoon. Sears Holdings Corp. SHLD, -3.88%  , parent of Kmart and its namesake chain, said it has 66 stores closed on Wednesday due partly to area power outages, down from a peak of 187 on Monday. Home Depot had two locations still closed on Wednesday after having shut 44 by the end of Tuesday, spokeswoman Meghan King said. Analysts said the home-improvement retailers will benefit most from Sandy as consumers stocked up on batteries, flashlights and generators in the days leading up to the hurricane and will now return to buy supplies to repair damaged homes and property. See related story on retailers’ store closing and Sandy putting early bite on retailers’ holiday period. Home Depot and Lowe’s stocks, for instance, outperformed the S&P 500 SPX, -2.14%  by about 2% on average in the two weeks after Hurricane Katrina, Credit Suisse analyst Gary Balter said. “For those companies supporting clean-up activities, greater spending ahead should more than offset any impact from store closures,” said Goldman Sachs analysts in a report. “We believe that both Home Depot and Lowe’s generated substantial sales of generators, tape, pumps, and related equipment leading up to the storm.” Post-Sandy, Markets Re-Open For Business Goldman’s analyst Matthew Fassler estimated both chains will likely see a net benefit of 0.5 percentage point to 1 percentage point to their quarterly comparable-store sales. Other analysts agreed. Home Depot, Lowe’s, and Tractor Supply “are likely to see the most significant benefit,” said J.P. Morgan analyst Christopher Horvers, adding those retailers, which saw a boost in same-store sales by 0.6 percentage point to 1 percentage point from Hurricane Irene last year, could see an even bigger sales boost from Sandy. Those companies have a 21%, 20%, and 19% domestic store exposure each in Sandy’s path, he said. Andria Cheng/MarketWatch Downed trees are seen everywhere in Manhattan after Sandy. A downed tree claimed a car victim on 31st St. by Third Ave. Besides home-improvement chains, mass merchants also are likely seeing some benefit from Sandy, though that will be offset by lost Halloween and general merchandise sales from store closings, according to analysts. Both Wal-Mart Stores Inc. WMT, -3.21%  and rival Target Corp. TGT, -2.03%  dipped . Costco Wholesale Corp. closed up 1.5%. Retailers like Wal-Mart, Costco COST, -2.76%  and Target “selling consumables and food saw a noticeable stocking lift leading up to the hurricane,” J.P. Morgan’s Horvers said. “However, we estimate the impact will be to a lesser degree than the home improvement retailers given the lack of post hurricane spending and pull forward of some demand. Stores could be affected after the fact by closures and traffic impacts.” HURRICANE SANDY: RELATED STORIES • Northeast a ways away from normal • Rail, subways crawl back online • Sandy to reshape coastal areas • How to speed your damage claims • Big storms rarely dent economy • Slide show: Hurricane Sandy in pictures He estimated Target, Costco and Wal-Mart have roughly 19%, 17%, and 14% of U.S. store exposure to Sandy, respectively. Making up lost sales? For chains selling non-essential items, analysts had mixed views in terms of whether the lost sales are permanent or whether the chains can make up the business heading into the thick of the holiday season. “Office supply is a segment that may be adversely impacted by these devastating events as employees were not working or using office supplies and the segment generally does not experience catch-up demand,” said Credit Suisse’s Balter. Staples Inc. US:SPLS  has 35% of its locations in the storm-affected states, J.P. Morgan’s Horvers said. Its smaller rival, Office Depot Inc. ODP, -1.86%  , on the other hand, has an 8% exposure, he said. For dollar-store chain Dollar Tree Inc., which has a heavier discretionary merchandise focus compared to its rivals Dollar General Corp. and Family Dollar Stores Inc., analysts said it may have been hurt more because of lost Halloween sales. Shares of Dollar Tree DLTR, -1.21%  dipped 0.3% while those of its larger rival Dollar General DG, -1.30%  rose 1.5%. Family Dollar US:FDO  was little changed in mid-afternoon trading. For department-store chains, Sandy will likely hurt November same-store sales by 1.5 percentage points to 2.5 percentage points, even though some purchases may shift online, said Citigroup analyst Deborah Weinswig. She expects “a material adverse effect” for Macy’s Inc. and Saks Inc. in particular as Saks US:SKS  generates 22% of sales from its NYC flagship shop and Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s, generates 8% of its sales from its New York City area stores, the analyst said. She estimated November same-store sales at Saks to be hurt by as much as 4 percentage points and those at Macy’s M, -1.48%  to be dented by as much as 3 percentage points. Sandy’s impact will be felt in November’s results because retailers’ fiscal October ended last Saturday. Andria Cheng/MarketWatch National Guard trucks rolling up on Manhattan's Third Avenue in Sandy's path. Macy’s fell 1%. Saks inched up 0.4% after dipping earlier. J.C. Penney Co. JCP, +0.00% already seeing declining traffic and sales as it undergoes a merchandising change, fell 5.7%. Krissy Klinger, a meteorologist at consulting firm Weather Trends International, estimated about 15% of Penney’s stores were “significantly impacted” by the storm, with another 10% “marginally impacted.” For apparel retailers, the storm falling between fall and holiday season sales will likely make the overall impact not “as bad as some fear” for the apparel retailers, BMO’s analyst John Morris said “Retailers have plenty of time to make up for lost sales as the quarter progresses, especially with the key holiday periods still to come,” Morris said. However, because it’s a clearance period, chains including Aeropostale Inc., Abercrombie & Fitch Co., Pacific Sunwear of California Inc. and Express that have excess inventory will likely be hurt more, he said. Aeropostale US:ARO US:ARO  fell 2.7%. Abercrombie ANF, -1.78%  was flat. Pacific Sunwear US:PSUN  declined 1.2%. “Timing is retailers’ silver lining,” said Morgan Stanley analysts. “We anticipate Hurricane Sandy’s retail sales impact lasts about 8 days. Still, we believe November’s final two weeks are more critical than week one for most retailers — especially those participating in Black Friday/Saturday promotions.” More from MarketWatch Bloodbath for cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin sheds 10%, now down 40% year-to-date Why every investor should be terrified by the slide in Home Depot stock My husband sold his grandmother’s house and paid off our mortgage — now his family is threatening to sue","Oct 31, 2012 4:18 p.m. ET",1,Investors bet some stores will benefit from Sandy,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sandys-retail-winners-and-losers-2012-10-31
OC,"In the coming days, several stocks that are affected by hurricane Sandy will offer trading opportunities both on the long and the short side. Here is how to play them based on the historical data from previous storms. Insurance stocks Insurance stocks such as Travelers TRV, -2.77% Chubb CB, -3.18% and Allstate ALL, -0.84%  will be in play. It is too early to tell, but insured losses are likely to be in the range of $5-$10 billion. Property and casualty industry in the United States is capitalized at about $500 billion. Insured losses are likely to be under 2% of the capital. Further, some losses will be covered by reinsurance and typically water damage is not covered by insurance. In the past, every time insurance stocks have been hit in the wake of a storm, it has been a buying opportunity. Typically insurance companies succeed at raising rates after storms. Hardware stores Hardware stores such as Home Depot HD, -3.60% HD, -3.60%  and Lowe’s LOW, -4.80%  are obvious beneficiaries. In the past, these stocks gap up and overshoot on the upside. The real profitable opportunities have come from shorting the overshoot. Pumps and generators The generator company Generac Holdings GNRC, -2.96%  will be in play, as well as pump companies such as Xylem XYL, -1.90%  and Pentair PNR, -1.47% Often Briggs & Stratton BGG, -2.94%  also benefits as it makes small engines. These stocks can be played from the long side if a short-squeeze occurs. At the end of the short-squeeze, big profits will be made on the short side. Roofing and building-material stocks Roofing and building material stocks such as Beacon Roofing Supply BECN, -1.63% Eagle Materials EXP, -3.50% USG USG, -2.55%  and Owens Corning OC, -1.37%  can be traded from the long side if a short squeeze is developing. Ultimately big money is made by short selling the overshoot at the end of the short squeeze. Engineering and construction firms Engineering and construction firms such as Fluor FLR, -2.34%  and Granite Construction GVA, -3.44%  tend to benefit. These stocks should be traded only from the long side if they can be bought not much higher than Friday's close. A notable name is Quanta Services PWR, -2.47%  which provides infrastructure services related to electric power. If it turns out that there is extensive damage to the electrical grid, PWR is worthy of consideration along with EMCOR Group EME, -2.72%  and Integrated Electrical Services IESC, +2.81% Retail For most retail stocks it will be a wash. The sales they lost during the storm will be made up by increased sales in the near future. Macy’s M, -1.58%  has about 25% of its sales and Children’s Place PLCE, -1.81%  has about 28% of its sales in this geographical area. All but the most experienced nimble traders are well advised to use a proven method such as the ZYX Change Method when trading these stocks as it is easy to get whipsawed.

OC,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — U.S. home builders broke new ground in September at the fastest pace in more than four years and permits also rose sharply in the strongest sign yet that recovery in the construction trade is becoming firmly entrenched. Construction on new homes accelerated by 15% to an annual rate of 872,000 last month from a revised 758,000 in August, the Commerce Department said. The increase easily surpassed the 770,000 estimate of economists surveyed by MarketWatch. ECONOMY AND POLITICS | @MKTWEconomics  AFP/Getty Images A city-by-city look at home prices in May Tampa, Charlotte among gainers. • U.S. homeownership at 18-year low  Work on new single-family homes, which account for about three-quarters of the housing market, rose 11% last month. Construction on multi-dwelling units such as condos and townhouses climbed an even faster 25%, but that’s a category that can swing sharply from month to month and is thus less an indicator of overall housing demand. The number of permits requested, however, underscores the likelihood that the housing market’s recovery is finally for real after a nearly six-year slump. Building permits also shot up to a four-year high, rising 11.6% to an annual rate of 894,000. August’s permits were revised down slightly, to 801,000. Permits for single-family homes rose 6.7% to an annualized 545,000 rate last month, while multi-dwelling permits increased 20.3% to 349,000. Housing party is just getting started 0:05:19 In September, housing starts rose in all regions except the Northeast, with construction strongest in West and South. Both regions saw about a 20% jump in new construction. Before this year the nation’s construction industry had been stuck in its worst slump in the modern era, following the collapse of a housing bubble in 2006. Super-low interest rates, a modestly improved economy and a receding foreclosure crisis have all contributed to the upward shift in the demand for new homes. Yet even though the pace of construction is nearly 35% higher compared to a year ago, construction activity overall remains considerably shrunken from its pre-bubble heyday. Before the bust, housing starts surpassed 2 million a year; they would probably top 1.5 million annually if the economy were fully recovered. Going forward, home sales and construction could still be partly depressed by a slow growing U.S. economy and a high unemployment rate that limits the number of prospective buyers. The jobless rate is 7.8%. “How far can the rebound go with unemployment where it is?” asked Steve Blitz, chief economist of ITG Investment Research. “From our perspective, not much farther.” Related Topics U.S. Economy Federal Reserve Housing Indicators Employment Inflation PREV PAGE 1 2 NEXT PAGE","Oct 17, 2012 9:52 a.m. ET",23,U.S. home construction surges in September,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-home-construction-surges-in-september-2012-10-17

OC,"HOUSTON (MarketWatch) -- ConocoPhillips COP, -3.44% said Monday it is on track to spend $5 billion on share repurchases in the first half of the year and that it expects to spend the same amount in the second half. Speaking to analysts in a conference call, ConocoPhillips incoming Chief Executive Ryan Lance said the company expects to fund the share buybacks with the proceeds of its previously announced asset sale, which this year is estimated to be $8 billion to $10 billion. Lance, who will assume his new position when the spin-off of ConocoPhillips' refining arm is completed May 1, said the company is evaluating the disposition of assets that no longer are strategic for a stand-alone production company. The executive didn't specify the assets. ConocoPhillips is at the end of a three-year restructuring plan aimed at improving its finances and creating more value for shareholders. The plan includes a large scale asset sale and the spin-off of its refining, chemical and pipeline segments into an independent company, named Phillips 66. ConocoPhillips will become a pure oil and gas exploration and production firm. Lance confirmed ConocoPhillips plans to have an annual capital expenditure budget of about $15 billion through 2016 and compound annual production growth between 3% and 5% in the same period. Production growth is expected to be driven by the development of an oil-sand project in Canada, several shale fields the U.S., offshore projects in U.K.'s North Sea and Malasia and the Australian Pacific LNG project in Australia, the company said. Conoco also expects to grow its cash flow to $22 billion by 2016, up from about $16 billion this year, and it plans to spend about 20% to 25% of its annual cash flow on dividends. ConocoPhillips is looking for opportunities to acquire more shale properties internationally as it believes it can transfer the knowledge it has acquired developing unconventional fields in the U.S. overseas, Lance said. Conoco currently has shale assets in Poland. Separately, ConocoPhillips also announced Monday the names of the future board of directors for Phillips 66. Greg Garland, who previously was named president and chief executive of the company, will serve as chairman of the board. He was previously CEO of Chevron Phillips Chemical. Other directors include: J. Brian Ferguson, who was chairman and CEO of Eastman Chemical Co. EMN, -2.91% and currently serves on the boards of Owens Corning OC, -1.57% and NextEra Energy Inc. NEE, -0.58% ; William R. Loomis Jr., who has been an independent financial advisor since 2009 and currently serves on the boards of Pacific Capital Bancorp PCBC, -0.86% and Limited Brands Inc. LTD, +0.52% and is also a senior advisor to Lazard LLC LAZ, -2.05% and China International Capital Corporation; John E. Lowe, who currently serves as assistant to the CEO of ConocoPhillips and serves on the board of Agrium Inc.; Harold W. McGraw III, who currently serves as chairman, president and CEO of The McGraw-Hill Cos. MHP, +0.00% ; Glenn F. Tilton, chairman of the Midwest of J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, -2.72% and was previously chairman and CEO of United Airlines Inc.; and Victoria J. Tschinkel, chairwoman of 1000 Friends of Florida. She currently serves on the board of ConocoPhillips. All elections will be effective at the completion of ConocoPhillips' spinoff, the company said.

OC,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Among the stocks that could see active trade in Wednesday’s session are Hartford Financial Services Group Inc., Weight Watchers International Inc. and Zynga Inc.

Hartford Financial HIG, -2.72%  issued a response late Tuesday to hedge fund billionaire John Paulson’s proposal that the company spin off its property-and-casualty business from its life-insurance business as a way to improve shareholder value. “We recognize there are potential benefits to a separation of the P&C and life companies. ... While there are challenges to successfully executing a separation, we welcome Paulson’s views and look forward to continued dialogue with him and other shareholders. We are evaluating the company’s strategy and business portfolio with the goal of delivering shareholder value. We remain objective and pragmatic about the best ways to achieve this goal,” the Hartford, Conn.-based company said. Separating the two businesses, Paulson said in a letter to Chairman, President and Chief Executive Liam McGee, would result in an expanded multiple on book value. Paulson also estimated that if the two businesses were separately traded, they would have a value of $32 a share, or more than 60% higher than the share price at the close of Tuesday’s regular session. Paulson & Co. holds an 8.4% stake in Hartford Financial. Along with reporting 2011 results and issuing its financial forecast for 2012, Weight Watchers WTW, +0.27%  said it plans a “modified Dutch auction” tender offer next week for up to $720 million in common stock. The tender would be set in a range from not less than $72 a share and not greater than $83. It’s expected to remain open for at least 20 business days. In light of the impending tender, the New York-based company also announced an agreement to purchase shares from majority stockholder Artal Holdings so that the number of Weight Watchers shares that the Luxembourg company owns will hold steady at about 52% of outstanding common. If the tender is fully subscribed, Weight Watchers said it would buy back some $1.5 billion of common stock in all including Artal. Based on the number of outstanding shares as of Monday, this would mean a reduction of nearly 25% to slightly more than 28%. Weight Watchers said it anticipates using new borrowings under an amended and extended version of its existing credit facilities to fund the repurchases. Aflac Inc. AFL, -2.31%  said it entered into agreements to swap into Japanese yen the $750 million in dollar-denominated senior notes that the Columbus, Ga.-based insurer issued Feb. 10. The agreements cover $400 million of 5-year fixed-rate notes as well as $350 million of 10-year fixed-rate notes. The swap arrangement “significantly lowers the effective interest rate on the senior notes ... and provides future flexibility with our capital position,” said President and Chief Financial Officer Kriss Cloninger in a statement. Rite Aid Corp. RAD, -3.27%  said it expects to close Feb. 27 on an offering of $481 million of 9.25% senior notes due 2020. Net proceeds will be used in connection with the company’s tender offer for outstanding 8.625% senior notes due 2015 and a related consent solicitation, the Camp Hill, Pa.-based drugstore chain said. Rite Aid also said it will call for redemption any of the 8.625% notes due 2015 not duly tendered. The board of Foot Locker Inc. FL, -3.25%  approved a $400 million program for repurchasing common stock. The program, set to run through January 2015, replaces the New York-based retailer’s previous $250 million buyback program. The board also cleared a 9% increase in the quarterly dividend, to 18 cents a share from 16.5 cents previously. It’s payable April 27 to stockholders of record as of April 13, Foot Locker said. Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. ALNY, -17.23%  priced an offering of 7.5 million common shares at $10.75 each, the Cambridge, Mass.-based company said. The public offering’s expected to close Feb. 21. All of the shares up for sale are being offered by Alnylam, which had about 42.7 million weighted average common shares outstanding in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Underwriters will have a 30-day option to buy up to 1.05 million additional shares if demand warrants. The board of PolyOne Corp. POL, -3.32%  approved a 25% increase in the company’s quarterly dividend, to 5 cents a share. It’s payable April 5 to holders of record as of March 14, the Cleveland-based supplier of specialized polymer materials said. The board of Sigma-Aldrich Corp. SIAL  voted to increase its quarterly dividend by 11%, to 20 cents a share. The dividend’s payable March 15 to holders of record as of March 1, the St. Louis-based life-sciences and technology company said. Tuesday earnings recap Issuing its first financial results as a public company, Zynga ZNGA, -3.55%  reported a fourth-quarter net loss of $435 million, or $1.22 a share. The San Francisco-based games company closely associated with Facebook earned $43 million, or 5 cents a share, in the final three months of 2010.

OC,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — U.S. homebuilder stocks swooned on Tuesday after the year’s first Case-Shiller Index showed prices had weakened almost 4% from already anemic year-ago levels, but the sector was still on course to finish January among the market’s top performers. U.S. house prices dropped sharply in November to mark the third straight drop, according to index’s January data. The S&P/Case-Shiller 20-city composite home price index dropped 1.3% to take the year-on-year drop to 3.7%. Construction on a new subdivision of homes in San Marcos, California. The declines were broad, with only one city, Phoenix, managing a monthly gain. On a year-on-year basis, only hard-hit Detroit and Washington D.C. managed annual gains. Read MarketWatch coverage of the latest home price data Shares of Meritage Homes MTH, -6.41%  was Tuesday’s biggest loser, hit by the double whammy of the home price data as well as its news today of a big loss. Meritage’s fourth-quarter loss widened sharply on write-downs, mostly related to the winding down of its Las Vegas operations, though the home builder reported stronger home closings and orders. The company, which does much of its business in Texas, where tighter lending regulations shielded the housing market from the bubble and bust, and the energy sector has bolstered the economy. However, the Arizona-based home builder’s markets also include some of the hardest hit by the sector downturn. But there were some positive signs in the report. Revenue increased 15% to $246 million, although analysts polled by Thomson Reuters most recently projected revenue of $249 million. The broadest measure of the industry’s performance reflected today’s weakness, with the iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index Fund ITB, -4.10%  shedding 1.9% while the rival SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF XHB, -3.60%  surrendered 1.3%. Both the major sector-tracking ETFs are up for the month of January, with the IBB posting a 10% gain this month, while the XHB has added 9.3%. Builder KB Home tops the best performers so far this year with a 35.5% gain in January. Wallboard maker USG Corp USG, -2.40%  is the second best performer with a 27.3% month-to-date gain, while builder PulteGroup Inc. PHM, -4.90%  rounds out the top 3 monthly gainers, with an 18.6% jump. Fully half of the components of the ITB have posted better-than-10% gains this month. The housing sector was crippled by the global financial crisis that wiped out trillions of dollars of homeowners’ equity and quashed demand for new homes. Many homeowners left under water either walked away from their homes or had them foreclosed, exacerbating the problem for builders by increasing the supply of homes just as prices sank. Even now, with mortgage rates at historic lows, many owners would prefer to fix up their existing houses rather than trade up, having once been burned by the market. Home improvement spending is expected to improve in 2012, as the economy gets better and the housing market shows signs of recovery, according to a measure from the Remodeling Futures Program at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University. Read about the study, on MarketWatch Indeed that factor itself is driving much of the gain in the homebuilder sector ETFs, which include along with wallboard firm USG other materials providers like Masco Corp MAS, -3.29%  , Owens Corning OC, -1.77%  , Eagle Materials EXP, -3.73%  and Beacon Roofing Supply BECN, -1.62%  , which are all up by strong double-digit percentages in January.

OC,"Owens Corning OC, -1.23% first-quarter earnings declined by half, falling short of analysts' estimates, as the company's building-materials segment saw sales and earnings drop. ""Owens Corning delivered profit in line with our expectations for the first quarter driven by continued strong performance in the composites and roofing businesses,"" said Chairman and Chief Executive Mike Thaman. The maker of building materials had suffered from slumping demand during the economic downturn as construction tumbled, though last spring, many construction-materials makers saw a boost from a first-time homebuyer tax credit that spurred the housing market. The company's composites business--less tied to the U.S. housing market--has been its revenue engine of late. Owens Corning reported a profit of $24 million, or 19 cents a share, down from $48 million, or 38 cents, a year earlier.

OC,"SUGAR LAND, Texas (MarketWatch) — Backed by the potential for margins to widen and deal activity to provide abnormal returns, the leadership of chemical stocks seems sustainable. INVESTING COMMENTARY IN TRADING DECK Back to 1987 for stocks? Our Trading Deck has been home to a spirited debate over whether we're in for a crash. • L.A. Little: Don't worry | Michael Gayed: Worry • The warning signs of a 1987-style crash • Hulbert: Stocks as overvalued as at 2007 high Selected groups in the consumer discretionary and technology sectors like auto and computers led the way in 2009 as stock prices started to recover from the Great Recession. In 2010, the leadership shifted to groups like transportation. In recent months, stock prices in groups like auto, computers, and transportation have sputtered. The chemicals group is different in this regard. Shares here performed well in both 2009 and 2010 and they continue to fare well in 2011. Over the past year, the Dow Jones Chemicals Titans 30 Index DJACHE  is up 34% while the actively managed Fidelity Select Chemicals Fund FSCHX, +2.19%  is up 36% compared to the 12% advance of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index SPX, -2.12% as of Wednesday. Looking For Gold Pullback? Wait For Summer With industry margins likely to widen and deal activity adding spice, chemical company stocks have a few things going for them that can help them sustain their leadership. Industry profits poised to rise Chemical companies cut costs to the bone during the downturn. With the economy now growing, product demand in individual industry segments is increasing. The resulting operating leverage is helping chemical companies widen their margins. Agricultural chemicals: The secular forces of global population growth and higher per-capita income in emerging economies are lifting commodity crop prices. The United Nations reports that global food costs are at record levels. High crop prices provide significant incentive for farmers to increase acreage and yields. The U.S. Department of Agriculture recently stated that U.S. corn acreage this year would be second highest in 67 years. Fertilizer producers like Potash Corporation POT, -2.17%  and Agrium AGU  as well as seed developers like Monsanto MON, -0.17%  and DuPont DD, +0.94%  stand to benefit from the drive to increase farm output. Petrochemicals and plastics: Demand for petrochemicals and plastics is rising from growth in emerging markets and recovery of the auto industry. About the author: Sam Subramanian founded independent investment research firm AlphaProfit Investments in 2003. AlphaProfit publishes the monthly AlphaProfit Sector Investors' Newsletter and AlphaProfit Fund Investors' Guide.  alphaprofit.com Global capacity utilization for ethylene production, a bellwether for plastics manufacture, is forecasted to increase to 90% by 2013 from 84% in 2009. The automotive industry accounts for 10% of U.S. chemical industry demand. Plastics manufacture should receive a boost as global auto demand approaches 76 million units. Dow Chemical DOW, -0.77% BASF Corp. BASFY, -1.81%  and LyondellBasell Industries LYB, -1.81%  are among the world’s top petrochemicals and plastics producers. Ample supply of shale natural gas particularly in the U.S. should help their margins. Specialty chemicals and building materials: Specialty chemical stocks typically tend to perform well in early to mid-cycle phases of economic recoveries as demand increases to drive volume growth. Solutia SOA, -1.06% which makes various chemical and engineered materials used in consumer and industrial applications, is well-positioned to benefit from increasing global construction activity. Building products manufacturer U.S. Gypsum USG, -1.88% roofing products manufacturer Owens Corning OC, -1.23% and paint manufacturers Sherwin Williams SHW, -1.61%  and Valspar VAL, +0.00% too can fare well in varying degrees. Deal activity adds to investment appeal Deal activity in the chemical industry is continuing at a healthy pace as valuation metrics are attractive and companies seek to grow revenue. Legendary investor Warren Buffett is seeing value in chemical companies. Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -2.51%  recently announced that it is acquiring Lubrizol LZ  for $9 billion. Earlier, DuPont offered to buy Denmark’s Danisco for $6 billion to expand into biofuels and food enzymes. Air Products & Chemicals APD, -1.08%  went after Airgas ARG, +0.00%  in hot pursuit until the latter succeeded in staying independent by getting court approval of its poison pill provision. Investing in the chemicals group There are several options available for investors to play the chemicals group. Among mutual funds, several index and actively managed funds invest in the materials sector. However, when it comes to the chemicals group in particular, Fidelity Select Chemicals is the only pure-play mutual fund that focuses on this group. In the exchange-traded funds space, there are no pure-pay chemical ETFs. However, several basic materials and agriculture ETFs can work as suitable proxies since many of them have 40% or more of their assets invested in chemical stocks.

OC,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Exchange-traded funds that concentrate on residential-construction stocks may see activity pick up this week as investors digest the Federal Open Market Committee's latest decision on interest rates as well as several key pieces of economic and housing data. Also, home builders Lennar Corp. LEN, -4.48% and KB Home KBH, -2.65% are expected to report second-quarter financial results on Thursday and Friday, respectively. SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF XHB, -3.29% and iShares Dow Jones U.S. Home Construction Index Fund ITB, -3.65% are volatile sector ETFs that tap the stock market to provide exposure to residential construction. However, they have key differences and some of the top holdings may surprise investors -- a reminder not to judge a book by its cover when it comes to ETFs and mutual funds. In terms of performance, both ETFs have generally followed the overall market in 2010 -- hitting a peak in April followed by choppy trading since. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF, the bigger and higher-volume fund, was off 7.1% for the three months ended Monday, according to FactSet Research. Builder stocks have traded lower on weak recent housing data and on concerns about a double dip in home prices after government tax credits for buyers expire. Housing starts fell 10% in May, with potential ramifications for growth in gross domestic product during the second quarter, while the builder confidence index took a tumble in June. ""With the weak May starts and permits data it is increasingly likely that residential investment will be a drag on second-quarter GDP and possibly the third quarter as well,"" wrote PNC economists in a June 16 report. ""We do expect builder confidence to slowly improve as we emerge from a long hot summer in housing markets into the fourth quarter when market fundamentals are expected to improve."" Still, major hurdles for the housing market include high inventory levels and foreclosures as many borrowers remain hamstrung by a soft U.S. jobs market. The move lower in builder stocks may reflect those challenges. Aside from the closely followed statement on interest rates and the economy to be issued by Federal Reserve policy makers on Wednesday, investors will also get reports this week on U.S. home sales. The National Association of Realtors on Tuesday said existing home sales fell more than 2% in May. See full story on the resale market. On Friday, the Commerce Department reports a revised projection for growth in first-quarter GDP. Builder stocks could see volatility tick up as these reports cross the wires. Despite its name, SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF is far from a pure play on the sector. The fund's top five holdings are Tempur Pedic International Inc. TPX, -2.56% A.O. Smith Corp. AOS, -2.88% Mohawk Industries Inc. MHK, -2.64% Owens Corning OC, -1.52% and Aaron's Inc. AAN, -0.33% The ETF does own traditional builders such as NVR Inc. NVR, +3.62% Ryland Group Inc. RYL and others, but most of the stocks are consumer and industrials companies linked to housing. A spokeswoman for State Street Global Advisors, the portfolio manager, didn't immediately return a call seeking comment Tuesday morning. The ETF's iShares competitor is targeted more specifically to builders, although home-improvement retailers Home Depot Inc. HD, -3.64% and Lowe's Cos. LOW, -4.73% rank among the fund's top 10 holdings. Fitch Solutions on Tuesday said despite signs the housing recovery is underway, credit default swap spreads have widened significantly at Lennar and KB Home, which report earnings later this week. ""Lennar CDS is 44% wider, while CDS on KB Home have widened 55% over a three-month period,"" Fitch said. ""Both companies have underperformed the broader household goods sector."" The higher costs of insuring against a Lennar default signal ""continued distress perceived in the credit markets,"" it added.

OC,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- David Brown, chief market strategist for Sabrient Systems, says it's time for investors to be ""very, very careful, [but] a time to be nibbling"" at some great individual stocks available at a discount. In an interview with Chuck Jaffe, MarketWatch senior columnist, Brown said that while the market's decline has boosted the value score on many securities, an appropriate reaction to current market conditions is to be nervous about just what comes out as a ""buy"" and to focus instead on stocks rated as a ""strong buy."" Brown said the energy and materials sectors look promising, but anyone concerned about a long recession might focus instead on health care and consumer staples companies. He said that industrials and technology stocks could be on the ""outside looking in"" for any market rebound. During his appearance on ""Your Money with Chuck Jaffe,"" Brown followed through on that, labeling several energy stocks as buys, but saving his highest praise for a few strong buys, notably in shipping stocks. Brown put the ""strong buy"" label on Excel Maritime Carriers EXM, -5.77% -- which he said is the sixth-highest rated stock in his firm's database of 6,000 securities -- along with Frontline FRO, +0.11% and LDK Solar LDK Graham Corp. GHM, -2.01% is also one of his favorite picks, and Brown said he considers it a strong buy, although he noted that on Sabrient's proprietary scale it is currently rated as only a buy, due to a thin following of analysts. If just one more analyst tracked the company and confirmed what appears to be a healthy financial future, Brown said the stock would earn the strong buy label. Brown put several other stocks on the buy list, noting that they are good enough to purchase based on the Sabrient model. Those issues include BP Prudhoe Bay Royalty Trust BPT, +1.88% Arch Coal ACI, -0.18% and Regions Financial RF, -3.07% As for stocks to sell, Brown suggested that investors jettison James River Coal JRCC Owens Corning OC, -1.85% and Brookfield Asset Management BAM, -1.05% He labeled GT Solar SOLR, -7.14% and McDermott International MDR, -4.76% as ""holds,"" although he liked the prospects for both issues and noted that MDR was teetering on the brink of becoming a buy based on several factors that seem to be turning positive for the company.

OC,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) - Owens Corning OC, -2.61% on Thursday reported third-quarter net income of $112 million, or 86 cents a share. On an adjusted basis, it earned 40 cents a share. Net sales fell to $1.27 billion from $1.39 billion. The Toledo, Ohio-based company, which recently emerged from bankruptcy, said third-quarter results reflected continued weakness of the U.S. new residential construction market, partially offset by stronger global markets in its composites business. As part of Owens Corning's annual operations planning, the company said it is evaluating various cost-reduction projects to deliver significant savings in operating and corporate costs. These projects include capacity and job cuts, elimination of operational costs, and reduced general corporate expenses. Some of these cost-reduction projects have begun, Owens Corning said. The majority of the projects are expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter, resulting in a leaner cost structure that better positions the company to compete in a weaker housing market in 2008. This cost-reduction initiative is intended to reduce company-wide operating costs by about $100 million. The company no longer believes that it will surpass its earlier EBIT guidance from continuing operations of $365 million. Based on the deeper and prolonged weakness in demand for building materials in the U.S., the company now believes $335 million is a more appropriate estimate for 2007 adjusted EBIT from continuing operations.","Nov 1, 2007 7:46 a.m. ET",1,"Owens Corning posts profit, sees weak U.S. housing market",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/owens-corning-posts-profit-sees-weak-us-housing-market

PartyGaming warns 2007 profit will be below expectations (2:42 AM ET) LONDON (MarketWatch) -- Online gambling company PartyGaming(UK:PRTY)on Wednesday warned that its 2007 earnings before tax and one-off items would be ""significantly below"" the current market consensus, due to higher-than-expected distribution costs. The group said costs were driven higher by a sharp rise in players, with customer sign-ups jumping to 233,900 from 108,000 a year earlier. It added, however, that the increase in active players should lead to higher growth in 2008 and beyond. The firm said revenue for the quarter rose 26% to $94.8 million. PartyGaming also said it had seen a drop in yield per player per day as some of its high value players have been lost to competitor sites that continue to accept U.S. customers.

Profit at the corporate and retail banking arm rose 31% due to higher net interest income. Credit Suisse said its wealth management business generated net new assets of 15.2 billion francs, representing an annualized quarterly growth rate of 7.8%.

That was done after an accident at its Number One furnace, and it's holding its annual sales forecast of around 980,000 to 1 million ounces of platinum. A longer-than-usual Christmas and one-day wildcat strike at Marikana also affected results, Lonmin said. It's lifting its interim dividend by 22% to 55 cents a share.

OC,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Owens Corning OC, -3.12% Wednesday reported earnings of $7.7 billion for the three months ended Dec. 31, up from $338 million in the year-ago equivalent period. The latest figures include gains related to the settlement of certain asbestos liabilities and fresh-start accounting adjustments stemming from the company's emergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. On an adjusted basis, excluding items, the company posted earnings from operations of $143 million for the three-month period, which it designated as its fiscal fourth quarter, down 4% from $149 million in last year's period. Sales fell 14% in the quarter to $1.48 billion from $1.71 billion a year earlier. It attributed the sales decline to continued weakness in U.S. housing starts and a lack of storm-related demand for roofing products. In addition, Owens Corning, which is based in Toledo, Ohio, disclosed plans to evaluate strategic options for siding solutions business and the Fabwel unit of its composites business. This decision follows the company's announcement late Tuesday of a joint venture with Saint-Gobain to combine their reinforcements and composites businesses. The joint venture is to be 60% owned by Owens and 40% owned by Saint-Gobain with Owens Corning holding an option to purchase Saint-Gobain's minority stake. That deal is expected to close in mid-2007. Also, Owens Corning said its board has approved the buyback of up to 5% of its outstanding common stock.

OC,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- For manufacturers, the outcome of mid-term elections reduces the chance that issues near and dear to industrial America's heart - free trade agreements, new energy exploration, asbestos-suit limits and, for wood companies, a timber tax cut -- will make it into law, analysts said Wednesday. On the plus side for many export-driven firms, a Democrat-controlled Congress could heighten pressure on the Bush administration to lean on China to revalue its currency higher. And it could further open the federal spigots for subsidies and incentives to develop biofuels, a boost to agricultural and chemical firms that make up the growing ethanol industry, analysts said. On Wednesday, returns from the Tuesday election showed Democrats regaining control of the House after 12 years in the minority. Democrats moved to controlling 50 seats in the 100-member Senate, with one seat still undecided. See full story. Shares of industrial firms had a mixed reaction to changes in the electoral slate. The Dow Jones Industrial Average INDU, -0.10% closed up nearly 20 points to 12,177. Also gaining, the Amex Oil Index XOI, -3.19% rose 16 points to 1,167, and alternative energy shares rallied sharply. But the SIG Steel Producers Index STQX, -0.85% fell less than a point. Defense stocks like Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, -2.56% retreated. Losing majority control of the Congress will likely hinder the administration's efforts to ink tariff-slashing agreements with U.S. trading partners, said Thomas Duesterberg, president of Manufacturers Alliance/MAPI, a trade and policy group. Some Democrat lawmakers campaigned on the position that expanded free trade lost U.S. manufacturing jobs. ""There is a growing sentiment in the country, which may have contributed to the outcome of some of the races, that free trade is not always in the interest of the U.S.,"" said Duesterberg. ""I think you'll see a slowdown in the administration's push for expanded free trade,"" he said. The U.S. is currently negotiating an accord with South Korea that would reduce tariffs on imports and exports, from auto parts to agricultural products. The administration has also been pushing for resolution of the Doha round of talks at the World Trade Organization. Duesterberg also sees more calls on China to raise the value of its yuan currency -- which manufacturers have complained Beijing is keeping unfairly low to boost exports. ""This new congress may put more pressure on the administration to work with the Chinese to resolve this,"" he said. Asbestos, oil Federal asbestos legislation, which would limit the liabilities facing former sellers of the cancer-causing building material, is also likely to resist continued industry pushes for its passage. Earlier this year, Congress failed to pass an asbestos bill. ""Asbestos reform looks dead (again),"" noted JPMorgan paper and packaging analyst Claudia Shank. ""With the gains made by Democrats yesterday, we believe the chances of any meaningful asbestos bill passing have been significantly reduced,"" Shank said in a note to investors, adding this reduced focus will probably have no ""major implications"" for the sector. Owens Corning, Inc. OC, -3.01% Sealed Air Corp. SEE, -2.87% and Crown Holdings Inc. CCK, -2.50% could be affected by an asbestos bill. Democrat control of the House may also stymie further efforts to overturn bans on new domestic oil drilling and exploration. And it may increase calls for a windfall tax on oil-firm profits. ""Energy companies will also be in for a rougher ride, and may face hearings to investigate price levels,"" said Global Insight economist Nigel Gault. During the past term, Republican lawmakers have tried and failed to pass bills that would open new oil and gas drilling in offshore locations like California's coast and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Less access to new sources of oil and natural gas is bad news for manufacturers, particularly chemical companies, that rely on fossil fuels to run plants and make goods, said MAPI's Duesterberg. Alternative energy, timber tax But those involved in producing ethanol and other non-fossil fuels could benefit, says BB&T Capital Markets' chemicals analyst Frank Mitsch. ""Potentially there could be even greater federal monies spent promoting biofuels,"" he said. That could help firms corn seeds and other products used to make ethanol. Shares in alternative energy firms like VeraSun VSE and Aventine Renewable Energy AVR, -5.95% rallied Wednesday. Archer Daniels Midland ADM, -3.08% a big producer of corn for ethanol, jumped 6.6% to $35.73. For wood-products companies, sought-after legislation that would reduce the tax rates for some companies on earnings from timberland also becomes more unlikely, says JPMorgan's Claudia Shank. ""With the shift in Congressional power and Democrats likely to need all the tax revenue they can get, we believe the odds of near-term timber tax reform have been reduced,"" she said. Companies that would have been benefited from timber tax legislation include Weyerhaeuser Co. WY, -1.34% Temple Inland Inc. TIN, +0.00% and MeadWestvaco Corp. MWV, +0.00% Wyerhaeuser rose 1.8%, Temple Inland gained 1% and MeadWestvaco rose 1.7%.

Full-year 2017 consolidated net sales were $6.4 billion, compared with $5.7 billion in 2016, an increase of 12%. Fourth-quarter 2017 net loss attributable to Owens Corning was $4 million, or $0.04 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $86 million, or $0.76 per diluted share, during the comparable quarter in 2016. Fourth-quarter 2017 adjusted earnings were $125 million, or $1.11 per diluted share, compared with $81 million, or $0.72 per diluted share, during the same period one year ago. Full-year 2017 net earnings were $289 million, or $2.55 per diluted share, compared with net earnings of $393 million, or $3.41 per diluted share, during 2016. Adjusted earnings in 2017 were $498 million, or $4.40 per diluted share, compared with $419 million, or $3.63 per diluted share, during 2016. Owens Corning had another great year. We were pleased by the continued momentum in our three businesses and the addition of Paroc and Foamglas to our portfolio, said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mike Thaman. In 2018, the company is again positioned to produce strong revenue and earnings growth with substantial free cash flow. Consolidated Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Results Owens Corning continued to perform at a very high level of safety in 2017, with a recordable incident rate of 0.50, a slight improvement over 2016. Reported earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) for fourth-quarter 2017 were $150 million, up from $136 million during the same period in 2016. Adjusted EBIT in fourth-quarter 2017 was $215 million, up from $157 million in 2016. Reported EBIT for full-year 2017 was $737 million, compared with $699 million during 2016. Adjusted EBIT in 2017 was $855 million, up from $746 million in 2016. The company generated record operating cash flow of $1.0 billion and record free cash flow of $679 million in 2017. The company converted adjusted earnings to free cash flow at a rate of 136%. During 2017, Owens Corning repurchased 2.3 million shares of its common stock for $142 million. As of the end of 2017, 7.5 million shares were available for repurchase under the current authorization. In fourth-quarter 2017, the company recorded $65 million in charges excluded from adjusted EBIT, primarily related to pension risk mitigation actions, an environmental provision for a closed site and costs associated with prior decisions in the Composites business. As a result of the U.S. tax reform legislation, the company recorded a one-time, non-cash charge of $82 million, producing a loss in the fourth quarter. Other Significant Matters On February 5, 2018, the company completed the acquisition of Paroc Group, a leading producer of mineral wool insulation in Europe, further broadening the product portfolio and expanding the geographic footprint of the Insulation business. The company issued $400 million of 30-year notes at 4.4% on January 23, 2018 in association with this transaction. On February 1, 2018, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.21 per common share, a 5% increase compared with the same period in the prior year. The dividend will be payable on April 3, 2018, to shareholders of record as of March 9, 2018. 2018 Outlook The company expects an environment consistent with consensus expectations for U.S. housing starts and global industrial production growth. In Roofing, the company expects growth in both the new construction and remodeling markets. Storm demand at historical averages would result in a mid-single digit decline of the overall asphalt shingle market. The components business is expected to continue to grow at a double-digit rate. In Composites, the company expects continued growth in the glass fiber market, driven by global industrial production growth. In 2018, the company expects EBIT improvement of about $20 million, with the benefit of market growth and improved pricing partly offset by accelerated inflation and higher rebuild costs. In Insulation, the company expects to deliver EBIT growth of about $150 million, primarily from the realization of previously implemented pricing actions, the 2018 benefit from Paroc and Foamglas, and improvement in the mineral wool business. This outlook does not include the potential benefit of additional price actions, primarily in the U.S. residential new construction business. The company estimates an effective tax rate of 26 percent to 28 percent, a six-point reduction from the 2017 guidance, as a result of tax reform. The company continues to expect a cash tax rate of 10 percent to 12 percent on adjusted pre-tax earnings, due to the companys U.S. tax net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards. The companys advantaged cash tax position is largely unchanged as a result of the tax reform. The company expects general corporate expenses to be between $140 million and $150 million in 2018. Capital additions in 2018 are expected to total approximately $500 million. Interest expense is expected to be between $125 million and $130 million.","Feb 26, 2018 6:46 p.m. ET",N/A,United States : Owens Corning Reports Fourth-Quarter and Full-Year 2017 Results,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/united-states-owens-corning-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2017-results-2018-02-26

This news release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These forward-looking statements are subject to risks, uncertainties and other factors and actual results may differ materially from those results projected in the statements. These risks, uncertainties and other factors include, without limitation: relationships with key customers; levels of residential and commercial construction activity; competitive and pricing factors; levels of global industrial production; demand for our products; industry and economic conditions that affect the market and operating conditions of our customers, suppliers or lenders; domestic and international economic and political conditions, including new legislation, policies or other governmental actions in the U.S. or elsewhere, including the impact of recent tax reform legislation and related actions, interpretations, and regulatory guidance on our financial condition and results of operations (including the assumptions we make related thereto); foreign exchange and commodity price fluctuations, our level of indebtedness; weather conditions; availability and cost of credit; availability and cost of energy and raw materials; issues involving implementation and protection of information technology systems; labor disputes; legal and regulatory proceedings, including litigation and environmental actions; our ability to utilize net operating loss carry-forwards; research and development activities and intellectual property protection; interest rate movements; uninsured losses; issues related to acquisitions, divestitures and joint ventures; achievement of expected synergies, cost reductions and/or productivity improvements; defined benefit plan funding obligations; price volatility in certain wind energy markets in the U.S.; and factors detailed from time to time in the company’s Securities and Exchange Commission filings. The information in this news release speaks as of February 5, 2018, and is subject to change. The company does not undertake any duty to update or revise forward-looking statements except as required by federal securities laws. Any distribution of this news release after that date is not intended and should not be construed as updating or confirming such information. This release contains references to certain “non-GAAP financial measures” as defined by the SEC, including earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”). Earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), when used outside of a segment profitability measure, is also a non-GAAP measure. Management believes these measures, and exclusions from GAAP therein, provide useful information to investors. Non-GAAP measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the corresponding GAAP measures. When the company provides forward-looking expectations for non-GAAP measures, the most comparable GAAP measures and a reconciliation between the non-GAAP expectations and the corresponding GAAP measures are generally not available without unreasonable effort due to the variability, complexity and limited visibility of the adjusting items that would be excluded from the non-GAAP measures in future periods. The variability in timing and amount of adjusting items could have significant and unpredictable effects on future GAAP results.
