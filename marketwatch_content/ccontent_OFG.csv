OFG,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The accounting and reporting policies followed by Oriental conform with GAAP and general practices within the financial services industry. Oriental's significant accounting policies are described in detail in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements and should be read in conjunction with this section. Critical accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions, which involve significant judgment about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and that involve a high degree of subjectivity. These estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce actual results that differ from those estimates. The following MD&A section is a summary of what management considers Oriental's critical accounting policies and estimates. Fair Value Measurement of Financial Instruments Oriental currently measures at fair value on a recurring basis its trading assets, available-for-sale securities, derivatives, mortgage servicing rights and contingent consideration. Occasionally, Oriental may be required to record at fair value other assets on a nonrecurring basis, such as loans held-for-sale, impaired loans held-in-portfolio that are collateral dependent and certain other assets. These nonrecurring fair value adjustments typically result from the application of lower of cost or fair value accounting or write-downs of individual assets. Oriental categorizes its assets and liabilities measured at fair value under the three-level hierarchy. The level within the hierarchy is based on whether the inputs to the valuation methodology used for fair value measurement are observable. Oriental requires the use of observable inputs when available, in order to minimize the use of unobservable inputs to determine fair value. The inputs or methodologies used for valuing securities are not necessarily an indication of the risk associated with investing in those securities. The amount of judgment involved in estimating the fair value of a financial instrument depends upon the availability of quoted market prices or observable market parameters. In addition, it may be affected by other factors such as the type of instrument, the liquidity of the market for the instrument, transparency around the inputs to the valuation, as well as the contractual characteristics of the instrument. If listed prices or quotes are not available, Oriental employs valuation models that primarily use market-based inputs including yield curves, interest rate curves, volatilities, credit curves, and discount, prepayment and delinquency rates, among other considerations. When market observable data is not available, the valuation of financial instruments becomes more subjective and involves substantial judgment. The need to use unobservable inputs generally results from diminished observability of both actual trades and assumptions resulting from the lack of market liquidity for those types of loans or securities. When fair values are estimated based on modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow models, Oriental uses assumptions such as interest rates, prepayment speeds, default rates, loss severity rates and discount rates. Valuation adjustments are limited to those necessary to ensure that the financial instrument's fair value is adequately representative of the price that would be received or paid in the marketplace. Management believes that fair values are reasonable and consistent with the fair value measurement guidance based on Oriental's internal validation procedure and consistency of the processes followed, which include obtaining market quotes when possible or using valuation techniques that incorporate market-based inputs. Refer to Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements for information on Oriental's fair value measurement disclosures required by the applicable accounting standard. At December 31, 2017, 99%, of the assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis used market-based or market-derived valuation methodology and, therefore, were classified as Level 1 or Level 2. Level 2 classified instruments, consisted primarily of U.S. Treasury securities, obligations of U.S. Government-sponsored entities, Puerto Rico or state-government obligations, including the political subdivision, most mortgage-backed securities (""MBS""), and collateralized mortgage obligations (""CMOs""), and derivative instruments. There were no transfers in and/or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 for financial instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016, and 2015. Oriental's policy is to recognize transfers as of the end of the reporting period. Trading Account Securities and Investment Securities Available-for-Sale The majority of the values for trading account securities and investment securities available-for-sale are obtained from third-party pricing services and are validated with alternate pricing sources when available. Securities not priced by a secondary pricing source are documented and validated internally according to their significance for Oriental's financial statements. Management has established materiality thresholds according to the investment class to monitor and investigate material deviations in prices obtained from the primary pricing service provider and the secondary pricing source used as support for the valuation results. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Oriental did not adjust any prices obtained from pricing service providers. Inputs are evaluated to ascertain that they consider current market conditions, including the relative liquidity of the market. When a market quote for a specific security is not available, the pricing service provider generally uses observable data to derive an exit price for the instrument, such as benchmark yield curves and trade data for similar products. To the extent trading data is not available, the pricing service provider relies on specific information including buy side clients, credit ratings, spreads to established benchmarks and transactions on similar securities, to draw correlations based on the characteristics of the evaluated instrument. If for any reason the pricing service provider cannot observe data required to feed its model, it discontinues pricing the instrument. During the year ended December 31, 2017, none of Oriental's investment securities were subject to pricing discontinuance by the pricing service providers. The pricing methodology and approach of our primary pricing service providers is concluded to be consistent with the fair value measurement guidance. Furthermore, management assesses the fair value of its portfolio of investment securities at least on a quarterly basis, which includes analyzing changes in fair value that have resulted in losses that may be considered other-than-temporary. Factors considered include, for example, the nature of the investment, severity and duration of possible impairments, industry reports, sector credit ratings, economic environment, creditworthiness of the issuers and any guarantees. Securities are classified in the fair value hierarchy according to product type, characteristics and market liquidity. At the end of each period, management assesses the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured. The fair value measurement analysis performed by Oriental includes validation procedures and review of market changes, pricing methodology, assumption and level hierarchy changes, and evaluation of distressed transactions. Refer to Note 27 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of Oriental's valuation methodologies used for the assets and liabilities measured at fair value. Interest on Loans and Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses Interest on loans is accrued and recorded as interest income based upon the principal amount outstanding. Non-accrual loans are those loans on which the accrual of interest is discontinued. When a loan is placed on non-accrual status, all previously accrued and unpaid interest is charged against income and the loan is accounted for either on a cash-basis method or on the cost-recovery method. Loans designated as non-accruing are returned to accrual status when Oriental expects repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest. The determination as to the ultimate collectability of the loan's balance may involve management's judgment in the evaluation of the borrower's financial condition and prospects for repayment. Refer to the MD&A section titled Credit Risk Management, particularly the Non-performing Assets sub-section, for a detailed description of Oriental's non-accruing and charge-off policies by major loan categories. One of the most critical and complex accounting estimates is associated with the determination of the allowance for loan and lease losses. The provision for loan losses charged to current operations is based on this determination. Oriental's assessment of the allowance for loan and lease losses is determined in accordance with accounting guidance, specifically guidance of loss contingencies in ASC Subtopic 450-20 and loan impairment guidance in ASC Section 310-10-35. For a detailed description of the principal factors used to determine the general reserves of the allowance for loan and lease losses and for the principal enhancements management made to its methodology, refer to Notes 1 and 7 to the consolidated financial statements. According to the loan impairment accounting guidance in ASC Section 310-10-35, a loan is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that the principal and/or interest are not going to be collected according to the original contractual terms of the loan agreement. Current information and events include ""environmental"" factors, such as existing industry, geographical, economic and political factors. Probable means the future event or events which will confirm the loss or impairment of the loan is likely to occur. The collateral dependent method is generally used for the impairment determination on commercial loans since the expected realizable value of the loan is based upon the proceeds received from the liquidation of the collateral property. For commercial properties, the ""as is"" value or the ""income approach"" value is used depending on the financial condition of the subject borrower and/or the nature of the subject collateral. In most cases, impaired commercial loans do not have reliable or sustainable cash flow to use the discounted cash flow valuation method. Appraisals may be adjusted due to their age, property conditions, geographical area or general market conditions. The adjustments applied are based upon internal information, like other appraisals and/or loss severity information that can provide historical trends in the real estate market. Discount rates used may change from time to time based on management's estimates. For additional information on Oriental's policy of its impaired loans, refer to Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. Oriental's management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a quarterly basis following a systematic methodology in order to provide for known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio. In developing its assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses, Oriental must rely on estimates and exercise judgment regarding matters where the ultimate outcome is unknown, such as economic developments affecting specific customers, industries or markets. Other factors that can affect management's estimates are the years of historical data to include when estimating losses, the level of volatility of losses in a specific portfolio, changes in underwriting standards, financial accounting standards and loan impairment measurement, among others. Changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers, in economic conditions, in historical loss experience and in the condition of the various markets in which collateral may be sold may all affect the required level of the allowance for loan losses. Consequently, the business, financial condition, liquidity, capital and results of operations could also be affected. A restructuring constitutes a ""troubled-debt restructuring"" (""TDR"") when Oriental separately concludes that the restructuring constitutes a concession and the debtor is experiencing financial difficulties. For information on Oriental's TDR policy, refer to Note 1 to the financial consolidated statements. Acquisition Accounting for Loans Oriental has acquired loans in two separate acquisitions, the BBVAPR Acquisition in December 2012 and the FDIC-assisted Eurobank acquisition in April 2010. Oriental accounted for both acquisitions under the accounting guidance of ASC Topic 805, Business Combinations, which requires the use of the purchase method of accounting. All identifiable assets and liabilities acquired were initially recorded at fair value. No allowance for loan and lease losses related to the acquired loans was recorded on the acquisition date as the fair value of the loans acquired incorporated assumptions regarding credit risk. Loans acquired were recorded at fair value in accordance with the fair value methodology prescribed in ASC Topic Because the FDIC agreed to reimburse Oriental for losses related to the acquired loans in the FDIC-assisted Eurobank transaction, subject to certain provisions specified in the agreements, an indemnification asset was recorded at fair value at the acquisition date. The indemnification asset was recognized at the same time as the indemnified loans, and is measured on the same basis, subject to collectability or contractual limitations. The shared-loss indemnification asset on the acquisition date reflected the reimbursements expected to be received from the FDIC, using an appropriate discount rate, which reflected counterparty credit risk and other uncertainties. On February 6, 2017, the Bank and the FDIC agreed to terminate the single family and commercial shared-loss agreements related to the FDIC assisted acquisition. The initial valuation of these loans and related indemnification asset required management to make subjective judgments concerning estimates about how the acquired loans would perform in the future using valuation methods, including discounted cash flow analyses and independent third-party appraisals. Factors that may significantly affect the initial valuation included, among others, market-based and industry data related to expected changes in interest rates, assumptions related to probability and severity of credit losses, estimated timing of credit losses including the timing of foreclosure and liquidation of collateral, expected prepayment rates, required or anticipated loan modifications, unfunded loan commitments, the specific terms and provisions of any shared-loss agreement, and specific industry and market conditions that may impact discount rates and independent third-party appraisals. For both acquisitions, Oriental considered the following factors as indicators that an acquired loan had evidence of deterioration in credit quality and was therefore in the scope of ASC 310-30: * Loans that were 90 days or more past due; * Loans that had an internal risk rating of substandard or worse substandard is consistent with regulatory definitions and is defined as having a well-defined weakness that jeopardizes liquidation of the loan; * Loans that were classified as nonaccrual by the acquired bank at the time of acquisition; and * Loans that had been previously modified in a troubled debt restructuring. Any acquired loans that were not individually in the scope of ASC 310-30 because they did not meet the criteria above were either (i) pooled into groups of similar loans based on the borrower type, loan purpose, and collateral type and accounted for under ASC 310-30 by analogy or (ii) accounted for under ASC 310-20 (Non-refundable fees and other costs). Acquired Loans Accounted for under ASC 310-20 (loans with revolving feature and/or acquired at a premium) Revolving credit facilities such as credit cards, retail and commercial lines of credit and floor plans which are specifically scoped out of ASC 310-30 are accounted for under the provisions of ASC 310-20. Also, performing auto loans with FICO scores over 660 acquired at a premium in the BBVAPR Acquisition are accounted for under this guidance. Auto loans with FICO scores below 660 were acquired at a discount and are accounted for under the provisions of ASC 310-30. The provisions of ASC 310-20 require that any differences between the contractually required loan payments in excess of Oriental's initial investment in the loans be accreted into interest income on a level-yield basis over the life of the loan. Loans acquired in the BBVAPR Acquisition that were accounted for under the provisions of ASC 310-20, which had fully amortized their premium or discount recorded at the date of acquisition, are removed from the acquired loan category. Loans accounted for under ASC 310-20 are placed on non-accrual status when past due in accordance with Oriental's non-accruing policy and any accretion of discount is discontinued. These assets were recorded at estimated fair value on their acquisition date, incorporating an estimate of future expected cash flows. Such fair value includes a credit discount which accounts for expected loan losses over the estimated life of these loans. Management takes into consideration this credit discount when determining the necessary allowance for acquired loans that are accounted for under the provisions of ASC 310-20. The allowance for loan and lease losses model for acquired loans accounted for under ASC 310-20 is the same as for the originated loan portfolio. Acquired Loans Accounted under ASC 310-30 (including those accounted for under ASC 310-30 by analogy) Oriental performed a fair market valuation of each of the loan pools, and each pool was recorded at a discount. Oriental determined that at least part of the discount on the acquired individual or pools of loans was attributable to credit quality by reference to the valuation model used to estimate the fair value of these pools of loans. The valuation model incorporated lifetime expected credit losses into the loans' fair valuation in consideration of factors such as evidence of credit deterioration since origination and the amounts of contractually required principal and interest that Oriental did not expect to collect as of the acquisition date. Based on the guidance included in the December 18, 2009 letter from the AICPA Depository Institutions Panel to the Office of the Chief Accountant of the SEC, Oriental has made an accounting policy election to apply ASC 310-30 by analogy to all of these acquired pools of loans as they all (i) were acquired in a business combination or asset purchase, The excess of expected cash flows from acquired loans over the estimated fair value of acquired loans at acquisition is referred to as the accretable discount and is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the acquired loans using the interest method. The difference between contractually required payments at acquisition and the cash flows expected to be collected at acquisition is referred to as the nonaccretable discount. The nonaccretable discount represents estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the acquired loans. Subsequent decreases to the expected cash flows require Oriental to evaluate the need for an addition to the allowance for loan losses. Subsequent improvements in expected cash flows result in the reversal of the associated allowance for loan losses, if any, and the reversal of a corresponding amount of the nonaccretable discount which Oriental then reclassifies as accretable discount that is recognized into interest income over the remaining life of the loan using the interest method. Oriental's evaluation of the amount of future cash flows that it expects to collect takes into account actual credit performance of the acquired loans to date and Oriental's best estimates for the expected lifetime credit performance of the loans using currently available information. Charge-offs of the principal amount on acquired loans would be first applied to the nonaccretable discount portion of the fair value adjustment. In accordance with ASC 310-30, recognition of income is dependent on having a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be collected. Oriental performs such an evaluation on a quarterly basis on both its acquired loans individually accounted for under ASC 310-30 and those in pools accounted for under ASC 310-30 by analogy. Cash flows for acquired loans individually accounted for under ASC 310-30 are estimated on a quarterly basis. Based on this evaluation, a determination is made as to whether or not Oriental has a reasonable expectation about the timing and amount of cash flows. Such an expectation includes cash flows from normal customer repayment, collateral value, foreclosure or other collection efforts. Cash flows for acquired loans accounted for on a pooled basis under ASC 310-30 by analogy are also estimated on a quarterly basis. For residential real estate, home equity and other consumer loans, cash flow loss estimates are calculated based on a model that incorporates a projected probability of default and loss. For commercial loans, lifetime loss rates are assigned to each pool with consideration given for pool make-up, including risk rating profile. Lifetime loss rates are developed from internally generated historical loss data and are applied to each pool. To the extent that Oriental cannot reasonably estimate cash flows, interest income recognition is discontinued. The unit of account for loans in pools accounted for under ASC 310-30 by analogy is the pool of loans. Accordingly, as long as Oriental can reasonably estimate cash flows for the pool as a whole, accretable yield on the pool is recognized and all individual loans within the pool - even those more than 90 days past due - would be considered to be accruing interest in Oriental's financial statement disclosures, regardless of whether or not Oriental expects any principal or interest cash flows on an individual loan 90 days or more past due. Oriental writes-off the loan's recorded investment and derecognizes the associated allowance for loan and lease losses for loans that exit the acquired pools. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, and attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply in the years in which the temporary differences are expected to be recovered or paid. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in earnings in the period when the changes are enacted. The calculation of periodic income taxes is complex and requires the use of estimates and judgments. Oriental has recorded two accruals for income taxes: A deferred tax asset should be reduced by a valuation allowance if based on the weight of all available evidence, it is more likely than not (a likelihood of more than 50%) that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be realized. The valuation allowance should be sufficient to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The determination of whether a deferred tax asset is realizable is based on weighting all available evidence, including both positive and negative evidence. The realization of deferred tax assets, including carryforwards and deductible temporary differences, depends upon the existence of sufficient taxable income of the same character during the carryback or carryforward period. The realization of deferred tax assets requires the consideration of all sources of taxable income available to realize the deferred tax asset, including the future reversal of existing temporary differences, future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards, taxable income in carryback years and tax-planning strategies. Management evaluates the realization of the deferred tax asset an entity by entity basis, since no consolidation is allowed in the income tax filing. For the evaluation of the realization of the deferred tax asset refer to Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Under PR Code, Oriental and its subsidiaries are treated as separate taxable entities and are not entitled to file consolidated tax returns. The PR Code provides a dividends-received deduction of 100% on dividends received from ""controlled subsidiaries"" subject to taxation in Puerto Rico. Changes in Oriental's estimates can occur due to changes in tax rates, new business strategies, newly enacted guidance, and resolution of issues with taxing authorities regarding previously taken tax positions. Such changes could affect the amount of accrued taxes. Oriental has made tax payments in accordance with estimated tax payments rules. Any remaining payment will not have any significant impact on liquidity and capital resources. The valuation of deferred tax assets requires judgment in assessing the likely future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the financial statements or tax returns and future profitability. The accounting for deferred tax consequences represents management's best estimate of those future events. Changes in management's current estimates, due to unanticipated events, could have a material impact on Oriental's financial condition and results of operations. Oriental establishes tax liabilities or reduces tax assets for uncertain tax positions when, despite its assessment that its tax return positions are appropriate and supportable under local tax law, Oriental believes it may not succeed in realizing the tax benefit of certain positions if challenged. In evaluating a tax position, Oriental determines whether it is more-likely-than-not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. . . .

OFG,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION The following discussion of Oriental's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the ""Selected Financial Data"" and Oriental's consolidated financial statements and related notes. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. Please see ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the ""2016 Form 10-K""), for discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. Oriental is a publicly-owned financial holding company that provides a full range of banking and financial services through its subsidiaries, including commercial, consumer, auto and mortgage lending; checking and savings accounts; financial planning, insurance and securities brokerage services; and corporate and individual trust and retirement services. Oriental operates through three major business segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury, and distinguishes itself based on quality service. Oriental has 48 branches in Puerto Rico and a subsidiary in Boca Raton, Florida. Oriental's long-term goal is to strengthen its banking and financial services franchise by expanding its lending businesses, increasing the level of integration in the marketing and delivery of banking and financial services, maintaining effective asset-liability management, growing non-interest revenue from banking and financial services, and improving operating efficiencies. Oriental's diversified mix of businesses and products generates both the interest income traditionally associated with a banking institution and non-interest income traditionally associated with a financial services institution (generated by such businesses as securities brokerage, fiduciary services, investment banking, insurance agency, and retirement plan administration). Although all of these businesses, to varying degrees, are affected by interest rate and financial market fluctuations and other external factors, Oriental's commitment is to continue producing a balanced and growing revenue stream. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies in ""Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" of our 2016 Form 10-K. In the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"" section of our 2016 Form 10-K, we identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition: * Loans and lease receivables * Allowance for loan and lease losses * Financial instruments We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions. Management has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies and has discussed its judgments and assumptions with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. During the third quarter of 2017, in the span of two weeks in September, hurricanes Irma and Maria caused catastrophic damages throughout Puerto Rico. Although the effect of the hurricanes on Oriental's loan portfolio is difficult to predict at this time, management performed an evaluation of the loan portfolios in order to assess the impact on repayment sources and underlying collateral that could result in additional losses. The framework for the analysis was based on our current ALLL methodology with additional considerations according to the estimated impact categorized as low, medium or high. From this impact assessment, additional reserve levels were estimated by increasing default probabilities (""PD"") and loss given default expectations (""LGD"") of each allowance segment. For commercial portfolios, Oriental contacted its clients to evaluate the impact of the hurricanes on their business operations and collateral. The impact was then categorized as follows: (i) low risk, for clients that had no business impact or relatively insignificant impact; (ii) medium risk, for clients that had a business impact on their primary or secondary sources of repayment, but had adequate cash flow to cover operations and to satisfy their obligations; or (iii) high risk, for clients that had potentially significant problems that affected primary, secondary and tertiary (collateral) sources of repayment. This criterion was used to model adjusted PDs and LGDs considering internal and external sources of information available to support our estimation process and output. For retail portfolios (residential mortgage, consumer and auto), management established assumptions based on the historical losses of each ALLL segment and then further adjusted based on parameters used as key risk indicators, such as the industry of employment (for all portfolios) and the location of the collateral (for residential loans). The documentation for the assessment considers all information available at the moment; gathered through visits or interviews with our clients, inspections of collaterals, identification of most affected areas and industries. Oriental will continue to assess the impact to our customers and our businesses as a result of the hurricanes and refine our estimates as more information becomes available. Other than these changes, there have been no material changes in the methods used to formulate these critical accounting estimates from those discussed in our 2016 Form 10-K.

The intensity and extent of damages caused by hurricane Maria, less than two weeks after hurricane Irma left over a million Puerto Rico residents without electric power, is unprecedented in Puerto Rico. Many areas and towns throughout Puerto Rico were devastated by hurricane Maria and at least 51 fatalities are attributed to this natural disaster. Over a month after the hurricanes, most of Puerto Rico remains without electricity, many businesses are unable to operate, and government authorities are still struggling to deliver emergency supplies and clean drinking water to many communities outside the San Juan metropolitan area. Further, payment and delivery systems, including the U.S. Post Office, were unable to operate for weeks after hurricane Maria and some are still subject to significant delays. In response to the magnitude of this natural disaster and its general adverse effects on our customers, we offered a moratorium to defer payments on our personal, auto, mortgage and commercial loan portfolios. Any eligible customer may decline the deferment by continuing to make its regularly scheduled loan payments. Our moratorium covers all personal and auto loan customers that are not over 89 days delinquent in their loans. It consists of an optional automatic deferment of three scheduled monthly payments of principal and interest. For any customer that does not opt out, the deferred payments are due and payable in three consecutive installments after the loan's maturity date. Such loans continue to accrue interest on their principal balances during the moratorium at their respective rates, and such customers are not charged late payment fees in connection with the deferment, nor is their credit history affected thereby. For commercial loans, we offered a one-month optional deferment in the payment of principal and interest for loans that are not over 30 days past due, and up to two additional one-month deferrals in certain cases. For conforming mortgage loans (Rural, VA, FNMA, FHA and FHLMC), we offered a three-month optional deferment of principal and interest due and payable in January 2018, and for credit card balances that were not over 29 days past due as of August 31, 2017, we offered a waiver of minimum payments for October, November and December 2017. * Net loss available to shareholders totaled $146 thousand. This compares to $13.6 million, or $0.30 per share fully diluted, in the second quarter of 2017 and $11.7 million, or $0.26 per share fully diluted, in the year ago quarter. * Based on preliminary assessments of the impact of the hurricanes on its credit portfolio, third quarter 2017 results included an additional loan loss provision of $27.0 million. * Tangible book value per common share was $15.92 and tangible common equity ratio was 11.26%, with common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 15.48%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 20.09%, and total risk-based capital ratio of 21.37%. Adjusted results of operations - Non-GAAP financial measures Oriental prepares its consolidated financial statements using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""U.S. GAAP"" or the ""reported basis""). In addition to analyzing Oriental's results on a reported basis, management monitors ""Adjusted net income"" of Oriental and excludes the impact of certain transactions on the results of its operations. During the third quarter of 2017, in the span of two weeks in September, hurricanes Irma and Maria caused catastrophic damages throughout Puerto Rico. Oriental has excluded the impact of these events for its ""Adjusted net income"". Adjusted net income is a non-GAAP financial measure. Management believes that Adjusted net income and other non-GAAP financial measures provides meaningful information about the underlying performance of Oriental's ongoing operations. Refer to the following table for a reconciliation of the reported results to the Adjusted net income and other non-GAAP financial measures for the quarter and nine-month period ended September 30, 2017. Non-GAAP financial measures used by Oriental may not be comparable to similarly named Non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies.

Adjusted net income available to shareholders totaled $18.8 million or $0.40 per share fully diluted. That's an increase of $0.10 per share or 33.0% from the second quarter of 2017 and of $0.14 or 53.8% from the year ago quarter. ? Return on average assets was 1.47% and return on average tangible common equity was 10.90% - 38 and 289 basis points higher, respectively, than the second quarter of 2017.

OFG,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION The following discussion of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the ""Selected Financial Data"" and the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. Please see ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the ""2016 Form 10-K""), for discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. The Company is a publicly-owned financial holding company that provides a full range of banking and financial services through its subsidiaries, including commercial, consumer, auto and mortgage lending; checking and savings accounts; financial planning, insurance and securities brokerage services; and corporate and individual trust and retirement services. The Company operates through three major business segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury, and distinguishes itself based on quality service. The Company has 48 branches in Puerto Rico and a subsidiary in Boca Raton, Florida. The Company's long-term goal is to strengthen its banking and financial services franchise by expanding its lending businesses, increasing the level of integration in the marketing and delivery of banking and financial services, maintaining effective asset-liability management, growing non-interest revenue from banking and financial services, and improving operating efficiencies. The Company's diversified mix of businesses and products generates both the interest income traditionally associated with a banking institution and non-interest income traditionally associated with a financial services institution (generated by such businesses as securities brokerage, fiduciary services, investment banking, insurance agency, and retirement plan administration). Although all of these businesses, to varying degrees, are affected by interest rate and financial market fluctuations and other external factors, the Company's commitment is to continue producing a balanced and growing revenue stream. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies in ""Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" of our 2016 Form 10-K. In the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"" section of our 2016 Form 10-K, we identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition: Loans and lease receivables We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions.

The Company reported $13.6 million, or $0.30 per share fully diluted, compared to $11.7 million, or $0.26 per share fully diluted, in the first quarter of 2017 and $10.9 million, or $0.25 per share fully diluted, in the year ago quarter. Puerto Rico municipality exposure reduced. The Company opportunistically sold a $38.0 million performing term loan with a municipality, resulting in a $4.3 million pre-tax loss. The sale reduced its exposure to this sector by approximately 27% from March 31, 2017, to $140.8 million after scheduled principal payments in July. Balance sheet de-levered further. The Company unwound a 1.48% $100.0 million repurchase agreement, in line with its strategy to reduce borrowings. Related to this, the Company sold $166.0 million of mortgage backed securities. These transactions resulted in a tax-advantaged gain of $6.9 million. Effective tax rate optimized. The Company now forecasts its 2017 effective tax rate to be 29.15% as compared to its previously stated 38% estimate. The new rate is similar to its 2016 rate and resulted in a $2.1 million beneficial adjustment to estimated income tax in the second quarter of 2017. Net interest margin (NIM) improved. Due to a significant reduction in the cost of borrowings and higher yields on variable rate commercial loans and on cash, NIM increased 8 basis points from the first quarter of 2017 to 5.18%. Credit quality and major performance ratios remained solid. The non-performing loan and total delinquency rates fell to the lowest levels in the last five quarters. Return on average assets was 1.09%, return on average tangible common stockholders' equity was 8.01%, and the efficiency ratio was 56.49%. Capital buildup continued. All major capital metrics advanced compared to the preceding and year ago quarters. Tangible book value per common share at $15.51 was up 1.2% and 3.7%, respectively, while tangible common equity ratio at 11.09% was up 43 and 117 basis points, respectively ANALYSIS OF RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following tables show major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, their respective interest income, expenses, yields and costs, and their impact on net interest income due to changes in volume and rates for the quarters and six-month periods ended June 30, 2017 and 2016: TABLE 1 -

The Company constantly monitors the composition and re-pricing of its assets and liabilities to maintain its net interest income at adequate levels. Comparison for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016 Table 1 above shows the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, their respective interest income, expenses, yields and costs, and their impact on net interest income due to changes in volume and rates for the quarters ended June 30, 2017 and 2016. Net interest income of $75.6 million increased 3.1%, or $2.3 million, from $73.3 million, reflecting a decrease in interest expenses of 28.9%, or $4.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in interest income of 2.2%, or $2.0 million.

OFG,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS INTRODUCTION The following discussion of the Company's financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the ""Selected Financial Data"" and the Company's consolidated financial statements and related notes. This discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements. Please see ""Forward-Looking Statements"" and the risk factors set forth in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 (the ""2016 Form 10-K""), for discussion of the uncertainties, risks and assumptions associated with these statements. The Company is a publicly-owned financial holding company that provides a full range of banking and financial services through its subsidiaries, including commercial, consumer, auto and mortgage lending; checking and savings accounts; financial planning, insurance and securities brokerage services; and corporate and individual trust and retirement services. The Company operates through three major business segments: Banking, Wealth Management, and Treasury, and distinguishes itself based on quality service. The Company has 48 branches in Puerto Rico and a subsidiary in Boca Raton, Florida. The Company's long-term goal is to strengthen its banking and financial services franchise by expanding its lending businesses, increasing the level of integration in the marketing and delivery of banking and financial services, maintaining effective asset-liability management, growing non-interest revenue from banking and financial services, and improving operating efficiencies. The Company's diversified mix of businesses and products generates both the interest income traditionally associated with a banking institution and non-interest income traditionally associated with a financial services institution (generated by such businesses as securities brokerage, fiduciary services, investment banking, insurance agency, and retirement plan administration). Although all of these businesses, to varying degrees, are affected by interest rate and financial market fluctuations and other external factors, the Company's commitment is to continue producing a balanced and growing revenue stream. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires management to make a number of judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets, liabilities, income and expenses in the consolidated financial statements. Understanding our accounting policies and the extent to which we use management judgment and estimates in applying these policies is integral to understanding our financial statements. We provide a summary of our significant accounting policies in ""Note 1-Summary of Significant Accounting Policies"" of our 2016 Form 10-K. In the ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates"" section of our 2016 Form 10-K, we identified the following accounting policies as critical because they require significant judgments and assumptions about highly complex and inherently uncertain matters and the use of reasonably different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on our reported results of operations or financial condition: Loans and lease receivables We evaluate our critical accounting estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis and update them as necessary based on changing conditions.

The Company reported $11.7 million, or $0.26 per share fully diluted, compared to $12.1 million, or $0.27 per share, in the fourth quarter of 2016 and $10.7 million, or $0.24 per share, in the year ago quarter. Retail franchise continues to grow. The Company's auto and consumer loan generation was strong, customer deposits increased 1.3% from December 31, 2016, and retail accounts grew 5% year over year. Innovation streak continues. The Company introduced the first fully integrated online and mobile personal loan application in Puerto Rico. Net interest margin expanded. NIM increased 16 basis points from the fourth quarter of 2016 to 5.10% due to a significant reduction in the cost of borrowings and as the proportion of higher yielding auto and consumer loans increased. The FDIC shared-loss agreements were terminated. The termination was in line with the Company's ongoing efforts to optimize its operations. Credit quality strong. The net charge off, non-performing loan and total delinquency rates declined from the fourth quarter of 2016. Major performance ratios solid. Return on average assets was 0.95%, return on average tangible common stockholders' equity 7.00%, and efficiency ratio 56.15%. Capital buildup continues. All major capital metrics advanced compared to the previous and year ago quarters. Tangible book value per common share at $15.33 was up 1.7% and 4.4%, respectively, and the tangible common equity ratio at 10.66% was up 33 and 116 basis points, respectively.

The Company constantly monitors the composition and re-pricing of its assets and liabilities to maintain its net interest income at adequate levels. Comparison for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 Table 1 above shows the major categories of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities, their respective interest income, expenses, yields and costs, and their impact on net interest income due to changes in volume and rates for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and 2016. Net interest income of $74.6 million slightly decreased 0.5% compared with $75.0 million, reflecting a decrease in interest income of 5.6%, partially offset by a decrease in interest expenses of 29.2%. The decrease in interest income was caused by decreases in interest income from investments of 16.0% and interest income from loans of 4.3%. Interest expenses decreased primarily as a result of decreases in interest expenses from securities sold under agreements to repurchase of 46.8% and interest expenses from other borrowings of 54.0%. Interest rate spread increased 43 basis points from 4.59% to 5.02%. This increase is mainly due to the net effect of a 20 basis point increase in the average yield of interest-earning assets from 5.69% to 5.89% and to 23 basis point decrease in average costs of interest-bearing liabilities from 1.10% to 0.87%. Interest income decreased to $86.2 million from $91.3 million. Such decrease reflects a decrease of $8.0 million in the volume of interest-earning assets partially offset by an increase of $2.9 million in the interest rate of interest-earning assets. Interest income from loans decreased 4.32% to $77.7 million, reflecting a decrease of $7.1 million in the volume, partially offset by an increase of $3.6 million in the interest rate, primarily due to lower loan balances, but higher yields. Interest income from investments decreased 16.0% to $8.5 million, reflecting a decrease in volume and interest rate of $840 thousand and $786 thousand, respectively. Originated loans interest income increased 8.4% to $52.0 million, as average balances dropped 2.7% and yields increased to 6.99%, mainly from higher yields in commercial, mortgage and retail categories. Acquired BBVAPR loans interest income declined 25.6% to $19.1 million as average balances declined 19.6% and yields decreased 54 basis points to 7.76%. Acquired Eurobank loans interest income fell 12.8% to $6.6 million as average balances declined 10.7% and yields decreased 24 basis points to 20.86%. The average balance of total interest-earning assets was $5.933 billion, a decrease of 7.8% from the same period in 2016. The decrease in average balance of interest-earning assets was mainly attributable to decreases of 8.3% and 7.6% in the average balances of investments and loans, respectively. The decreases in investments and loans reflect the sale of $277.2 million in mortgage-backed securities during the first quarter of 2016 and the sale of the $200.0 million participation in the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (""PREPA"") line of credit on October 7, 2016, respectively. Interest expense decreased 29.2% to $11.6 million, primarily because of a $3.9 million decrease in the volume and a $859 thousand decrease in interest rate of interest-bearing liabilities, mostly due to the decrease in repurchase agreements volume and rate of $1.7 million and of $1.1 million, respectively, and the decrease in other borrowings volume and rate of $2.1 million and $34 thousand, respectively. The decrease in borrowings balances resulted from the repayment at maturity of $227.0 million of short term FHLB advances during the second quarter of 2016, and also to the repayment at maturity of $232 million of repurchase agreements during the first quarter of 2017. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities was partially offset by an increase in deposit interest rate of $315 thousand and a decrease in volume of $86 thousand. Total cost of borrowings decreased 60 basis points to 2.38% from 2.98%. The cost of deposits slightly increased 4 basis point to 0.64%, when compared to 0.60% for the same period in 2016. Comparison of quarters ended March 31, 2016 and 2015 Net interest income of $75.0 million decreased 16.4% compared with $89.6 million reported in the first quarter of 2015, reflecting a decrease of 16.8% in interest income from loans. Interest rate spread decreased 76 basis points from 5.35% to 4.59%. This decrease is mainly due to the net effect of a 78 basis points decrease in the average yield of interest-earning assets from 6.47% to 5.69%. Interest income decreased to $91.3 million from $107.0 million in the first quarter of 2016. Such decrease reflects decreases of $12.2 million and $3.5 million in the volume and interest rate, respectively, of interest-earning assets. Interest income from loans decreased 16.8% to $81.2 million, reflecting a decrease in volume and interest rate by $12.5 million and a $3.9 million, respectively, primarily due to lower acquired loan balances and yields. Our loan portfolio is transitioning as originated loans with normal yields grow at a slower pace than higher-yielding acquired loans fall due to repayments and maturities. Originated loans interest income increased 3.5% to $47.9 million as average balances grew 9.4% and yields decreased 43 basis points to 6.20%. During the first quarter of 2015, the revolving line of credit to PREPA was classified as non-accrual. Starting with the second quarter of 2015, quarterly interest payments of $3.6 million per quarter, have been applied to principal, reducing the yield on originated loans. In addition, as a result of the Company's efforts to reduce our risk in Puerto Rico government exposures, the outstanding balance of credit facilities to public corporations decreased as a result of a repayment in full of a $75 million loan by the Puerto Rico Aqueduct and Sewer Authority in the second quarter of 2015 and a repayment in full of a $78 million loan by the State Insurance Fund Corporation in the third quarter of 2015. Acquired BBVAPR loans interest income declined 28.1% to $25.7 million as average balances declined 26.5% and yields decreased 28 basis points to 8.30%. Acquired Eurobank loans interest income fell 51.2% to $7.6 million as average balances declined 47.6% and yields decreased 183 basis points to 21.06%. Interest income from investments increased 6.7% to $10.2 million, reflecting increases in volume and interest rate of $219 thousand and $417 thousand, respectively. The average balance of total interest-earning assets was $6.437 billion, a decrease of 4.0% from the same period in 2015. The decrease in average balance of interest-earning assets was mainly attributable to a decrease of 6.5% in average loans, partially offset by an increase of 2.3% in average investments. The decrease in average loans is mostly related to the bulk sale on September 28, 2015, of a portion of covered non-performing commercial loans amounting to $197.1 million unpaid principal balance or UPB ($100.0 million carrying amount). The FDIC agreed to cover $20.0 million of losses as part of its loss-share agreement with the Company. Also, as part of this transaction, the Company sold certain non-performing commercial loans and real estate owned from the BBVAPR acquisition amounting to $38.1 million of unpaid principal balance ($9.9 million carrying amount). Interest expense decreased 6.0% to $16.3 million, primarily because of a $1.3 million decrease in the volume of interest-bearing liabilities and an increase of $292 thousand in interest rate. The decrease in interest-bearing liabilities is mostly due to the decrease in repurchase agreements volume of $1.1 million and a decrease in deposit volume of $269 thousand which was offset by an increase in interest rate of $289 thousand. The decrease in repurchase agreement volume reflects a partial unwinding of repurchase agreements amounting to $268.0 million, which carried a cost of 4.78%. The cost of deposits before fair value amortization and core deposit intangible amortization slightly increased 1 basis point to 0.71% for the first quarter of 2016, compared to 0.70% for the first quarter of 2015. The cost of borrowings decreased 4 basis points to 2.98% from 3.02%. TABLE 2 - NON-INTEREST INCOME SUMMARY . . .  May 05, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

OFG,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Jan 30, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OFG Bancorp OFG, +1.44% today reported results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. 4Q17 results reflected a strong recovery following hurricanes Irma and Maria, which struck the island in September 2017. 4Q17 Summary Net income available to shareholders increased to $13.6 million, or $0.30 per share fully diluted, from a net loss of $146 thousand, or $0.00 per share, in 3Q17. OFG reported net income of $12.1 million, or $0.27 per share fully diluted, in 4Q16. Return on average assets and average tangible common equity was 1.10% and 7.92%, respectively. Tangible book value per common share was $15.67, and the tangible common equity ratio was 11.29%. 4Q17 results included $5.4 million in loan loss provision, pre-tax, based on new data available on the potential impact of the hurricanes. Excluding that additional provision, 4Q17 adjusted net income available to shareholders totaled $16.9 million, or $0.37 per share fully diluted. 2017 Summary Net income available to shareholders was $38.8 million, or $0.86 per share fully diluted, compared to $45.3 million, or $1.03 per share, in 2016. 2017 results included a $32.4 million loan loss provision, pre-tax, related to the hurricanes. Excluding that special provision, full year adjusted net income available to shareholders totaled $61.0 million, or $1.34 per share fully diluted. CEO Comment José Rafael Fernàndez, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman of the Board, commented: “OFG’s fourth quarter results were strong considering the impact of the hurricanes, the slow restoration of electricity, and the resultant uncertainties. EPS before an additional $5.4 million provision for potential hurricane losses was $0.37. “We are encouraged with how our commercial clients and retail customers have responded. Total net loans increased more than $90 million from 3Q17. December-ended loan payment moratoriums are showing encouraging trends in all portfolios. “New loan generation increased more than 32% from 3Q17, rivaling our best quarter of the year. All our one-on-one outreach with commercial clients following the hurricanes is building a strong pipeline for new loan business. “Auto loan production had one of its best quarters. During December, consumer lending returned to approximately 70% of pre-hurricanes production. Mortgage loans demand, however, was understandably down as residential sales slowed. “At December 31, customer deposits were up $267 million from June 30. Non-interest bearing deposits reached close to $1 billion. During December, average monthly net new customer acquisition returned to pre-hurricanes levels, and bank service revenues began to recover with more retail point of sale terminals back on line. Thus far, we haven’t seen any signs that outmigration is affecting our customer base. “4Q17 results are a testament to our successful effort in restoring operations quickly after the hurricanes. Our clientele and the communities we serve clearly appreciated our efforts as we are starting to see momentum build despite a very challenging environment. “Puerto Rico is not out of the woods yet, and the island has a long reconstruction road ahead. However, with the expected benefit from an influx of substantial funds from the federal government as well as from insurance recoveries over the next two years, the short-term outlook is hopeful.” Income Statement Highlights Unless otherwise noted, the following compares data for the fourth quarter 2017 to the third quarter 2017. Interest Income Originated Loans: $56.2 million compared to $58.9 million. 3Q17 included $4.1 million from the pay-off before maturity of a commercial loan previously classified as non-accrual. Excluding that item, 4Q17 interest income from Originated Loans increased $1.3 million due to higher balances. Acquired Loans: $18.9 million compared to $23.5 million. 3Q17 included $3.1 million in cost recoveries from the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (PRHFA) canceling a loan. Excluding that item, 4Q17 interest income from Acquired Loans declined $1.5 million, reflecting continued pay downs. Interest Expense declined $0.2 million to $9.7 million due to reduced borrowings. Total Provision for Loan and Lease Losses declined $19.1 million to $24.9 million. Provision, excluding additional hurricanes related provisions of $5.4 million and $27.0 million in 4Q17 and 3Q17, respectively, was $19.5 million compared to $17.0 million due to the increase in the Originated Loans portfolio. Net Interest Margin was 5.08% compared to 5.64%. 3Q17 benefitted from the previously mentioned pay-off of an originated commercial loan as well as cost recoveries. Compared to the year ago quarter, 4Q17 NIM increased 14 basis points. Total Banking and Wealth Management Revenues declined $0.5 million to $16.7 million. Banking service revenues declined $1.5 million. This reflected lower banking fee income from reduced activity related to business interruptions due to lack of electricity. 3Q17 benefitted from $0.4 million in prepayment penalties from the previously mentioned loan pay-off before maturity. Wealth Management revenues increased $1.0 million, primarily due to recognition of annual insurance fees. Mortgage banking revenues remained approximately level at $1.2 million. Total Non-Interest Expenses declined $3.8 million to $46.7 million, reflecting: (1) settlement of outstanding claims at amounts below those previously reserved ($1.4 million); (2) lower expenses on foreclosed real estate ($1.3 million); and (3) lower electronic banking expenses due to reduced activity ($1.0 million). Effective Tax Rate (ETR) was 8.99% due to final year-end tax accounting. For the year, the ETR was 23.73% due to (1) higher proportion than anticipated of exempt income and income subject to preferential rates; and (2) expiration of a $0.7 million tax contingency. Balance Sheet Highlights Unless otherwise noted, the following compares data at December 31, 2017 to September 30, 2017. Total Loans Net increased $91.8 million to $4.06 billion with the rebound in production, partially offset by normal pay downs of Acquired Loans. New loan generation increased 32.9% to $253.7 million: Commercial lending increased 121.1% to $102.1 million as our bankers developed relationships with businesses participating in Puerto Rico’s recovery. The quarter also benefited from finalizing loans unable to close in 3Q17 due to the hurricanes. The new OFG USA program added $25.1 million in commercial and industrial related loan participations. The entity began operations in October 2017 with a capital contribution of $50.0 million. Auto lending increased 11.8% to $87.6 million, its best quarter in 2017, reflecting demand to replace damaged vehicles, pent up demand, and attractive retail pricing on new and used cars. While consumer lending declined 31.7% to $23.1 million, there was an increasing trend in the monthly production. Mortgage lending declined 51.2% to $15.9 million as housing sales had yet to recover. Total Investments increased $8.1 million to $1.17 billion, reflecting purchases of new mortgage backed securities to replace pay downs of existing ones. Cash and cash equivalents declined $235.5 million to $488.2 million, mainly due to the unwinding of an $80.0 million repurchase agreement and the increase in interest earning assets. Customer Deposits (excluding brokered deposits) were approximately level at $4.28 billion as deposit growth offset almost all of the temporary influx of insurance company deposits at the end of 3Q17. Average non-interest bearing deposits increased $102.1 million, to $937.3 million. Total Borrowings declined $90.5 million to $328.7 million, primarily due to the unwinding of an $80.0 million repurchase agreement. Due to deposit growth, higher cost borrowings have been reduced by 58.7% or $466.6 million year over year. Total Stockholders’ Equity increased $7.5 million to $945.1 million, reflecting the increase in retained earnings. Credit Quality Highlights Unless otherwise noted, the following compares data on the originated loan portfolio at December 31, 2017 to September 30, 2017. After Irma, Oriental was the only bank to offer fee waivers for late payments, recognizing the difficulties people faced in Puerto Rico. Following Maria, the bank continued to offer automatic payment deferrals and 90-day extensions for most loan categories. Net Charge-Off Rate declined 19 basis points to 1.35% due to lower charge-offs in the consumer loan portfolio as a result of the loan payment moratorium. Early Delinquency Rate declined 197 basis points to 1.82% and Total Delinquency Rate declined 223 basis points to 4.61% due to the automatic moratorium on most retail loans and some commercial loans. Non-Performing Loan Rate increased 21 basis points to 3.31%. This primarily reflected commercial loans current in their monthly payments being placed in non-accrual due to deterioration of their financial statements. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for the originated portfolio increased $5.2 million to $92.7 million, primarily due to higher loan balances. Capital Position Unless otherwise noted, the following compares data at December 31, 2017 to September 30, 2017. Capital continued to grow and remains significantly above regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized institution.

OFG,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Oct 25, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OFG Bancorp OFG, +1.44% today reported results for the third quarter ended September 30, 2017. Results were significantly impacted by Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which struck the island on September 7 and 20, 2017, respectively. 3Q17 Summary Net loss to shareholders was $146 thousand or $0.00 per share. This compares to a profit of $13.6 million, or $0.30 per share fully diluted, in 2Q17 and a profit of $11.7 million, or $0.26 per share fully diluted, in the year ago 3Q16. Tangible book value per common share was $15.49 and tangible common equity ratio was 10.98%, with common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 14.89%, Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 19.53%, and total risk-based capital ratio of 20.82%. Based on current assessments of information available for the impact of the hurricanes on our credit portfolio, 3Q17 results included an additional $27.0 million in loan loss provision, pre-tax. Excluding this provision: Adjusted net income available to shareholders totaled $18.8 million or $0.40 per share fully diluted – an increase of $0.10 per share or 33.0% from 2Q17 and of $0.14 or 53.8% from the year ago 3Q16. Adjusted return on average assets was 1.47% and return on average tangible common equity was 10.90% – 38 and 289 basis points higher than 2Q17, respectively. CEO Comment José Rafael Fernàndez, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman of the Board, commented: “Hurricanes Irma and Maria devastated Puerto Rico and exposed the fragility of our infrastructure and economy. Our deepest sympathy and concern goes out to everyone who has suffered. That includes our own staff and customers. We admire the resilience of all island residents in the face of extremely challenging recovery efforts. “After the hurricanes, our efforts were focused on assuring the safety and well-being of all members of our team and securing our assets. Our operations continue to be constrained by several factors, in particular challenges with electricity and telecommunications. However, we are committed to doing everything we can to help our customers rebuild their personal lives and businesses. As we say, juntos lograremos màs – together we will achieve more! “Due to our investments in technology, OFG’s digital channels, core banking and electronic funds transfer systems continued to function uninterrupted during and after the hurricanes. Within days after Maria, and after securing a continuing supply of diesel fuel for generators, we started opening branches and ATMs with no limits on teller withdrawals. As a result, we were able to serve our clients regardless of which branches they chose. “Today, we have 20 branches and 142 ATMs open, in addition to our digital and phone channels. Current branch activity is primarily deposit transactions. While demand for lending and other business is still tame, commercial and auto loan production has begun to pick up a little. “We are very proud of the truly exceptional efforts of our entire team for going the extra mile to help our customers under very difficult circumstances. After Irma, Oriental was the only bank to offer fee waivers for late payments, recognizing the difficulties people in Puerto Rico might have. Following Maria, we continued to assist our customers by offering automatic payment deferrals and 90-day extensions for most loan categories. “There is no doubt the economy will be extremely challenging in the short term. But it is widely expected several industry sectors will benefit from the anticipated massive rebuilding effort. Although the magnitude and timing of such benefit is not yet clear, Puerto Rico and OFG need to look forward to a ‘new normal’ and take advantage of the potential opportunities it will present. “With our strong capital position, OFG is well prepared. We have repeatedly demonstrated our ability to grow during difficult times. We look forward to doing so again.” 3Q17 Income Statement Highlights The following compares data for the third quarter 2017 to the second quarter 2017, unless otherwise noted. Interest Income from Originated Loans, increased $5.5 million to $58.9 million, reflecting $4.1 million from the pay-off before maturity of a commercial loan previously classified as non-accrual. Acquired Loans, declined $0.3 million to $23.5 million, reflecting continued pay downs offset by cost recoveries. In 3Q17, the Company recognized $3.1 million in cost recoveries when the Puerto Rico Housing Finance Authority (PRHFA) paid to cancel a loan that had a $10.6 million book balance. Securities, declined $0.8 million to $7.9 million from lower balances partially offset by higher yields on higher cash balances. Interest Expense declined $0.5 million to $9.9 million primarily due to lower borrowings. Total Provision for Loan and Lease Losses increased $17.5 million to $44.0 million. 3Q17 reflects regular provision of $17.0 million and the previously mentioned additional hurricane related provision of $27.0 million. Of that $27.0 million, $16.8 million was applied to originated loans and $10.2 million to acquired loans. Net Interest Margin expanded to 5.64% from 5.18%. This was due to the above mentioned pay-off of an originated commercial loan classified as non-accrual. It also reflected cost recoveries, lower borrowing balances and costs, and higher cash balances and yield. Total Banking and Wealth Management Revenues declined $0.7 million to $17.2 million. During 3Q17, the Company experienced lower banking and wealth management activity levels in September. This was partially offset by increased mortgage banking revenues from servicing asset valuation and prepayment penalty income from the above mentioned commercial loan. Other Non-Interest Income totaled $0.7 million compared to $7.0 million. In 2Q17, the Company had a net gain of $6.8 million on the sale of MBS. Total Non-Interest Expenses declined $2.3 million to $50.5 million. 2Q17 included costs associated with consolidating office space and lower credit related expenses. Income Tax decreased $3.4 million to $560 thousand. 3Q17 reflected lower net income before taxes at the 2017 estimated tax rate of 29.77%. In addition, 3Q17 benefitted from the $0.9 million resolution of a contingent tax position. 2Q17 included a $2.1 million beneficial catch-up adjustment to estimated income tax. September 30, 2017 Balance Sheet Highlights The following compares data at September 30, 2017 to June 30, 2017, unless otherwise noted. Total Loans Net declined $127.3 million to $3.96 billion. The decline reflecting the previously announced sale of a $38.0 million municipal loan, continued pay downs of acquired loans, and the $27.0 million additional hurricane loan loss provision.  New loan generation fell to $190.8 million due to declines in commercial, mortgage and consumer lending in September. Auto loan production was level with 2Q17 due to strong performance in the first two months of 3Q17. Total Investments declined $63.7 million to $1.16 billion, primarily due to the sale of $45.0 million in Treasury securities. Total Borrowings declined $208.0 million to $419.3 million, primarily due to the maturities of $160.4 million in short-term repurchase agreement funding and $72.9 million in Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Cash and cash equivalents increased $243.4 million to $723.8 million, due to increased deposits and lower transaction outflows toward the end of the quarter from commercial customers. Customer Deposits increased $243.7 million to $4.83 billion, reflecting deposits from commercial customers mentioned above. Total Stockholders’ Equity declined $1.3 million to $937.6 million, primarily due to decrease in retained earnings. Credit Quality Highlights The following compares data on the originated loan portfolio at September 30, 2017 to June 30, 2017, unless otherwise noted. Net Charge-Off Rate declined 25 basis points to 1.54%. 2Q17 reflected an increase for commercial loans with the sale of the municipality loan. Early Delinquency Rate increased 27 basis points to 3.79% and Total Delinquency Rate increased 53 basis points to 6.84% due to increases in September. Non-Performing Loans declined 6 basis points to 3.10%, due to improvements in the mortgage, commercial and consumer loan categories, partially offset by an increase in the auto loan category. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses for the originated portfolio increased $17.9 million to $87.5 million. This was mainly due to the previously mentioned additional provision of $16.8 million related to the hurricanes. Capital Position The following compares data at September 30, 2017 to June 30, 2017, unless otherwise noted. Capital continued to build and remains significantly above regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized institution. Tangible Common Equity Ratio at 10.98% decreased 11 basis points from 2Q17 but increased 73 basis points year over year. Tangible Book Value per Common Share at $15.49 decreased $0.02 cents from 2Q17, but increased $0.31 or 2.1% year over year. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio (using Basel III methodology) at 14.89% increased 23 basis points from 2Q17 and 155 basis points year over year to the highest level in five quarters. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio at 20.82% increased 40 basis points from 2Q17 and 209 basis points year over year to the highest level in five quarters.

OFG,"SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico, Jul 21, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- OFG Bancorp OFG today reported results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. 2Q17 Highlights Net income available to shareholders increased. OFG reported $13.6 million, or $0.30 per share fully diluted, compared to $11.7 million, or $0.26 per share fully diluted, in 1Q17 and $10.9 million, or $0.25 per share fully diluted, in the year ago 2Q16. Puerto Rico municipality exposure reduced. OFG opportunistically sold a $38.0 million performing term loan with a municipality, resulting in a $4.3 million pre-tax loss. The sale reduced OFG’s exposure to this sector by approximately 27% from March 31, 2017, to $140.8 million after July payments. Balance sheet de-levered further. OFG unwound a 1.48% $100.0 million repurchase agreement, in line with its strategy to reduce borrowings. Related to this, OFG sold $166.0 million of mortgage backed securities (MBS). These transactions resulted in a tax-advantaged gain of $6.9 million. Effective tax rate optimized. OFG now forecasts its 2017 effective tax rate (ETR) to be 29.15% as compared to its previously stated 38% estimate. The new rate is similar to its 2016 rate and resulted in a $2.1 million beneficial adjustment to estimated income tax in 2Q17. Net interest margin (NIM) improved. Due to a significant reduction in the cost of borrowings and higher yields on variable rate commercial loans and on cash, NIM increased 8 basis points from 1Q17 to 5.18%. Credit quality and major performance ratios remained solid. The non-performing loan and total delinquency rates fell to the lowest levels in the last five quarters. Return on average assets was 1.09%, return on average tangible common stockholders’ equity was 8.01%, and the efficiency ratio was 56.49%. Capital buildup continued. All major capital metrics advanced compared to the preceding and year ago quarters. Tangible book value per common share at $15.51 was up 1.2% and 3.7%, respectively, while tangible common equity ratio at 11.09% was up 43 and 117 basis points, respectively. CEO Comment José Rafael Fernàndez, President, Chief Executive Officer, and Vice Chairman of the Board, commented: “OFG’s 2Q17 results of $0.30 per share underscored the stability in our business. We have pro-actively managed the environment, exploiting available financial and operating levers, as evident from the resiliency in our results. “More importantly, our retail franchise continued to grow, with increases in loan generation and customer base. We were the first in the market to emphasize superior customer experience through innovation, which seems to be in everyone else’s vocabulary now. “As part of our continuing leadership in bringing innovative customer facing solutions to Puerto Rico, Oriental released a new and re-designed version of our mobile banking app. We also finished deploying deposit taking capabilities in all 47 on premise ATMs. We are highly encouraged with customer adoption levels and feedback. “We continue to be committed to delivering stable financial results in line with the range discussed at the beginning of the year.” 2Q17 Income Statement Highlights The following compares data for the second quarter 2017 to the first quarter 2017, unless otherwise noted. Interest Income from Originated Loans, increased $1.5 million to $53.5 million due to higher yields from variable rate commercial loans. from Acquired Loans, declined $1.9 million to $23.8 million reflecting continued pay downs and lower cost recoveries. from Securities, increased $0.2 million to $8.7 million from higher yields on cash balances. Interest Expense declined $1.2 million to $10.4 million, primarily due to a full quarter impact of the March 2017 repayment of a 4.78% $232.0 million repurchase agreement. Total Provision for Loan and Lease Losses increased $8.9 million to $26.5 million. This included the previously mentioned loss of $4.3 million on the sale of a municipality loan, an additional provision of $5.9 million for remaining loans to four other municipalities, and $2.3 million in recoveries on auto and consumer loans. Core Net Interest Margin (excluding cost recoveries) expanded to 5.12% from 5.01% primarily due to lower borrowing balances and costs. Total Banking and Wealth Management Revenues increased $0.5 million to $17.9 million, with increases in wealth management fees and in mortgage banking from servicing asset valuation and higher loan production. Other Non-Interest Income reflected the previously mentioned $6.9 million gain on the sale of securities. In 1Q17, there was a $1.4 million gain related to the final outcome of terminating the FDIC shared-loss agreement. Total Non-Interest Expenses increased $1.1 million to $52.8 million. This was primarily due to costs associated with consolidating office space, partially offset by lower credit expenses. Income Tax declined $5.2 million to $4.0 million. The reduction reflects the new 2017 estimated tax rate as a result of a higher proportion of exempt income, including the gain on sale of MBS. June 30, 2017 Balance Sheet Highlights The following compares data at June 30, 2017 to March 31, 2017, unless otherwise noted. Total Loans Net increased $2.2 million to $4.09 billion. New retail generation rose to $174.1 million, with growth in consumer and mortgage loans, partially offset by a decline in auto. Commercial loan generation expanded to $80.4 million with the closing of new small business and middle market loans. Total Investments declined $173.9 million to $1.22 billion due to the previously mentioned MBS sale as well as prepayments. Customer Deposits declined $128.1 million to $4.01 billion, largely the result of a decision not to retain a high cost corporate and a government client. Total Borrowings declined $45.1 million to $627.3 million due to the previously mentioned unwinding of a repurchase agreement in 2Q17. Total Stockholders’ Equity increased $7.5 million to $939.0 million primarily due to increases in retained earnings. Credit Quality Highlights The following compares data at June 30, 2017 to March 31, 2017, unless otherwise noted. Net Charge-Off Rate increased 39 basis points to 1.79%. This reflected an increase for commercial loans with the sale of the municipality loan, partially offset by reductions in all retail loan categories. The auto and consumer loan net charge-off rate benefited from previously mentioned recoveries. Early Delinquency Rate increased 10 basis points to 3.52% due to increases in auto and mortgage lending, partially offset by improvements in consumer and commercial lending. Total Delinquency Rate declined 3 basis points to 6.31%, reflecting improvements in mortgage and consumer lending, partially offset by increases in auto and commercial lending. Non-Performing Loans remained relatively stable at 3.16% with declines in the mortgage and auto lending non-performing loan rates offset by increases in the commercial and consumer lending non-performing loan rates. Allowance for Loan and Lease Losses increased $9.2 million to $69.7 million due to originated loan growth and the previously mentioned allowance for loans to municipalities. Capital Position The following compares data at June 30, 2017 to March 31, 2017, unless otherwise noted. Capital continued to build and remains significantly above regulatory requirements for a well-capitalized institution. Tangible Common Equity to Total Tangible Assets at 11.09% increased 43 basis points from 1Q17 and 117 basis points year over year, to the highest level in five quarters. Tangible Book Value per Common Share at $15.51 increased 1.2% from 1Q17 and 3.7% year over year to the highest level in five quarters. Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio (using Basel III methodology) at 14.66% increased 36 basis points from 1Q17 and 202 basis points year over year to the highest level in five quarters. Total Risk-Based Capital Ratio at 20.42% increased 37 basis points from 1Q17 and 242 basis points year over year to the highest level in five quarters.
