AAU,"MEXICO CITY, Mar 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The company seeks to render invisible affected indigenous communities. Five days ago, Vancouver B.C.-based Almaden Minerals Ltd. published a press release (""Almaden Updates Feasibility Study at Ixtaca"") in which the company omits material information about the Ixtaca Project located in Puebla, Mexico. 1. Water consumption: Almaden Minerals states it will collect and store enough rainwater to supply the nearby population and mine; however, according to a community-led impact assessment elaborated together with civil society organizations, rainwater will be insufficient for the mine's operations considering the low-to-medium rainfall in the municipality of only 500-600 mm annually, according to the Ixtacamaxtitl�n Meteorological Station. Mining requires a gigantic volume of water. One example is the Caballo Blanco mine in Veracruz, which produced 30,000 tons of material (a rate equal to that projected for the Ixtaca Project) and annually consumed 3,000 cubic meters of water. This means that the approximate annual use for Ixtacamaxtitl�n would be 1,195,000 cubic meters, only for the mining activity zone. 2. Social investment plan (SIP): Almaden states that its subcontractor, GMI Consultants, will hold meetings with local communities to inform them of its SIP, but fails to mention that the Ixtaca Project has already been rejected by the communities and ejidos of the region, which, since 2014, have denounced existing violations of environmental regulations and human rights violations committed by Almaden during the exploration stage. Communities have taken regulatory and legal action so that local and federal authorities not grant the necessary permits for the extraction phase of the mine, including the environmental impact assessment. 3. Indigenous population: Additionally, GMI Consultants has sought to render invisible the indigenous population of the area, stating that it ""did not identify indigenous communities or people that speak native languages within the area of influence of the project."" This contradicts official information and that presented by Almaden to Mexico's environmental regulator, SEMARNAT, in February 2017, where it mentions that ""11.82% of the population of the inhabitants of the municipality speak an indigenous language, mainly Nahuatl.""

AAU,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Mar 21, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Almaden Minerals Ltd. (""Almaden"" or ""the Company"") (nyse american:AAU) (AMM) is pleased to update investors on the environmental and engineering work relating to the feasibility study (FS) at the Ixtaca gold-silver project located in Puebla State, Mexico. The Company has selected a team of independent engineers including SRK Consulting (U.S.), Inc. (SRK) and Moose Mountain Technical Services (""MMTS"") to lead the FS. Various programs currently underway include: A resource model update to include new drill hole data; Metallurgical test work to: demonstrate repeatability of metallurgical performance; test opportunities to further improve metallurgical performance; Process and Infrastructure FS engineering design; Mine planning and production optimization studies; Further disassembly of the Rock Creek processing plant to accelerate preparations for moving the plant to the Ixtaca site; Construction and commissioning project management planning; Geotechnical site investigation work; and Water management studies. Almaden is also in the final stage of preparing an Environmental Impact Assessment (Manifiesto de Impacto Ambiental or ""MIA"") for Ixtaca and expects to submit the MIA this year. Morgan Poliquin, President and CEO of Almaden, stated ""We are pleased to have selected SRK and MMTS to conduct the Ixtaca gold-silver project Feasibility Study. Along with greater detail on the feasibility of the project, we are developing a full understanding of social, hydrologic, hydrogeologic and geochemical conditions at the site well in advance of mining activity. This is all based on the work of the independent engineers we have engaged, utilising best practices to international standards and is peer reviewed. This understanding will help us ensure that the potential impacts associated with eventual project development are identified and mitigated and the opportunities for all stakeholders are capitalised upon through the project life and beyond. Over the last year exploration drilling has been delivering encouraging results, both in the mine plan area and beyond, which supports our belief that sustained exploration can extend the mine life."" Hydrology and Geochemistry Almaden is working closely with authorities and local communities to protect local water resources while improving quality and availability. The current mine plan includes a water storage reservoir to be co-operated and maintained by local residents during and after mine operation to provide a consistent and long-term supply of water to local residents. Rainfall in the Ixtaca vicinity falls primarily during a relatively short rainy season. With no local water storage facilities the flash flows of water are lost to the community. Under the FS development plan, rainwater will be captured during the rainy season in the water storage reservoir and slowly released during the dry season, for use by both the mining operation and local residents. Almaden is also exploring additional solutions to improve the quality of drinking water available to residents in the context of a Social Investment Plan (see press release of December 12, 2017). Water quality and a consistent long-term supply for local residents is one of Almaden's top priorities at Ixtaca and a major component of the feasibility study. In support of this priority for the FS, Almaden and SRK will expand upon the recent (2017) pre-feasibility study (PFS) [1] through the completion of additional soil, surface water and ground water characterization that will facilitate a more detailed facility design. The PFS and subsequent studies include the following highlights relating to water: Local water resources are underutilized and the mine plan will not disturb local domestic water sources. In the current plan, groundwater pumping wells will not be required, according to baseline hydrology studies and water balance models. A robust tailings management facility (TMF) has been designed so that no process water is discharged, i.e. the TMF will be a ""zero discharge facility"". Mine development includes a water storage reservoir that, based on current water balance planning, could supply more than 2,000 m [3] per day to the local community. The neutralizing potential present in the site rocks is sufficient to neutralize any acid generated. Two geochemical studies completed in 2015 and 2017 evaluated the potential for acid rock drainage and metal leaching from the waste rock and tailings using globally-accepted standardized methods of laboratory testing and in compliance with Mexican regulations; including NOM-157-SEMARNAT-2009, which establishes procedures to implement mine waste management plans and Anexo Normative 5 of NOM-141-SEMARNAT-2003, which describes the test methods for whole rock chemistry analysis, leach tests and acid base accounting. The studies stated that ""there is more than enough neutralizing potential present in the site rocks to neutralize any acid generated,"" and also reported that laboratory testing indicates a low potential for metal leaching. To confirm these findings and to bring the geochemical data set to feasibility level, SRK's scope for the geochemical characterization program in the FS will be expanded to include additional geochemical sampling to evaluate the development rock and tailings in greater detail. Community and Transparency A key component of Almaden's work at Ixtaca continues to be engagement with people in the region. With the receipt of the summary Social Impact Assessment late last year, Almaden has commenced the development of a Social Investment Plan (""SIP""). Representatives of GMI Consulting are currently preparing for consultations which will inform the SIP. In recent years, with the continued advancement of engineering studies, Almaden has had the opportunity to expand its program of social engagement in the area of the Ixtaca project, with a special focus on providing opportunities for local stakeholders to learn about the Ixtaca project in particular and the mining industry in general. Videos showing some of the approaches we are using are available on the Almaden website (www.almadenminerals.com). To date, Almaden has: Coordinated eight large community meetings, with total attendance at these meetings of more than 3,300 people. Taken a total of approximately 480 people, drawn from local communities, on 24 trips to see an operating mine (see video on website). Arranged 35 sessions of ""Dialogos Transversales"", wherein community members are invited to attend discussions with experts on a diverse range of issues relating to the mining industry, such as an overview of Mexican Mining Law, Human Rights and Mining, mineral processing, explosives, water in mining, risk management, and mine infrastructure, among other things (see video on website). Opened a central community office in the town of Santa Maria Zotoltepec, which is open to community members and includes an anonymous suggestion box. Developed a ""Mobile Information Module"" which allows company representatives to visit communities and provide information to communities more distant from the project. To date 35 communities have been visited. Employed as many local people as possible, reaching up to 75 people drawn from 5 local communities. Almaden operates the drills used at the project, and hence can draw and train a local workforce as opposed to bringing in external contractors. Initiated a program of scholarships for top performing local students, with 100 scholarships granted to date to individuals from 31 different communities (57 women and 43 men). Established several clubs, including English, reading, zumba, football, and theatre clubs, to contribute to the vitality of local communities. Focused on education, enabling over 4,300 people to be positively impacted by our investments, such as rehabilitation of school-related infrastructure, donation of electronic equipment, and scholarships for top-performing students.

A list of specific projects worked on by MMTS can be found at www.moosemmc.com. About Ixtaca: The proposed Ixtaca mine is anticipated to process 7,500 tonnes per day of primarily limestone host rock with lesser amounts of shale and volcanic tuff to produce gold and silver dore. The Pre-Feasibility Study announced in April, 2017 [1] projects that the mine will employ 400 people during construction, 430 over the mine life, and contribute on the order of US$248 million in taxes, including approximately US$55 million to Puebla State and US$35 million to the local municipality. Since 2014, Almaden has been conducting a detailed water monitoring program in the project area to measure the pre-mining water quality conditions and to establish a baseline against which potential future impacts to surface water and groundwater from mining activity can be evaluated. The program includes eight groundwater monitoring wells and 12 surface water monitoring stations. As part of the FS, groundwater monitoring will be expanded with the installation of additional wells completed under SRK's hydrogeologic study for the open pit. In addition, the existing surface water monitoring program will be augmented to supplement the existing database of streamflow data. A sitewide water balance model was developed in support of the 2017 PFS to develop a water management strategy that focuses on consuming all impacted water generated at the site in the mineral extraction and beneficiation process and avoids having to treat and discharge water to the environment or require additional external sources of water. As part of this strategy, a large portion of the water used by the process plant is recycled water collected from the tailings facility. Additional water required by the process plant is supplied by collection of runoff and rainwater through the construction of a water supply reservoir. The current water management strategy calls for up to 850,000 m [3] of runoff and rainwater to be released annually to the downstream communities during and following mine operations. Based on the results of the water balance model and water management plan, impacts on the groundwater aquifer and surface water sources in the area are not anticipated to be significant, as the proposed project facilities do not impact the current water supply for local communities. In addition, the groundwater aquifer around the mine is not over-exploited according to a 2007 CONAGUA study, and additional studies found that the Water Stress Index in the region is very low (0.029 on a scale of 0.01 to 1.0, with least stressed at 0.01 to most stressed at 1.0). During the FS the water balance model will be updated to include a daily simulation model based on project design changes and additional site monitoring data and a more robust water footprint will be developed for the mine to confirm the current outlook.

AAU,"VANCOUVER, B.C., Feb 28, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Almaden Minerals Ltd. (""Almaden"" or ""the Company"") (AMM) (nyse american:AAU) is pleased to announce new assay results from Almaden's ongoing exploration and development program at the Company's Tuligtic project, Mexico. Today's results are from the Tano Zone which is located about 1.2 kilometres southwest, along strike from the Main Ixtaca Zone and the 2017 Pre-Feasibility Study (""PFS"") pit. The Tano zone covers an area of exposed volcanic and breccia hosted alteration and elevated gold in soil samples. Previous drilling in this area identified veining and mineralisation. Further interpretation of these past results led to the drilling of the holes released today which now confirm significant mineralisation in this part of the property. There is no drilling between the holes announced today and the PFS pit area, along the 060 Azimuth trend of the Main Ixtaca Zone, and this gap is considered highly prospective. Further drilling in the Tano Zone area is currently underway. Highlights of today's results include the following intercepts: Tuligtic Project Plan Map   Tano Zone Plan Map           Hole TU-17-530        Az. 270, Dip -50         46.00 meters @ 0.57 g/t Au and 2.2 g/t Ag         Including 26.00 meters @ 0.71 g/t Au and 2.3 g/t Ag         And 6.00 meters @ 1.06 g/t Au and 2.3 g/t Ag                     Hole TU-17-531        Az. 000, Dip -50         10.00 meters @ 2.11 g/t Au and 1.6 g/t Ag         Including 6.00 meters @ 3.38 g/t Au and 2.0 g/t Ag         And 2.00 meters @ 8.17 g/t Au and 3.8 g/t Ag                     Hole TU-17-533        Az. 185, Dip -55         10.50 meters @ 0.83 g/t Au and 2.4 g/t Ag         Including 3.00m @ 1.26 g/t Au and 1.5 g/t Ag             J.D. Poliquin, chairman of Almaden stated, ""We are very encouraged by these results which are beginning to define a new mineralised zone well outside of the PFS pit and resource area. These results demonstrate the potential for discovery on the project and for the Ixtaca mine plan to grow with continued exploration. Ongoing drilling will continue to seek more such zones even as the engineering work and Feasibility Study progress."" About the Ixtaca Deposit Feasibility Program The Company has selected independent engineers Moose Mountain Technical Services (""MMTS"") to lead the feasibility study. Various feasibility-related programs are currently underway, including: Feasibility-level engineering design; Additional geotechnical evaluations in areas of infrastructure and pit slope; Continued monitoring of water quality and flow; Metallurgical test work to further refine the process flowsheet; The Comisi�n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the state-owned electric utility of Mexico, has confirmed the availability of power from its substation located 27 km from the Ixtaca Project; Assessment of contractors suitable to complete site access road improvements required for the mine construction. MMTS is an association of Geologists, Engineers and Technicians providing experienced knowledge in Geology, Mine Engineering, and Metallurgical Services and Support to the mining industry for over 15 years. Through their network of associates, they provide an integrated team of experts and QP's. Services range from early grassroots exploration and development, block model builds, resource and reserve estimates, advanced planning and studies for mine proposals (including operational support), process design and permitting process guidance and support. MMTS has experience working on coal, gold, silver, copper, molybdenum, and tungsten deposits throughout North and South America and around the world. A list of specific projects worked on by MMTS can be found at www.moosemmc.com. About the Ixtaca Drilling Program and the Ixtaca ZoneThe Ixtaca Zone is a blind discovery made by the Company in 2010 on claims staked by the Company. The deposit is an epithermal gold-silver deposit, mostly hosted by veins in carbonate units and crosscutting dykes (""basement rocks"") with a minor component of disseminated mineralisation hosted in overlying volcanic rocks. The Ixtaca deposit is located in a developed part of Mexico in Puebla State, the location of significant manufacturing investments including Volkswagen and Audi plants. The deposit is accessed by paved road and is roughly 30 kilometres from an industrial park with rail service where significant manufacturers such as Kimberly Clarke have facilities. Any potential mining operation at Ixtaca would be located in an area previously logged or cleared with negligible to no current land usage. The Company has access to the entire project area and works closely with local officials and residents. The Company has employed roughly 70 people in its exploration program who live local to the Ixtaca deposit. For example, local employees have made up virtually all the drilling staff and have been trained on the job to operate the drill rigs being used at the project. The Company has implemented a comprehensive science based and objective community relations and education program for employees and all local stakeholders to transparently explain the exploration and development program underway as well as the potential impacts and benefits of any possible future mining operation at Ixtaca. The Company regards the local inhabitants to be major stakeholders in the Ixtaca deposit's future along with the Company's shareholders. Every effort is being made to create an open and clear dialogue with our stakeholders to ensure that any possible development scenarios that could evolve from the feasibility study work are properly understood and communicated throughout the course of the Company's exploration and development program. To better explain the impacts of a mining operation at Ixtaca the Company has conducted numerous tours for local residents to third party operated mines in Mexico so that interested individuals can form their own opinions of mining based on first-hand experience. The Company invites all interested parties to visit www.almadenminerals.com to find out more about our community development, education and outreach programs. On December 12, 2017 Almaden announced the completion of a Social Impact Assessment (""SIA"") of the Ixtaca Project completed by Juan-Pablo Gudi�o of GMI Consulting (""GMI""). GMI is a Mexico City-based group which provides social and environmental consulting services to government and industry. In 2015 it was recognized by Consulting Magazine as one of the 50 most important consulting companies in Mexico. The work to complete the SIA was carried out by an interdisciplinary group of nine anthropologists, ethnologists and sociologists graduated from various universities, who lived in community homes within the Focus Area during the study to allow for ethnographic immersion and an appreciation for the local customs and way of life. The SIA sought voluntary participation from broad, diverse population groups, with specific attention to approximately one thousand persons in the Focus Area. Key points regarding the study include the following: GMI found that Almaden Minerals' consultation process complies with the Equator Principles and International Best Practices; All the fieldwork is backed up by audio, privacy notices, and photographs which demonstrate the voluntary participation of the interviewees, and their consent to be included in the study; The SIA included the participation of men, women, the elderly, boys and girls; The SIA concluded that Almaden Minerals had consulted widely with the Focus Area communities, the Ixtaca project was well understood, and that the SIA itself was successful in providing people with an opportunity to clearly express their views on the impacts of Ixtaca project development. Technical Details of the Ixtaca Drilling Program The Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones of veining are interpreted to have a north-easterly trend. Holes to date suggest that the Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones are sub vertical with local variations. This interpretation suggests that true widths range from approximately 35% of intersected widths for a -70 degree hole to 94% of intersected widths for a -20 degree hole. The drilling completed to date has traced mineralisation over 1,000 meters along this northeast trend. The Chemalaco (Northeast Extension) Zone strikes roughly north-south (340 azimuth) and dips at 55 degrees to the west. This interpretation suggests that true widths range from approximately 82% of intersected widths for a -70 degree hole to 99% of intersected widths for a -40 degree hole. The orientations of the new vein zones intersected in the holes reported today are not well understood and true widths cannot be calculated at this time. The Ixtaca gold-silver deposit is largely comprised of zones of abundant high grade epithermal veins with low base metals hosted in barren limestone. Gold and silver in these veins occurs largely as electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) and other leachable sulphides. The boundaries of these vein zones, or swarms, with un-mineralised limestone are well defined both visually and by assay results and are therefore readily modelled for geologic and resource purposes. The many individual veins and veinlets within the vein swarms branch and re-connect, as well as locally change strike and dip, pinch and swell. The wireframe models constructed to define the overall vein zones therefore contain interspersed irregular zones of barren limestone wallrock. This inclusion of limestone dilution in the vein zone wireframes results in average reserve grades of 1.17 g/t AuEq (80.5 g/t AgEq), as reported in the Company's Pre-Feasibility Study which was filed on SEDAR in May, 2017 (the ""PFS""). Nevertheless, the actual occurrence of gold and silver in the limestone hosted Main Ixtaca Zone is in the form of high grade veins and veinlets, not, for example, as widespread low grade disseminated mineralisation. These geologic and mineralogic observations have very positive mining and recovery implications as defined in the PFS released by the Company: The near surface occurrence and broad nature of the Ixtaca gold-silver deposit vein zones allow for low-cost bulk open pit mining as opposed to expensive underground methods often required for narrow individual veins. At the time of future mining, the exposure of the vein system on mine benches may allow for the visual definition between limestone waste and epithermal veining and improvement to the geologic model from that generated from exploration drill holes. An improved mine bench scale geologic model, along with appropriate ore control systems, may allow for more selective mining and waste definition of the vein swarms; The contrast between barren limestone and the non-refractory gold and silver ore and vein mineralogy allows for simple bulk gravity and flotation to remove the barren limestone to create low mass pull and volume concentrates. The PFS demonstrates that a bulk flotation concentrate of gravity tails over the mine life will average approximately 4.3 g/t gold and 390 g/t silver with a mass pull of ~8%; Leaching these limestone domain concentrates results in very high overall gold and silver recoveries (both average approximately 90%) into dor� on site without the need for expensive smelting as is the case for many base metal rich precious metal deposits. Mr. Norm Dircks, P.Geo., a qualified person (""QP"") under the meaning of NI 43-101, is the QP and project manager of Almaden's Ixtaca program and reviewed the technical information in this news release. The analyses reported were carried out at ALS Chemex Laboratories of North Vancouver using industry standard analytical techniques. For gold, samples are first analysed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy (""AAS""). Samples that return values greater than 10 g/t gold using this technique are then re-analysed by fire assay but with a gravimetric finish. Silver is first analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (""ICP-AES""). Samples that return values greater than 100 g/t silver by ICP-AES are then re analysed by HF-HNO3-HCLO4 digestion with HCL leach and ICP-AES finish. Of these samples those that return silver values greater than 1,500 g/t are further analysed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. Intervals that returned assays below detection were assigned zero values. Blanks, field duplicates and certified standards were inserted into the sample stream as part of Almaden's quality assurance and control program which complies with National Instrument 43-101 requirements.

Poliquin, chairman of Almaden stated, ""We are very encouraged to be further defining the mineralised zone beneath the PFS pit. It demonstrates the potential for the Ixtaca mine plan to grow. Ongoing drilling will continue to seek more such zones even as the engineering work and feasibility study progress."" About the Ixtaca Deposit Feasibility Program The Company has selected independent engineers Moose Mountain Technical Services (""MMTS"") to lead the feasibility study. Various feasibility-related programs are currently underway, including: Feasibility-level engineering design; Additional geotechnical evaluations in areas of infrastructure and pit slope; Continued monitoring of water quality and flow; Metallurgical test work to further refine the process flowsheet; The Comisi�n Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the state-owned electric utility of Mexico, has confirmed the availability of power from its substation located 27 km from the Ixtaca Project; Assessment of contractors suitable to complete site access road improvements required for the mine construction. MMTS is an association of Geologists, Engineers and Technicians providing experienced knowledge in Geology, Mine Engineering, and Metallurgical Services and Support to the mining industry for over 15 years. Through their network of associates, they provide an integrated team of experts and QP's. Services range from early grassroots exploration and development, block model builds, resource and reserve estimates, advanced planning and studies for mine proposals (including operational support), process design and permitting process guidance and support. MMTS has experience working on coal, gold, silver, copper, molybdenum, and tungsten deposits throughout North and South America and around the world. A list of specific projects worked on by MMTS can be found at www.moosemmc.com. About the Ixtaca Drilling Program and the Ixtaca Zone The Ixtaca Zone is a blind discovery made by the Company in 2010 on claims staked by the Company. The deposit is an epithermal gold-silver deposit, mostly hosted by veins in carbonate units and crosscutting dykes (""basement rocks"") with a minor component of disseminated mineralisation hosted in overlying volcanic rocks. The Ixtaca deposit is located in a developed part of Mexico in Puebla State, the location of significant manufacturing investments including Volkswagen and Audi plants. The deposit is accessed by paved road and is roughly 30 kilometres from an industrial park with rail service where significant manufacturers such as Kimberly Clarke have facilities. Any potential mining operation at Ixtaca would be located in an area previously logged or cleared with negligible to no current land usage. The Company has access to the entire project area and works closely with local officials and residents. The Company has employed roughly 70 people in its exploration program who live local to the Ixtaca deposit. For example, local employees have made up virtually all the drilling staff and have been trained on the job to operate the drill rigs being used at the project. The Company has implemented a comprehensive science based and objective community relations and education program for employees and all local stakeholders to transparently explain the exploration and development program underway as well as the potential impacts and benefits of any possible future mining operation at Ixtaca. The Company regards the local inhabitants to be major stakeholders in the Ixtaca deposit's future along with the Company's shareholders. Every effort is being made to create an open and clear dialogue with our stakeholders to ensure that any possible development scenarios that could evolve from the feasibility study work are properly understood and communicated throughout the course of the Company's exploration and development program. To better explain the impacts of a mining operation at Ixtaca the Company has conducted numerous tours for local residents to third party operated mines in Mexico so that interested individuals can form their own opinions of mining based on first-hand experience. The Company invites all interested parties to visit www.almadenminerals.com to find out more about our community development, education and outreach programs. On December 12, 2017 Almaden announced the completion of a Social Impact Assessment (""SIA"") of the Ixtaca Project completed by Juan-Pablo Gudi�o of GMI Consulting (""GMI""). GMI is a Mexico City-based group which provides social and environmental consulting services to government and industry. In 2015 it was recognized by Consulting Magazine as one of the 50 most important consulting companies in Mexico. The work to complete the SIA was carried out by an interdisciplinary group of nine anthropologists, ethnologists and sociologists graduated from various universities, who lived in community homes within the Focus Area during the study to allow for ethnographic immersion and an appreciation for the local customs and way of life. The SIA sought voluntary participation from broad, diverse population groups, with specific attention to approximately one thousand persons in the Focus Area. Key points regarding the study include the following: GMI found that Almaden Minerals' consultation process complies with the Equator Principles and International Best Practices; All the fieldwork is backed up by audio, privacy notices, and photographs which demonstrate the voluntary participation of the interviewees, and their consent to be included in the study; The SIA included the participation of men, women, the elderly, boys and girls; The SIA concluded that Almaden Minerals had consulted widely with the Focus Area communities, the Ixtaca project was well understood, and that the SIA itself was successful in providing people with an opportunity to clearly express their views on the impacts of Ixtaca project development. Technical Details of the Ixtaca Drilling Program The Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones of veining are interpreted to have a north-easterly trend. Holes to date suggest that the Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones are sub vertical with local variations. This interpretation suggests that true widths range from approximately 35% of intersected widths for a -70 degree hole to 94% of intersected widths for a -20 degree hole. The drilling completed to date has traced mineralisation over 1,000 meters along this northeast trend. The Chemalaco (Northeast Extension) Zone strikes roughly north-south (340 azimuth) and dips at 55 degrees to the west.

AAU,"NEW YORK, January 16, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- NEW YORK, January 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The metal mining industry is diverse and complex. According to a report by PWC, 2016 has been a turning point in the industry as fundamentals started to improve. Data shows that 2016 marked the return of mining companies to profitability. The report indicates that the Top 40 companies recorded and aggregated a net profit of $20 billion that year, after an aggregate loss of $28 billion in 2015. Major mining metals include iron, lead, copper, zinc, cobalt, and aluminum. Gold, platinum, palladium, and silver are among the precious mining metals. The role these base metals play across a wide range of industries is crucial, as these minerals affect the growth of the utilities, infrastructure, and manufacturing sectors of all countries. Boreal Metals Corp. (BMX), Silvercorp Metals Inc. SVM, +3.46% Trilogy Metals Inc. TMQ, +0.79% Almaden Minerals Ltd. AAU, +4.15% Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. FSM, +1.17%   The PWC research states, ""Valuations also climbed, especially for the traditional miners, with the trend continuing through Q1 2017 even as commodity prices remained flat. The mining industry remains a long way off the peaks of previous cycles, but it has regrouped and begun to rise again… Overall the market capitalization of the Top 40 increased in 2016 by 45 percent to $714 billion, approaching the 2014 level. Rising commodity prices played a driving role... By the end of April 2017, valuations had gained an additional $34 billion during a period when spot commodity prices were relatively flat. This data suggest that the market is valuing stronger balance sheets and solid management, suggesting that investor trust is on the rise and the recovery is sustainable."" Boreal Metals Corp. (BMX) is currently listed on the TSX Venture Exchange under the ticker 'BMX'. Just earlier today the company announced breaking news that, ""the execution of a definitive agreement with EMX Royalty Corp. (""EMX"") (nyse american:EMX)(EMX) to acquire the Modum Project (""Modum"" or the ""Project""). The Modum Project surrounds southern Norway's historic Skuterud Mine (also known as the Modum Mine), which was Europe's largest and highest grade producer of cobalt though the nineteenth century.   ""The Modum Project includes an impressive 12,000 Ha with 12 kilometers of cobalt prospective geology, with stand-alone mining potential,"" stated President and CEO Karl Antonius. ""Boreal is excited about the timely acquisition of a high grade cobalt project within an emerging battery production sector in the Nordic Region."" The Nordic Region and Battery Metals Market - The Nordic region is host to 26 active mines and seven smelters.  This region has excellent infrastructure including deep water ports with year round ice-free harbours, extensive roads, rail and access to skilled workforce, mining universities, and support services. Northvolt (http://www.northvolt.com ) has selected a location in Sweden to build Europe's biggest battery factory, which is expected to rival to Tesla's U.S. Gigafactory. Former Tesla executive Peter Carlsson's Northvolt suggests that the Swedish plant will rival the scale of the U.S. electric carmaker's Gigafactory in the Nevada desert, targeting an annual cell production equivalent to 32 gigawatt-hours by 2023. Northvolt has announced that that they plan on utilizing as much locally sourced materials as possible for battery production. Overview of Modum Project - The 13,115 Ha Modum project is located approximately 75 kilometres west of Oslo, Norway.  The Modum project is accessible year-round, with robust infrastructure including road, rail, power, and skilled labour in nearby municipalities.  The Modum property position surrounds an inlier of exploration licenses held and explored by third parties that partially cover the historic Skuterud Mine (Figure 2).  Historic mine workings, prospects and trends of mineralization extend onto the Boreal property. Modum was the primary source of the cobalt used for blue pigment in Europe during the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.  Historic production from the Skuterud Mine is estimated to have been on the order of 1,000,000 tons Co, with significant copper and gold5… History of the Modum District - Cobalt ore was discovered at the Skuterud Mine in 1772 (also known as the Modum Mine), which is the type locality of the mineral Skuterudite (CoAs3).  Production from open pits commenced in 1776, but mining transitioned underground in 1827 and continued through 1898.  The Skuterud Mine supplied over 80% of the world's commercially produced cobalt in the 1820's and 1830's with some byproduct copper.  Gold is also enriched in the Modum mineralization but there are no records for precious metal production…   Qualified Person - Daniel MacNeil, P.Geo, a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101, has read and approved all technical and scientific information related to the Modum project contained in this news release.  Mr. MacNeil is Vice President Exploration for Boreal Metals Corp. Silvercorp Metals Inc. SVM, +3.46% is a low-cost silver-producing Canadian mining company with multiple mines in China. The company recently commenced commercial production at its GC silver-lead-zinc project in Guangdong Province, its newest production base in China. While the Company's near team focus is on cost control, cash preservation, and protecting its strong balance sheet, longer term Silvercorp plans to continue its growth through future consolidation, exploration, mine development and acquisition, with a focus in China. On November 23, 2017, the company announced a Normal Course Issuer Bid to acquire up to 8,409,712, common shares, representing approximately 5% the 168,194,254 common shares issued and outstanding as of November 16, 2017.  The repurchase program will run from November 27, 2017 to November 26, 2018.  The Company is taking this action because it believes that prevailing market conditions have resulted in Silvercorp's shares being undervalued relative to the immediate and long term value of Silvercorp's portfolio of producing properties in China and other strategic investments. Trilogy Metals Inc. TMQ, +0.79% is dedicated to advancing exploration at the Upper Kobuk Mineral Projects, high-grade copper-zinc-lead-gold-silver properties in Northwest Alaska. Recently, the company announced that South32 Limited has committed to fund the US$10 million 2018 program and budget for the Bornite Project. The funds, which represent the second tranche of US$10 million, maintains the Option Agreement (see below) in good standing, and will be transferred before January 31, 2018. The 2018 program will include in-fill and off-set drilling to better define and expand the high grade copper resources at Bornite. The 2018 Program was recently approved by the joint Trilogy-South32 Technical Committee. Almaden Minerals Ltd. AAU, +4.15% owns 100% of the Tuligtic project in Puebla State, Mexico, subject to a 2.0% NSR royalty held by Almadex Minerals Limited. Tuligtic covers the Ixtaca Gold-Silver Deposit, which was discovered by Almaden in 2010. Recently, the company announced that in the Spring of 2017 it engaged an arms-length consultant to conduct a Social Impact Assessment of the Ixtaca Project. Almaden has now received a summary report of the SIA, which provides objective insight into the degree to which community members understand the Ixtaca project, and provides a valuable road map for further interactions with the communities who live local to the Ixtaca project area in Puebla State, Mexico. Fortuna Silver Mines Inc. FSM, +1.17% is a rapidly growing precious metals producer, operating two low-cost mines in Peru and Mexico and holding commanding land positions in Peru, Mexico and Argentina. Fortuna expects to increase annual production to 8.1 million ounces of silver, 52.4 thousand ounces of gold, 30.0 million pounds of lead and 41.0 million pounds of zinc in 2017. On November 8, 2017, the company reported net income of $10.3 million, Adjusted EBITDA of $30.6 million, and revenue of $64.0 million in the third quarter of 2017. Silver production at the Caylloma Mine for the third quarter of 2017 was 234,806 ounces, 24% lower than the comparable period in 2016. Lead and zinc production were 7.7 million and 11.2 million pounds, respectively; 3%, and 6% higher than the comparable quarter in 2016. Subscribe Now!

Poliquin, chairman of Almaden stated, ""We are very encouraged to be outlining this new mineralized zone in an area modelled as waste for stripping within our PFS pit, and look forward to the inclusion of this new zone in future mine plans. Ongoing drilling will continue to seek more such zones even as the engineering work and feasibility study progress."" About the Ixtaca Deposit Feasibility Program The Company has selected independent engineers Moose Mountain Technical Services (""MMTS"") to lead the feasibility study. Various feasibility-related programs are currently underway, including: Feasibility-level engineering design; Additional geotechnical evaluations in areas of infrastructure and pit slope; Continued monitoring of water quality and flow; Metallurgical test work to further refine the process flowsheet; The Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the state-owned electric utility of Mexico, has confirmed the availability of power from its substation located 27 km from the Ixtaca Project; Assessment of contractors suitable to complete site access road improvements required for the mine construction. MMTS is an association of Geologists, Engineers and Technicians providing experienced knowledge in Geology, Mine Engineering, and Metallurgical Services and Support to the mining industry for over 15 years. Through their network of associates, they provide an integrated team of experts and QPs. Services range from early grassroots exploration and development, block model builds, resource and reserve estimates, advanced planning and studies for mine proposals (including operational support), process design and permitting process guidance and support. MMTS has experience working on coal, gold, silver, copper, molybdenum, and tungsten deposits throughout North and South America and around the world. A list of specific projects worked on by MMTS can be found at www.moosemmc.com. About the Ixtaca Drilling Program and the Ixtaca Zone The Ixtaca Zone is a blind discovery made by the Company in 2010 on claims staked by the Company. The deposit is an epithermal gold-silver deposit, mostly hosted by veins in carbonate units and crosscutting dykes (""basement rocks"") with a minor component of disseminated mineralisation hosted in overlying volcanic rocks. The Ixtaca deposit is located in a developed part of Mexico in Puebla State, the location of significant manufacturing investments including Volkswagen and Audi plants. The deposit is accessed by paved road and is roughly 30 kilometres from an industrial park with rail service where significant manufacturers such as Kimberly Clarke have facilities. Any potential mining operation at Ixtaca would be located in an area previously logged or cleared with negligible to no current land usage. The Company has access to the entire project area and works closely with local officials and residents. The Company has employed roughly 70 people in its exploration program who live local to the Ixtaca deposit. For example, local employees have made up virtually all the drilling staff and have been trained on the job to operate the drill rigs being used at the project. The Company has implemented a comprehensive science based and objective community relations and education program for employees and all local stakeholders to transparently explain the exploration and development program underway as well as the potential impacts and benefits of any possible future mining operation at Ixtaca. The Company regards the local inhabitants to be major stakeholders in the Ixtaca deposit's future along with the Company's shareholders. Every effort is being made to create an open and clear dialogue with our stakeholders to ensure that any possible development scenarios that could evolve from the feasibility study work are properly understood and communicated throughout the course of the Company's exploration and development program. To better explain the impacts of a mining operation at Ixtaca the Company has conducted numerous tours for local residents to third party operated mines in Mexico so that interested individuals can form their own opinions of mining based on first-hand experience. The Company invites all interested parties to visit www.almadenminerals.com to find out more about our community development, education and outreach programs. On December 12, 2017 Almaden announced the completion of a Social Impact Assessment (""SIA"") of the Ixtaca Project completed by Juan-Pablo Gudiño of GMI Consulting (""GMI""). GMI is a Mexico City-based group which provides social and environmental consulting services to government and industry. In 2015 it was recognized by Consulting Magazine as one of the 50 most important consulting companies in Mexico. The work to complete the SIA was carried out by an interdisciplinary group of nine anthropologists, ethnologists and sociologists graduated from various universities, who lived in community homes within the Focus Area during the study to allow for ethnographic immersion and an appreciation for the local customs and way of life. The SIA sought voluntary participation from broad, diverse population groups, with specific attention to approximately one thousand persons in the Focus Area. Key points regarding the study include the following: GMI found that Almaden Minerals' consultation process complies with the Equator Principles and International Best Practices; All the fieldwork is backed up by audio, privacy notices, and photographs which demonstrate the voluntary participation of the interviewees, and their consent to be included in the study; The SIA included the participation of men, women, the elderly, boys and girls; The SIA concluded that Almaden Minerals had consulted widely with the Focus Area communities, the Ixtaca project was well understood, and that the SIA itself was successful in providing people with an opportunity to clearly express their views on the impacts of Ixtaca project development. Technical Details of the Ixtaca Drilling Program The Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones of veining are interpreted to have a north-easterly trend. Holes to date suggest that the Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones are sub vertical with local variations. This interpretation suggests that true widths range from approximately 35% of intersected widths for a -70 degree hole to 94% of intersected widths for a -20 degree hole. The drilling completed to date has traced mineralisation over 1,000 meters along this northeast trend. The Chemalaco (Northeast Extension) Zone strikes roughly north-south (340 azimuth) and dips at 55 degrees to the west. This interpretation suggests that true widths range from approximately 82% of intersected widths for a -70 degree hole to 99% of intersected widths for a -40 degree hole. The orientations of the new vein zones intersected in the holes reported today are not well understood and true widths cannot be calculated at this time. The Ixtaca gold-silver deposit is largely comprised of zones of abundant high grade epithermal veins with low base metals hosted in barren limestone. Gold and silver in these veins occurs largely as electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) and other leachable sulphides. The boundaries of these vein zones, or swarms, with un-mineralised limestone are well defined both visually and by assay results and are therefore readily modelled for geologic and resource purposes. The many individual veins and veinlets within the vein swarms branch and re-connect, as well as locally change strike and dip, pinch and swell. The wireframe models constructed to define the overall vein zones therefore contain interspersed irregular zones of barren limestone wallrock. This inclusion of limestone dilution in the vein zone wireframes results in average reserve grades of 1.17 g/t AuEq (80.5 g/t AgEq), as reported in the Company's Pre-Feasibility Study which was filed on SEDAR in May, 2017 (the ""PFS""). Nevertheless, the actual occurrence of gold and silver in the limestone hosted Main Ixtaca Zone is in the form of high grade veins and veinlets, not, for example, as widespread low grade disseminated mineralisation. These geologic and mineralogic observations have very positive mining and recovery implications as defined in the PFS released by the Company: The near surface occurrence and broad nature of the Ixtaca gold-silver deposit vein zones allow for low-cost bulk open pit mining as opposed to expensive underground methods often required for narrow individual veins. At the time of future mining, the exposure of the vein system on mine benches may allow for the visual definition between limestone waste and epithermal veining and improvement to the geologic model from that generated from exploration drill holes. An improved mine bench scale geologic model, along with appropriate ore control systems, may allow for more selective mining and waste definition of the vein swarms; The contrast between barren limestone and the non-refractory gold and silver ore and vein mineralogy allows for simple bulk gravity and flotation to remove the barren limestone to create low mass pull and volume concentrates. The PFS demonstrates that a bulk flotation concentrate of gravity tails over the mine life will average approximately 4.3 g/t gold and 390 g/t silver with a mass pull of ~8%; Leaching these limestone domain concentrates results in very high overall gold and silver recoveries (both average approximately 90%) into doré on site without the need for expensive smelting as is the case for many base metal rich precious metal deposits. Mr. Norm Dircks, P.Geo., a qualified person (""QP"") under the meaning of NI 43-101, is the QP and project manager of Almaden's Ixtaca program and reviewed the technical information in this news release. The analyses reported were carried out at ALS Chemex Laboratories of North Vancouver using industry standard analytical techniques. For gold, samples are first analysed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy (""AAS""). Samples that return values greater than 10 g/t gold using this technique are then re-analysed by fire assay but with a gravimetric finish. Silver is first analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (""ICP-AES""). Samples that return values greater than 100 g/t silver by ICP-AES are then re analysed by HF-HNO3-HCLO4 digestion with HCL leach and ICP-AES finish. Of these samples those that return silver values greater than 1,500 g/t are further analysed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. Intervals that returned assays below detection were assigned zero values. Blanks, field duplicates and certified standards were inserted into the sample stream as part of Almaden's quality assurance and control program which complies with National Instrument 43-101 requirements.

Protesters demanded that the company inform its investors that the communities are opposed to the Ixtaca mining project.   A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/da773483-19e4-4508-97cc-759ac023c630 Carrying banners and distributing leaflets that read ""Almaden Minerals is destroying our habitat"" and ""Almaden Minerals: a business that endangers the lives and water of thousands of people,"" the protesters informed passers-by and warned investors about the company's human rights and legal violations in Mexico, as well as securities complaints against it in the U.S. and Canada. ""We ask investors to stop investing in Almaden Minerals' mining project because their money is at risk. The company has lied by not telling them about our resistance to the project, the legal actions that we have taken to defend our communities, and the securities complaints we've filed before the U.S. and British Columbia securities commissions,"" said Ignacia Serrano, community member from Ixtacamaxtitl�n. Notably the company's stock performance recently hit its lowest point in the past five years. The protest marked the end of a week-long, cross-country delegation of four community leaders from the affected region - Ignacia Serrano, Alejandro Marreros, Francisca Zamora, and Ignacio Carmona, accompanied by the Latin American not-for-profit organization PODER - who held meetings in Canada with government officials and politicians from Global Affairs, International Trade, and parliamentary committees, as well as mining investors, trade unions, indigenous communities, and the news media. This delegation shared findings from Mexico's first ever community-led Human Rights Impact Assessment, which outlines the devastation and threats to the region's water supply, ecosystem, and residents' health should the Ixtaca Project move forward, as well as legal and regulatory violations by the company in Mexico, in addition to material misrepresentations of facts to investors.

AAU,"Dec 12, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- VANCOUVER, BC--(Marketwired - December 12, 2017) - Almaden Minerals Ltd. (""Almaden"" or ""the Company"")(AMM) (nyse american:AAU) (nyse mkt:AAU) is pleased to announce that in the Spring of 2017 it engaged an arms-length consultant to conduct a Social Impact Assessment (""SIA"") of the Ixtaca Project. Almaden has now received a summary report of the SIA, which provides objective insight into the degree to which community members understand the Ixtaca project, and provides a valuable road map for further interactions with the communities who live local to the Ixtaca project area in Puebla State, Mexico. The SIA was completed by Juan-Pablo Gudiño of GMI Consulting (""GMI""). GMI is a Mexico City-based group which provides social and environmental consulting services to government and industry. In 2015 it was recognized by Consulting Magazine as one of the 50 most important consulting companies in Mexico. Juan-Pablo Gudiño is a lawyer with a Doctorate in Constitutional Law with a specialty in Human Rights, Environment, and Economics, with twenty years experience in environmental, constitutional, human rights, and labour law. He has attended hearings and cases before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and trials before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights. He has also represented the Mexican State and presented Mexico's position before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, headquartered in Washington, regarding Megaprojects and Indigenous Consultation and Energy Reform, resulting in the acceptance of the country's position. Juan-Pablo has participated in more than 30 consultation processes. In Mexico, only the energy industry requires completion of a SIA (known in Mexico as a Tràmite Evaluación de Impacto Social, or ""EVIS"") as part of the permitting process. The purpose of these studies is to identify the people in the area of influence of a project (""Focus Area""), and assess the potential positive and negative consequences of project development to assist in the development of mitigation measures and the formation of social investment plans. To Almaden's knowledge, this is the first time such a study has been completed in the minerals industry in Mexico, and as such reflects the Company's commitment to best national and international standards in Ixtaca project development. The work to complete the SIA was carried out by an interdisciplinary group of nine anthropologists, ethnologists and sociologists graduated from various universities, who lived in community homes within the Focus Area during the study to allow for ethnographic immersion and an appreciation for the local customs and way of life. The SIA sought voluntary participation from broad, diverse population groups, with specific attention to approximately one thousand persons in the Focus Area, where it consulted with every adult. Key points regarding the study include the following: - GMI found that Almaden Minerals' consultation process complies with the Equator Principles and International Best Practices; - All the fieldwork is backed up by audio, privacy notices, and photographs which demonstrate the voluntary participation of the interviewees, and their consent to be included in the study; - The SIA included the participation of men, women, the elderly, boys and girls; - The SIA concluded that Almaden Minerals had consulted widely with the Focus Area communities, the Ixtaca project was well understood, and that the SIA itself was successful in providing people with an opportunity to clearly express their views on the impacts of Ixtaca project development. Duane Poliquin, Chairman of Almaden, commented, ""This highly credible study is a fundamental step towards project development. We are pleased that our active community programs have accomplished the primary objective of ensuring that the local communities understand our project. With the benefit of this report, we can now turn our minds to a social investment plan to accompany the mine, which accommodates the needs identified in this process, and best ensures local people are in a position to benefit as much as possible from Ixtaca project development.""

AAU,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia, Dec 11, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- The following is a statement by PODER A delegation of Mexican communities and human rights advocates visited Canada last week to urge the Government of Canada and investors to prevent human rights violations associated with Vancouver company Almaden Minerals' mining exploration project in the region of Ixtacamaxtitl�n, Puebla, Mexico. Four residents of the region - Ignacia Serrano, Alejandro Marreros, Francisca Zamora, and Ignacio Carmona, accompanied by not-for-profit organization PODER - met with government officials and politicians from Global Affairs, International Trade, and parliamentary committees, as well as mining investors, trade unions and indigenous communities in order to share findings from Mexico's first ever community-led Human Rights Impact Assessment (HRIA), which outlines current devastation and threats to the region's water supply, ecosystem, and residents' health should the Ixtaca Project move forward. Carried out with the support of international experts and in collaboration with the affected community, the HRIA concludes that Almaden Minerals has not communicated to investors the legal procedures initiated by the communities that oppose the project, including a nullity trial seeking to cancel the company's exploration permit for having violated Mexican environmental regulations, a request to cancel its mining concessions, and complaints before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the British Columbia Securities Commission. ""We have asked the Government of Canada to intervene with Almaden Minerals to stop violating the human rights of communities in Mexico. We welcome the creation of an Ombudsperson for communities affected by Canadian mining companies as long as it's independent, has investigative power, and guarantees access to remedy,"" says community member Alejandro Marreros. The delegation's visit to Canada follows months of calls for greater accountability for Canadian companies, including an open letter from 180 non-government organizations in 2016, and a United Nations assessment in 2017 that Canada should deepen its protection for human rights.

AAU,"Nov 21, 2017 (Marketwired via COMTEX) -- VANCOUVER, BC--(Marketwired - November 21, 2017) - Almaden Minerals Ltd. (""Almaden"" or ""the Company"") (AMM) (nyse mkt:AAU) (nyse american:AAU) is pleased to announce new assay results from Almaden's ongoing exploration and development program at the Company's Tuligtic project, Mexico. One drill rig is focused on step-out exploration drilling outside of the established resource area, while the second drill rig has completed holes for metallurgical samples related to the ongoing Feasibility Study, and is now testing new zones within the Pre-Feasibililty Study (""PFS"") pit. Today's results are from holes TU-17-518 and 520 which were drilled to follow-up hole TU-17-504 (announced August 23, 2017) that intersected new and significant mineralisation in an upper portion of the PFS pit which was modelled as waste material in the Company's PFS. Holes TU-17-518 and 520 confirm this discovery of a new zone of mineralisation in volcanic and limestone. Highlights include the following intercepts: Hole TU-17-518    SECTION 10+650 EAST Az. 150, Dip -57 23.00 meters @ 0.45 g/t Au and 1.0 g/t Ag      38.60 meters @ 7.92 g/t Au (2.84 g/t with 1 sample cut(1)) and 14.9 g/t Ag  Including                                 23.50 meters @ 12.70 g/t Au (4.36 g/t with 1 sample cut(1)) and 20.7 g/t Ag And                                       5.00 meters @ 51.45 g/t Au (12.25 with 1 sample cut(1)) and 58.4 g/t Ag And                                       1.00 meters @ 237.00 g/t Au and 232.0 g/t Ag   (1) gold assays over 41 g/t were cut to 41 g/t.

Poliquin, chairman of Almaden stated, ""These results again show the potential of the Ixtaca gold silver deposit to grow. As I have stated before, while Ixtaca is a prominent new discovery of gold and silver reserves, we are clearly only at the beginning of the discovery cycle at this project. We have a two-pronged approach. On the one hand we are focussed on developing the Ixtaca deposit into a significant precious metals producer in Mexico, and engineering work and studies on a Feasibility Study are progressing well. At the same time we have in front of us the opportunity for additional discovery and resource growth. We are at the top of a fully preserved epithermal system and over the next several months exploration drilling will also test for additional vein zones beneath alteration elsewhere on the project."" About the Ixtaca Deposit Feasibility Program The Company has selected independent engineers Moose Mountain Technical Services (""MMTS"") to lead the feasibility study. Various feasibility-related programs are currently underway, including: Feasibility-level engineering design; Additional geotechnical evaluations in areas of infrastructure and pit slope; Continued monitoring of water quality and flow; Metallurgical test work to further refine the process flowsheet; The Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the state-owned electric utility of Mexico, has confirmed the availability of power from its substation located 27 km from the Ixtaca Project; Assessment of contractors suitable to complete site access road improvements required for the mine construction. MMTS is an association of Geologists, Engineers and Technicians providing experienced knowledge in Geology, Mine Engineering, and Metallurgical Services and Support to the mining industry for over 15 years. Through their network of associates, they provide an integrated team of experts and QP's. Services range from early grassroots exploration and development, block model builds, resource and reserve estimates, advanced planning and studies for mine proposals (including operational support), process design and permitting process guidance and support. MMTS has experience working on coal, gold, silver, copper, molybdenum, and tungsten deposits throughout North and South America and around the world. A list of specific projects worked on by MMTS can be found at www.moosemmc.com. About the Ixtaca Drilling Program and the Ixtaca Zone The Ixtaca Zone is a blind discovery made by the Company in 2010 on claims staked by the Company. The deposit is an epithermal gold-silver deposit, mostly hosted by veins in carbonate units and crosscutting dykes (""basement rocks"") with a minor component of disseminated mineralisation hosted in overlying volcanic rocks. The Ixtaca deposit is located in a developed part of Mexico in Puebla State, the location of significant manufacturing investments including Volkswagen and Audi plants. The deposit is accessed by paved road and is roughly 30 kilometres from an industrial park with rail service where significant manufacturers such as Kimberly Clarke have facilities. Any potential mining operation at Ixtaca would be located in an area previously logged or cleared with negligible to no current land usage. The Company has access to the entire project area and works closely with local officials and residents. The Company has employed roughly 70 people in its exploration program who live local to the Ixtaca deposit. For example, local employees have made up virtually all the drilling staff and have been trained on the job to operate the drill rigs being used at the project. The Company has implemented a comprehensive science based and objective community relations and education program for employees and all local stakeholders to transparently explain the exploration and development program underway as well as the potential impacts and benefits of any possible future mining operation at Ixtaca. The Company regards the local inhabitants to be major stakeholders in the Ixtaca deposit's future along with the Company's shareholders. Every effort is being made to create an open and clear dialogue with our stakeholders to ensure that any possible development scenarios that could evolve from the feasibility study work are properly understood and communicated throughout the course of the Company's exploration and development program. To better explain the impacts of a mining operation at Ixtaca the Company has conducted numerous tours for local residents to third party operated mines in Mexico so that interested individuals can form their own opinions of mining based on first-hand experience. The Company invites all interested parties to visit www.almadenminerals.com to find out more about our community development, education and outreach programs. Technical Details of the Ixtaca Drilling Program The Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones of veining are interpreted to have a north-easterly trend. Holes to date suggest that the Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones are sub vertical with local variations. This interpretation suggests that true widths range from approximately 35% of intersected widths for a -70 degree hole to 94% of intersected widths for a -20 degree hole. The drilling completed to date has traced mineralisation over 1,000 meters along this northeast trend. The Chemalaco (Northeast Extension) Zone strikes roughly north-south (340 azimuth) and dips at 55 degrees to the west. This interpretation suggests that true widths range from approximately 82% of intersected widths for a -70 degree hole to 99% of intersected widths for a -40 degree hole. The orientations of the new vein zones intersected in the holes reported today are not well understood and true widths cannot be calculated at this time. The Ixtaca gold-silver deposit is largely comprised of zones of abundant high grade epithermal veins with low base metals hosted in barren limestone. Gold and silver in these veins occurs largely as electrum (an alloy of gold and silver) and other leachable sulphides. The boundaries of these vein zones, or swarms, with un-mineralised limestone are well defined both visually and by assay results and are therefore readily modelled for geologic and resource purposes. The many individual veins and veinlets within the vein swarms branch and re-connect, as well as locally change strike and dip, pinch and swell. The wireframe models constructed to define the overall vein zones therefore contain interspersed irregular zones of barren limestone wallrock. This inclusion of limestone dilution in the vein zone wireframes results in average reserve grades of 1.17 g/t AuEq (80.5 g/t AgEq), as reported in the Company's Pre-Feasibility Study which was filed on SEDAR in May, 2017 (the ""PFS""). Nevertheless, the actual occurrence of gold and silver in the limestone hosted Main Ixtaca Zone is in the form of high grade veins and veinlets, not, for example, as widespread low grade disseminated mineralisation. These geologic and mineralogic observations have very positive mining and recovery implications as defined in the PFS released by the Company: The near surface occurrence and broad nature of the Ixtaca gold-silver deposit vein zones allow for low-cost bulk open pit mining as opposed to expensive underground methods often required for narrow individual veins. At the time of future mining, the exposure of the vein system on mine benches may allow for the visual definition between limestone waste and epithermal veining and improvement to the geologic model from that generated from exploration drill holes. An improved mine bench scale geologic model, along with appropriate ore control systems, may allow for more selective mining and waste definition of the vein swarms; The contrast between barren limestone and the non-refractory gold and silver ore and vein mineralogy allows for simple bulk gravity and flotation to remove the barren limestone to create low mass pull and volume concentrates. The PFS demonstrates that a bulk flotation concentrate of gravity tails over the mine life will average approximately 4.3 g/t gold and 390 g/t silver with a mass pull of ~8%; Leaching these limestone domain concentrates results in very high overall gold and silver recoveries (both average approximately 90%) into doré on site without the need for expensive smelting as is the case for many base metal rich precious metal deposits. Mr. Norm Dircks, P.Geo., a qualified person (""QP"") under the meaning of NI 43-101, is the QP and project manager of Almaden's Ixtaca program and reviewed the technical information in this news release. The analyses reported were carried out at ALS Chemex Laboratories of North Vancouver using industry standard analytical techniques. For gold, samples are first analysed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy (""AAS""). Samples that return values greater than 10 g/t gold using this technique are then re-analysed by fire assay but with a gravimetric finish. Silver is first analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (""ICP-AES""). Samples that return values greater than 100 g/t silver by ICP-AES are then re analysed by HF-HNO3-HCLO4 digestion with HCL leach and ICP-AES finish. Of these samples those that return silver values greater than 1,500 g/t are further analysed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. Intervals that returned assays below detection were assigned zero values. Blanks, field duplicates and certified standards were inserted into the sample stream as part of Almaden's quality assurance and control program which complies with National Instrument 43-101 requirements.

The PFS demonstrates that a bulk flotation concentrate of gravity tails over the mine life will average approximately 4.3 g/t gold and 390 g/t silver with a mass pull of ~8%; Leaching these limestone domain concentrates results in very high overall gold and silver recoveries (both average approximately 90%) into doré on site without the need for expensive smelting as is the case for many base metal rich precious metal deposits. J.D. Poliquin, chairman of Almaden stated, ""These results again show the continuity of the Ixtaca Zone gold silver mineralisation. We are focussed on developing the Ixtaca deposit into a significant precious metals producer in Mexico, and engineering work and studies on a Feasibility Study are progressing well. We are at the top of a fully preserved epithermal system and over the next several months exploration drilling will also test for additional vein zones beneath alteration elsewhere on the project."" About the Ixtaca Deposit Feasibility Program The Company has selected independent engineers Moose Mountain Technical Services (""MMTS"") to lead the feasibility study. Various feasibility-related programs are currently underway, including: Feasibility-level engineering design; Additional geotechnical evaluations in areas of infrastructure and pit slope; Continued monitoring of water quality and flow; Metallurgical test work to further refine the process flowsheet; The Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the state-owned electric utility of Mexico, has confirmed the availability of power from its substation located 27 km from the Ixtaca Project; Assessment of contractors suitable to complete site access road improvements required for the mine construction. MMTS is an association of Geologists, Engineers and Technicians providing experienced knowledge in Geology, Mine Engineering, and Metallurgical Services and Support to the mining industry for over 15 years. Through their network of associates, they provide an integrated team of experts and QP's.

About the Ixtaca Drilling Program and the Ixtaca Zone The Ixtaca Zone is a blind discovery made by the Company in 2010 on claims staked by the Company. The deposit is an epithermal gold-silver deposit, mostly hosted by veins in carbonate units and crosscutting dykes (""basement rocks"") with a minor component of disseminated mineralisation hosted in overlying volcanic rocks. The Ixtaca deposit is located in a developed part of Mexico in Puebla State, the location of significant manufacturing investments including Volkswagen and Audi plants. The deposit is accessed by paved road and is roughly 30 kilometres from an industrial park with rail service where significant manufacturers such as Kimberly Clarke have facilities. Any potential mining operation at Ixtaca would be located in an area previously logged or cleared with negligible to no current land usage. The Company has access to the entire project area and works closely with local officials and residents. The Company has employed roughly 70 people in its exploration program who live local to the Ixtaca deposit. For example, local employees have made up virtually all the drilling staff and have been trained on the job to operate the drill rigs being used at the project. The Company has implemented a comprehensive science based and objective community relations and education program for employees and all local stakeholders to transparently explain the exploration and development program underway as well as the potential impacts and benefits of any possible future mining operation at Ixtaca. The Company regards the local inhabitants to be major stakeholders in the Ixtaca deposit's future along with the Company's shareholders. Every effort is being made to create an open and clear dialogue with our stakeholders to ensure that any possible development scenarios that could evolve from the feasibility study work are properly understood and communicated throughout the course of the Company's exploration and development program. To better explain the impacts of a mining operation at Ixtaca the Company has conducted numerous tours for local residents to third party operated mines in Mexico so that interested individuals can form their own opinions of mining based on first-hand experience. The Company invites all interested parties to visit www.almadenminerals.com to find out more about our community development, education and outreach programs. Technical Details of the Ixtaca Drilling Program The Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones of veining are interpreted to have a north-easterly trend. Holes to date suggest that the Main Ixtaca and Ixtaca North Zones are sub vertical with local variations. This interpretation suggests that true widths range from approximately 35% of intersected widths for a -70 degree hole to 94% of intersected widths for a -20 degree hole. The drilling completed to date has traced mineralisation over 1,000 meters along this northeast trend. The Chemalaco (Northeast Extension) Zone strikes roughly north-south (340 azimuth) and dips at 55 degrees to the west. This interpretation suggests that true widths range from approximately 82% of intersected widths for a -70 degree hole to 99% of intersected widths for a -40 degree hole. The orientations of the new vein zones intersected in the holes reported today are not well understood and true widths cannot be calculated at this time. Mr. Norm Dircks, P.Geo., a qualified person (""QP"") under the meaning of NI 43-101, is the QP and project manager of Almaden's Ixtaca program and reviewed the technical information in this news release. The analyses reported were carried out at ALS Chemex Laboratories of North Vancouver using industry standard analytical techniques. For gold, samples are first analysed by fire assay and atomic absorption spectroscopy (""AAS""). Samples that return values greater than 10 g/t gold using this technique are then re-analysed by fire assay but with a gravimetric finish. Silver is first analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Atomic Emission Spectroscopy (""ICP-AES""). Samples that return values greater than 100 g/t silver by ICP-AES are then re analysed by HF-HNO3-HCLO4 digestion with HCL leach and ICP-AES finish. Of these samples those that return silver values greater than 1,500 g/t are further analysed by fire assay with a gravimetric finish. Intervals that returned assays below detection were assigned zero values. Blanks, field duplicates and certified standards were inserted into the sample stream as part of Almaden's quality assurance and control program which complies with National Instrument 43-101 requirements.

The Ixtaca deposit was discovered in 2010 beneath a large area of largely barren clay alteration which has been confirmed subsequently to represent the upper portions of a gold and silver bearing epithermal vein system. Since the discovery Almaden has focussed its efforts on the development of the Ixtaca Zone, however today's results clearly show the potential for additional mineralisation, not only proximal to the deposit, but more broadly project wide beneath the high level clay alteration. J.D. Poliquin, chairman of Almaden stated, ""When low sulphidation epithermal precious metal deposits are formed, metal bearing fluid rises from depth, filling fractures with quartz, calcite and precious metal minerals. In the highest mineralised areas of the system, the same fluids can be dispersed through multiple smaller fractures to form a sheeted vein zone or swarm such as we have at the Main Ixtaca Zone. The veinlets that comprise the Main Ixtaca Zone individually carry very elevated gold and silver grades, but as they are spread out within a broad area of limestone host rock, the overall average grade is lower. To have a completely preserved system as at Ixtaca is exciting but unusual as many epithermal vein systems in Mexico have been eroded down to the feeder veins where base metals are often abundant, making them by metal content lead and zinc deposits with high precious metal credits. The intercepts reported today further demonstrate the potential for large tonnage sheeted vein zones, as well as bonanza feeder vein zones below. Our 2017 exploration drill program is targeting both."" About the Ixtaca Deposit Feasibility Program The Company has selected independent engineers Moose Mountain Technical Services (""MMTS"") and Knight Piesold Ltd. (""KP"") to prepare a feasibility study. Various feasibility-related programs are currently underway, including: Feasibility-level engineering design; Additional geotechnical evaluations in areas of infrastructure and pit slope; Continued monitoring of water quality and flow; Metallurgical test work to further refine the process flowsheet; The Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), the state-owned electric utility of Mexico, has confirmed the availability of power from its substation located 27 km from the Ixtaca Project. CFE has been engaged to complete engineering studies required to deliver power; Assessment of contractors suitable to complete site access road improvements required for the mine construction.

Other Ixtaca Project Developments Almaden confirms that it recently made the US$2.0 million option payment to the vendor of the Rock Creek Mill. A further payment of US$3.75 million is due in June, 2018, at which point the Company will have completed all of the payments required for purchase of the mill. Almaden has engaged Dynamic Engineering Services (""Dynamic""), which specializes in the dismantlement and transportation of large industrial sites, as project lead for the transport of the Rock Creek mill from Nome, Alaska to Mexico. Dynamic currently has a team at the Rock Creek site preparing for next year's move. Preparations involve establishing a camp for personnel, arranging for delivery of initial containers to site this summer, engaging with the Nome port authorities, preparing the mill for dismantlement, and confirming the availability and working order of equipment required for disassembling the plant. As part of this process, Almaden recently purchased a used mobile crane which is currently at the site, for US$50,000. The Company has completed the preparation of its Environmental Impact Assessment (MIA) for the Ixtaca project, and has provided the document to third party consultants for review. Based on guidance from this third party, Almaden anticipates submitting these permits in the third quarter. In its technical report on the Ixtaca project, which was prepared in accordance with National Instrument 43-101 and filed on SEDAR on May 17, 2017, Almaden's technical consultants identified the potential for the dominant host rock at the Ixtaca project -- limestone -- to be a valuable by-product of the gold and silver production. A large portion of the Ixtaca waste rock is non-mineralized limestone. Geo-chemical and geo-mechanical tests indicate that most of the limestone waste rock is likely suitable for use as an aggregate. The high calcium content also makes it potentially suitable for agriculture. Given Ixtaca's location near a significant industrial park and along major highways linking Mexico City to Puebla City, the technical consultants have recommended that the >60 million tonne per year Mexican aggregate market should be investigated. In addition, chemical analysis of the limestone flotation tailings shows high calcium content with low impurities. The technical consultants have also recommended an investigation to determine if the Ixtaca flotation tailings are a potential feedstock for a cement production process. Almaden intends to engage a third party specialist in aggregate products to explore the potential by-product contribution of this aggregate material. The potential to find a market for these by-products could have significant benefits for the project, both through their contribution to the revenue stream and through the decreased downstream handling of the un-mineralised waste rock.
