OCUL,"Investing in the initial public offerings of biotechnology companies can be a crapshoot. That may be the lesson for investors in ProNAi Therapeutics Inc. US:DNAI a biotechnology company working on cancer treatment therapies, which suffered a 68% plunge in its stock Monday, after it suspended development of its main drug. The stock move underscores the inherent risk in the biotech market, where investors are often betting on a company with little insight into its sustainability. “It’s basically a roll of the dice,” Kathleen Smith, principal at Renaissance Capital, a manger of IPO-focused ETFs, told MarketWatch. “It should be ‘buyer beware’ for anyone.” ProNAi Therapeutics went public on July 16, 2015 and listed the drug, PNT2258, as its sole product candidate in its prospectus. “Our business and future success depends on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize our only clinical product candidate, PNT2258,” the company wrote in its prospectus. FactSet On Monday, ProNAi said Phase 2 trial results for the drug weren't “robust enough” to continue product development and that it was working to “determine future steps” for its platform, DNAi. Earlier this year, the IPO market was led by biotechnology companies, which didn’t have a commercial product to their name. The companies often go public to raise funds for clinical trials of the products. Because of the early stages of these companies and the lack of realized product, Smith said, it is risky for investors and hard for analysts to even evaluate which ones will succeed. Additionally, biotech companies have to deal with factors such as approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and emerging competitors. Ocular Therapeutix Inc. OCUL, -0.77% which went public in June 2015 and was developing a drug for treatment of chronic allergic conjunctivitis, saw its stock tank 43% Monday, after it announced that the second trial of one of the drug failed to achieve its goal. Graphic embed is no longer available. The other issue is that these companies have been helped to market thanks to heavy insider buying. The insider buying means that the first day of trading may bring a big return for investors, but that often is a false indicator of the stock’s long-term potential. “The [stock] may go up initially because the float is limited, but it can get disconnected from their sustainable value,” Smith said. For example, shares of ProNAi opened at $28.68 on its first day of trading, then rose to a high of $33.75, nearly double the stock’s issue price of $17. Less than a year later, it closed just above $2, or about 90% below its IPO price. Other investors may be buying biotech shares just for those short-term returns, Smith said. Overall, her firm believes investors in these biotech stocks are either hedge funds or those who “take a portfolio approach” and invest in several biotechs in the hope that one will do well. So far this year her firm has counted 20 health care initial public offerings, which are up an average of 29% from the IPO issue price, according to Renaissance Capital. But, Smith said she sees this as a short-term gain led by just a few success stories--the 78 health care IPOs from 2015 are down an average of 25.4% from their IPO prices. “As time goes on the blow ups happen,” Smith said.

OCUL,"Ocular Therapeutix Inc. OCUL, -0.61% said Monday that a second Phase 3 trial of its treatment for chronic allergic conjunctivitis failed to achieve its single primary endpoint.

OCUL,"The recent carnage in biotechnology stocks has created a number of opportunities for investors to buy into the sector on the cheap, according to RBC Capital. Analysts at RBC have compiled a list of biotech stocks trading below, or just slightly above cash levels, which could signal a “floor” for the stocks, or make them potential buyout targets for value investors. A stock trading at a company’s cash level implies the market is assigning little or no value to the biotech assets they own. “Broadly speaking, many investors can be attracted to this type of stock because it implies that a biotech asset may be getting little to no value if it’s trading at cash on the balance sheet, which may be theoretically irrational given there should be some value for a drug and could work driving upside from current levels,” RBC analysts wrote in a research note to clients. After screening the stocks of about 50 biotech companies covered by RBC, the analysts found three that were trading below cash levels: • SteadyMed Ltd. STDY, -12.31% • Endocyte, Inc. ECYT, -1.76% • Arbutus Biopharma Corporation ABUS, +0.00% FactSet Among other stocks RBC found to be trading at a fraction of cash levels: • Esperion Therapeutics Inc. OREX, +66.16% --0.3-times cash • Zafgen Inc. ZFGN, -2.68% --0.3-times cash • Scynexis Inc. SCYX, -4.10% --0.3-times cash • Nabriva Therapeutics AG NBRV, -2.98% --0.4-times cash • Aptose Biosciences Inc. APTO, -3.48% --0.6-times cash • Ocular Therapeutix Inc. OCUL, -0.46% --0.6-times cash • VIVUS Inc. VVUS, -2.81% --0.7-times cash • Orexigen Therapeutics Inc.  OREX, +66.16% --0.9-times cash Biotechnology stocks have been pummeled over the past six months, as concerns over the health of the broader stock market have prompted many investors to unload holdings seen as riskier investments. The SPDR S&P Biotech exchange-traded fund XBI, -3.21%  has tumbled 34% over the past six months, while the S&P 500 index SPX, -2.20%  has slipped 8.6%. Of the above stocks, the biggest loser over the past six months has been Zafgen’s shares, which have plunged 77% in six months, while the best performer was Endocyte’s stock, which has dropped just 31%. Nabriva’s stock has tumbled 42% since its first day of trading on Sept. 18, 2015. Being cheap doesn’t mean the stocks can’t get cheaper, RBC cautioned. Many biotech companies are burning through cash, meaning their stocks could start trading further above cash levels over time. “Separately as a risk, the bear case is that if companies start trading below 1 year of cash and could require financing, investors start to catch on and if the capital markets become challenging, these stocks can face downward pressure with financing overhangs,” the analysts wrote.

OCUL,"The market for initial public offerings by companies funded by venture-capital firms is red hot, and the high valuations for some offerings have alarmed even some normally bullish tech investors, as reported by David Weidner. Thomson Reuters said Wednesday there were 23 venture-backed IPOs in the third quarter, the sixth straight quarter of 20 or more offerings. Six years into a bull market, many investors feel “left out” if they are unable to jump into a newly listed firm’s shares right out of the gate. The highest-profile IPO this year was pulled off in style by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. BABA, -2.93%  on Sept. 19, with the shares opening at $92.70, 36% above the IPO price of $68. Alibaba’s shares closed at $86.10 Wednesday, so shareholders who got in early are sitting on a big gain, while those who went in after trading started in New York may have a different story to tell. Before getting caught up in the excitement of an IPO, you need to be very careful when considering your objective. Have you read the company’s offering filings? Do you believe in its products, services and plans for expansion? Are you expecting to make a killing by selling your shares on the first day, or do you expect to be a longer-term shareholder? For some industries, such as biotechnology, it is common for IPOs to take place years before a company expects to generate meaningful revenue, let alone profits. All may be riding on the success of research and clinical trials that is a long way from completion. Some investors who felt “burned” by Facebook’s FB, -2.04%  May 18, 2012, IPO, when the stock sank 16% during the first week of trading, may have bought the shares because they enjoyed using the social-networking site, having done no other research. Or maybe they took part because their broker suggested they would make an easy gain. Facebook investors who didn’t panic have seen the stock double from the IPO price of $38 (through Wednesday’s close at $76.55). That’s an excellent return for a commitment of about 2 1/2 years.

OCUL,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and related financing, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and should be read together with the ""Risk Factors"" section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the formulation, development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using our proprietary, bioresorbable hydrogel platform technology. We use this technology to tailor duration and amount of delivery of a range of therapeutic agents of varying duration in our product candidates. We incorporate U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved therapeutic agents, including small molecules and proteins, into our hydrogel technology with the goal of providing extended delivery of drug to the eye. We believe that our extended delivery technology allows us to treat conditions and diseases of both the front and the back of the eye and can be administered through a range of different modalities including intracanalicular inserts, intracameral implants and intravitreal implants. We have product candidates in clinical and preclinical development applying this technology to treat post-surgical ocular pain and inflammation, allergic conjunctivitis, dry eye disease, glaucoma and ocular hypertension, and wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD, among other conditions. Our lead product candidates are DEXTENZA (dexamethasone insert), for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain and inflammation, allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease, and OTX-TP (travoprost insert), for the reduction of intraocular pressure, or IOP, in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension. Both product candidates are extended-delivery, drug-eluting, preservative-free intracanalicular inserts that are placed into the canaliculus through a natural opening called the punctum located in the inner portion of the eyelid near the nose. We also have a preclinical product development candidate that is injected into the intracameral space for the reduction of IOP in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension where greater IOP reduction is needed. We also have in development two programs that are beginning human clinical trials: OTX-TIC, an intracameral travoprost implant for the reduction of IOP in patients with moderate to severe glaucoma and ocular hypertension; and OTX-TKI, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor intravitreal injection by fine gauge needle, delivering a hydrogel-based, anti-angiogenic formulation that releases the therapeutic agent for the treatment of wet AMD. Currently, we have not enrolled a patient in either program. Finally, we continue our collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel in combination with Regeneron's VEGF inhibitor, aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. In addition to our ongoing drug product development, we currently market our sole commercial product ReSure Sealant, a hydrogel-based ophthalmic wound sealant approved by the FDA to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery. ReSure Sealant is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use. DEXTENZA(TM) (dexamethasone insert) Our most advanced product candidate, DEXTENZA, incorporates the FDA-approved corticosteroid dexamethasone as an active pharmaceutical ingredient into a hydrogel-based, drug-eluting intracanalicular insert. In September 2015, we submitted to the FDA a New Drug Application, or NDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. In July 2016, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for DEXTENZA. This CRL pertained to deficiencies in manufacturing process and controls identified during a pre-NDA approval inspection of our manufacturing facility. In January 2017, we resubmitted our NDA. Following a re-inspection of manufacturing operations by the FDA which was completed in May 2017, we received an FDA Form 483 containing inspectional observations focused on manufacturing processes and analytical testing related to the Table of Contents manufacture of drug product for commercial production. In July 2017, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding our NDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain, which states that the FDA has determined that it cannot approve the NDA in its present form. FDA concerns included deficiencies in manufacturing processes and analytical testing related to manufacturing of drug product identified during the pre-NDA approval inspection and states that the FDA has determined that it cannot approve the NDA in its present form. We have corresponded with the FDA regarding these inspectional observations and are working to resolve the issues that have been identified. In May 2017 we submitted our initial response to the Form 483 and in November 2017 we submitted our responses to the FDA's remaining inspectional observations in an effort to close out the items identified in the Form 483. Subject to satisfactorily addressing the FDA inspectional observations and demonstrating consistency in our commercial stage manufacturing process, we plan to resubmit our NDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain in the first half of 2018. Adequate resolution of the outstanding Form 483 inspectional observations and the final decision as to the adequacy of our manufacturing processes are determined by the FDA with input from the Office of Process and Facilities within its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, as part of the NDA review process, and are necessary prior to NDA approval. If DEXTENZA is approved for marketing, we are considering potential commercialization options available for DEXTENZA in the United States, including building our own highly targeted, key account sales force that would focus on the ambulatory surgical centers responsible for the largest volumes of cataract surgery. We have completed three Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain and inflammation. The data from two of these three completed Phase 3 clinical trials and a prior Phase 2 clinical trial are being used to support our NDA for post-surgical ocular pain. Subject to receiving approval for the pain indication, we plan to submit an NDA supplement, or sNDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation. We have also completed two Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. In October 2015, we announced topline results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis, and in June 2016 we announced topline results of our second Phase 3 clinical trial for this indication. Finally, DEXTENZA completed a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of dry eye disease, with topline results announced in December 2015. OTX-TP (travoprost insert) Our second product candidate, OTX-TP, incorporates travoprost, an FDA-approved prostaglandin analog, or PGA, that reduces elevated IOP as its active pharmaceutical ingredient, into a hydrogel-based, drug-eluting intracanalicular insert. This preservative-free insert is designed to elute drug for up to 90 days. OTX-TP is being developed as a treatment to lower IOP in patients with mild to moderate primary open angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We reported topline results from a Phase 2b clinical trial for this indication in October 2015. We completed an End-of-Phase 2 review with the FDA in April 2016 and initiated the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials of OTX-TP in September 2016 and initiated the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials of OTX-TP in September 2016. We expect our first Phase 3 trial to enroll approximately 550 patients at 50 sites in the United States. Based on discussions with the FDA, the first Phase 3 clinical trial design will include an OTX-TP treatment arm and a placebo-controlled comparator arm that will use a non-drug eluting hydrogel-based intracanalicular insert. There will not be a requirement for either a timolol comparator or a validation arm. No eye drops, placebo or active, will be administered in either the OTX-TP treatment arm or the placebo-controlled arm. The primary efficacy endpoint will be superiority in the reduction of IOP from baseline in the OTX-TP treatment arm compared to the placebo arm at three diurnal time points at each of three measurement dates, 2, 6 and 12 weeks. We expect that the FDA will require that OTX-TP show both a statistically superior reduction of IOP, compared to the placebo and a clinically meaningful reduction of IOP prior to granting marketing approval. We expect topline efficacy data from the first Phase 3 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2018. We do not intend to initiate the second Phase 3 clinical trial until we receive data from the first Phase 3 clinical trial and may determine to discuss the results of this first Phase 3 clinical trial with the FDA prior to initiating a second Phase 3 clinical trial. Given the anticipated use of OTX-TP as a chronic therapy, we will need to generate six-month (300 patients) and one year (100 patients) safety data during either the first or second Phase 3 clinical trial to support our product registration. OTX-TIC (travoprost implant) OTX-TIC (travoprost implant) is our product candidate for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe glaucoma and ocular hypertension. OTX-TIC is a bioresorbable hydrogel implant incorporating travoprost that is designed to be administered by a physician as an intracameral injection with an initial target duration of drug release of Table of Contents four to six months. Preclinical studies to date have demonstrated reduction of IOP and pharmacokinetics in the aqueous humor that suggest a pharmacodynamic response of IOP lowering in humans. We initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial outside the United States in third quarter of 2017 to assess safety and obtain initial efficacy data. The trial is a prospective, single-center study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, durability and tolerability of OTX-TIC compared to topical travoprost (eye drops) in up to 20 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. We submitted an investigational new drug application, or IND, in the first quarter of 2018 and expect to initiate a second Phase 1 trial in the United States in the first half of 2018. Back-of-the-Eye Programs We are engaged in the preclinical development of formulations of our hydrogel administered via intravitreal injection to address the large and growing markets for diseases and conditions of the back of the eye. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our extended-delivery hydrogel in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule drugs, such as TKIs, for the treatment of retinal diseases such as wet AMD, retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema. Our initial goal for these programs is to provide extended delivery of a protein-based large molecule or small molecule TKI drug targeting VEGF over a four to six month period of a protein-based large molecule or small molecule TKI drug, thereby reducing the frequency of the current monthly or bi-monthly intravitreal injection regimen for wet AMD and other retinal diseases and providing a more consistent uniform release of drug over the treatment period. OTX-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor implant) OTX-TKI (tyrosine kinase inhibitor implant) is a preformed, bioresorbable hydrogel fiber incorporating a small molecule TKI with anti-angiogenic properties delivered by intravitreal injection. TKIs have shown promise in the treatment of wet AMD. In May 2017, we reported data from preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of OTX-TKI. In this study, OTX-TKI was well-tolerated, and high levels of drug were maintained in the tissue for up to twelve months in Dutch belted rabbits. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial outside the United States in the first half of 2018 to assess the safety, durability and tolerability of OTX-TKI in the posterior segment of the human eye for the treatment of VEGF induced retinal leakage for an extended duration. Regeneron Collaboration In October 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, or Collaboration Agreement, with Regeneron for the development and potential commercialization of products using our hydrogel in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds for the treatment of retinal diseases, with the initial focus on the VEGF trap aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. The Collaboration Agreement does not cover the development of any products that deliver small molecule drugs, including TKIs, for any target including VEGF, or any products that deliver large molecule drugs other than those that target VEGF proteins. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, we and Regeneron have agreed to conduct a joint research program with the aim of developing an extended-delivery formulation of aflibercept that is suitable for advancement into clinical development. A joint research committee comprised of an equal number of representatives from each of Regeneron and us is responsible for reviewing, approving and overseeing the parties' research and development activities with respect to licensed product candidates and making any modifications to those activities. In general, Regeneron has final decision-making authority over matters on which the joint research committee deadlocks, following escalation to designated executive officer representatives of the parties, except for matters that would impose a material increase in costs or obligations on us beyond those costs and obligations included in the mutually agreed collaboration plan. We granted Regeneron an option, or the Option, to enter into an exclusive, worldwide license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize products using our hydrogel in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, or Licensed Products. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron is responsible for funding an initial preclinical tolerability study, which it initiated in early 2018. If the Option is exercised, Regeneron will conduct further preclinical development and an initial clinical trial under a collaboration plan. We are obligated to reimburse Regeneron for certain development costs during the period through the completion of the initial clinical trial, subject to a cap of $25 million, which cap may be increased by up to $5 million under certain circumstances. We do not expect our funding requirements under the collaboration to be material over the next twelve months. If Regeneron elects to proceed with further development beyond the initial clinical trial, it will be solely responsible for conducting and funding further Table of Contents development and commercialization of product candidates. If the Option is exercised, Regeneron is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop and commercialize at least one Licensed Product. Such efforts shall include initiating the dosing phase of a subsequent clinical trial within specified time periods following the completion of the first-in-human clinical trial or the initiation of preclinical toxicology studies, subject to certain extensions. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron has agreed to pay us $10 million upon exercise of the Option. We are also eligible to receive up to $145 million per Licensed Product upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, including successful results from the first-in-human clinical trial, $100 million per Licensed Product upon first commercial sale of such Licensed Product and up to $50 million based on the achievement of specified sales milestones for all Licensed Products. In addition, we are entitled to tiered, escalating royalties, in a range from a high-single digit to a low-to-mid teen percentage of net sales of Licensed Products. ReSure Following our receipt of FDA approval for ReSure Sealant, we commercially launched this product in the United States in 2014. ReSure Sealant is approved to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery and is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use. In the pivotal clinical trials that formed the basis for FDA approval, ReSure Sealant provided superior wound closure and a better safety profile than sutured closure. While ReSure Sealant remains commercially available in the United States, there is no sales support provided to the product at this time. Additional Potential Areas for Growth In addition to our focus on formulating, developing and commercializing innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, we are also assessing the potential use of our hydrogel platform technology in new areas of the body. If we are to utilize our intellectual property, all of which we currently license from Incept, LLC, or Incept, for applications outside the field of ophthalmology, we will need to negotiate and enter into an amendment to our existing license agreement with Incept or a new license agreement with Incept covering one or more additional such fields of use. Financial Position We have generated limited revenue to date. In the first quarter of 2014, we began recognizing revenue from sales of ReSure Sealant. All of our sustained drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability. Instead, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and OTX-TP. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net losses were $63.4 million, $44.7 million and $39.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As of December 31, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $237.3 million. Our total cost and operating expenses were $63.8 million, $45.2 million and $39.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively, including $7.3 million, $6.0 million and $4.6 million, respectively, in non-cash stock-based compensation expense. Our operating expenses have grown as we continue to pursue the clinical development of our most advanced product candidates, DEXTENZA and OTX-TP; continue the research and development of our other product candidates; continue the internal development of our intravitreal hydrogel-based formulation for the sustained delivery of protein-based or small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs, such as anti-VEGF drugs and TKIs for the treatment of wet AMD and other back-of-the-eye diseases; and seek marketing approval for any such product candidate for which we obtain favorable pivotal clinical trial results. In August 2017, we updated our DEXTENZA commercial plans and expect to realize savings in operating expenses, including reduced personnel costs, as a result of streamlining headcount, as part of an initiative to enhance operations and reduce expenses. As a result, we expect to incur lower sales and marketing expenses for our product candidates until we obtain marketing approval of DEXTENZA or any of our other product candidates. In addition, we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We do not expect to generate significant revenue from sales of any product for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we may need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to Table of Contents access our borrowing capacity or raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. In July 2014, we completed an initial public offering, or IPO, of our common stock, and in August 2014 the underwriters in our IPO exercised their over-allotment option in full. We received total net proceeds of approximately $66.4 million from the issuance and sale of 5,750,000 shares of common stock, including in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their over-allotment option, after deducting underwriting discounts and offering costs. In June 2015, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $22.00 per share. The offering consisted of 4,600,000 shares of common stock, of which 3,200,000 shares were issued and sold by us and 1,400,000 shares were sold by certain of our stockholders, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $65.6 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses. In November 2016, we entered into an At-the-Market Sales Agreement, or the 2016 ATM Agreement with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $40.0 million from time to time. Through January 31, 2018, we have sold an aggregate of 890,568 shares of common stock under the 2016 ATM Agreement resulting in net proceeds of approximately $6.6 million after underwriting discounts, commission and other offering expenses. In January 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share. The offering consisted of 3,571,429 shares of common stock sold by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $23.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and expenses. In January 2018, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $5.00 per share. The offering consisted of 7,475,000 shares of common stock sold by us, including those shares sold in connection with the exercise by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional shares. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $35.1 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. Based on our current plans and forecasted expenses, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, as of December 31, 2017, along with the proceeds from our public offering of common stock in January 2018 but without giving effect to any potential payment under our Collaboration Agreement with Regeneron, will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements through the first quarter of 2019. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We have not reflected the full costs of building a sales force that we would build if DEXTENZA is approved for marketing in our current operating plan and will need to raise additional capital to support such an effort. See ""-Liquidity and Capital Resources."" Financial Operations Overview Revenue From our inception through December 31, 2017, we have generated limited amounts of revenue from the sales of our products. Our ReSure Sealant product received premarket approval, or PMA, from the FDA in January 2014. We commenced sales of ReSure Sealant in the first quarter of 2014, have received only limited revenues from ReSure Sealant to date and anticipate only limited sales for 2018. ReSure Sealant is currently our only source of revenue from product sales. We may generate revenue in the future if we successfully develop one or more of our product candidates and receive marketing approval for any such product candidate or if we enter into longer-term collaboration agreements with third parties. We entered into a feasibility agreement with a biotechnology company relating to our intravitreal drug delivery injection in October 2014. Under this agreement, the biotechnology company had agreed to pay us up to $0.7 million, of which $0.3 million was a non-refundable up-front payment due upon contract execution and $0.4 million will be due upon the achievement of certain milestones. Initially, we were recognizing the non-refundable, non-contingent up-front payment of $0.3 million as revenue on a straight-line basis over the twelve-month period in which we are expected to complete our performance obligations. Estimates of this development period involves the evaluation of many assumptions and uncertainties and may change if facts and circumstances change. During 2015, management reevaluated and revised the estimated development period to extend through March 2016. If and when a contingent milestone payment is earned, the additional consideration to be received will be added to the total expected payments under the contract and recognized as revenue based on the proportional performance methodology. In January 2015, we achieved Table of Contents the first milestone under the feasibility agreement triggering a payment due of $0.3 million. This agreement was terminated in the second quarter of 2016 and the Company does not have any further obligations. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include: � employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and payroll taxes, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development, clinical and regulatory and other related functions; � expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, including with the investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs; � expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to the FDA for our submissions for product approvals; � expenses associated with developing our pre-commercial manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing clinical study materials; � ongoing research and development activities relating to our core bioresorbable hydrogel technology and improvements to this technology; � facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; � costs relating to the supply and manufacturing of product inventory, prior to approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products; and � expenses associated with preclinical development activities. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external . . . Mar 08, 2018 (c) 1995-2018 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

OCUL,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q and our Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 10, 2017. Some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business, includes forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. As a result of many factors, including those factors set forth in the ""Risk Factors"" section of this Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, our actual results could differ materially from the results described in, or implied by, the forward-looking statements contained in the following discussion and analysis. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye using our proprietary hydrogel platform technology. Our bioresorbable hydrogel-based drug product candidates are designed to provide extended delivery of therapeutic agents to the eye. Our lead product candidates are DEXTENZA (dexamethasone insert), for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain, allergic conjunctivitis and dry eye disease, and OTX-TP, for the treatment of glaucoma and ocular hypertension, which are extended-delivery, drug-eluting inserts that are placed into the canaliculus through a natural opening called the punctum located in the inner portion of the eyelid near the nose. Our intracanalicular inserts combine our hydrogel technology with U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approved therapeutic agents with the goal of providing extended delivery of drug to the eye. We also have a preclinical product development candidate that is injected into the front of the eye intracamerally for the treatment of glaucoma. We also have an intravitreal hydrogel depot which is in preclinical development for the treatment of diseases and conditions of the back of the eye including wet age-related macular degeneration, or wet AMD. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs, or small molecule drugs, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, or TKIs. Our intravitreal depot is designed to be delivered via intravitreal injection to release therapeutic agents, such as antibodies to vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF, over a sustained period. We have entered into a collaboration with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Regeneron, for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, with the initial focus on the VEGF trap aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. In addition to our ongoing product development, we currently market our first commercial product, ReSure Sealant, a hydrogel-based ophthalmic wound sealant approved by the FDA to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery. ReSure Sealant is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use. DEXTENZA Our most advanced product candidate, DEXTENZA, incorporates the FDA-approved corticosteroid dexamethasone as an active pharmaceutical ingredient into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting insert for intracanalicular use. In September 2015, we submitted to the FDA a New Drug Application, or NDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. In July 2016, we received a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, from the FDA regarding our NDA for DEXTENZA. This CRL pertained to deficiencies in manufacturing process and controls identified during a pre-NDA approval inspection of our manufacturing facility. In January 2017, we resubmitted our NDA. Following a re-inspection of manufacturing operations by the FDA which was completed in May 2017, we received an FDA Form 483 containing inspectional observations focused on procedures for manufacturing processes and analytical testing related to the manufacture of drug product for commercial production. In July 2017, we received a CRL from the FDA regarding our NDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. This 2017 CRL refers to deficiencies in manufacturing processes and analytical testing related to manufacturing of drug product identified during the pre-NDA approval inspection and states that the FDA has determined that it cannot approve the NDA in its present form. We have corresponded with the FDA regarding these inspectional observations and are working to resolve the issues that have been identified, including the presence of particulate matter in certain manufactured lots of DEXTENZA. Following up on our initial response to the Form 483 in May 2017, we continue to provide the FDA with updates on our corrective actions in an effort to close out the Form 483 deficiencies. Subject to the closing out of the Form 483, including process qualification which we believe will require consistently producing commercial lots, we plan to resubmit our NDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. Adequate resolution of the outstanding Form 483 inspectional observations with the FDA New England District Office is a prerequisite to the approval of the NDA for Table of Contents DEXTENZA, although the final decision as to the adequacy of our manufacturing processes is made by the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, or CDER, with input from CDER's Office of Process and Facilities, as part of the NDA review process. We have completed three Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain. The data from two of these three completed Phase 3 clinical trials and a prior Phase 2 clinical trial are being used to support our NDA for post-surgical ocular pain. Subject to receiving approval for the pain indication pursuant to our NDA, we plan to submit an NDA supplement, or sNDA, for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation. We have also completed two Phase 3 clinical trials of DEXTENZA for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. In October 2015, we announced topline results of our first Phase 3 clinical trial for allergic conjunctivitis, and in June 2016 we announced topline results of our second Phase 3 clinical trial for this indication. Finally, DEXTENZA is in Phase 2 clinical development for the treatment of dry eye disease. We announced topline results from Phase 2 clinical trial for this indication in December 2015. We are assessing our plans for our dry eye program going forward and may focus future efforts on an intracanalicular insert containing an immunosuppressant drug. OTX-TP Our second product candidate, OTX-TP, incorporates travoprost, an FDA-approved prostaglandin analog that reduces elevated intraocular pressure, or IOP, as its active pharmaceutical ingredient, into a hydrogel-based drug-eluting intracanalicular insert. OTX-TP is being developed as a treatment for glaucoma and ocular hypertension. We reported topline results from a Phase 2b clinical trial for this indication in October 2015. We completed an End-of-Phase 2 review with the FDA in April 2016 and initiated the first of two Phase 3 clinical trials of OTX-TP in September 2016. We expect topline efficacy data from the first Phase 3 clinical trial in the second half of 2018. We plan to initiate the second Phase 3 clinical trial in 2017. Intracameral Glaucoma (OTX-TIC) Product Candidate We are conducting preclinical development of OTX-TIC, our product candidate, for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe glaucoma and ocular hypertension. OTX-TIC (extended-delivery travoprost) is a bioresorbable hydrogel insert incorporating travoprost that is designed to be an intracameral injection into the anterior chamber of the eye with an initial target duration of drug release of three to four months. Preclinical studies to date have demonstrated clinically meaningful intraocular pressure lowering and good pharmacokinetics in the aqueous humor. We expect to initiate a pilot clinical study outside the United States in 2017 to assess safety and obtain initial efficacy data. The study is expected to be a prospective, single-center, randomized, double-masked, sham-controlled study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of OTX-TIC compared to topical travoprost (eye drops) in up to 20 patients with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. If the results from this trial are promising, we plan to advance to a Phase 2 clinical development program in the United States. Back-of-the-Eye Programs In addition to DEXTENZA and OTX-TP, we are engaged in the preclinical development of our hydrogel depot administered via intravitreal injection to address the large and growing markets for diseases and conditions of the back of the eye. Our initial development efforts are focused on the use of our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with anti-angiogenic drugs, such as protein-based anti-VEGF drugs or small molecule drugs, such as TKIs, for the treatment of retinal diseases such as wet AMD, retinal vein occlusion and diabetic macular edema. Our initial goal for these programs is to provide extended delivery of a protein-based large molecule or small molecule TKI drug targeting VEGF and other targets over a four to six month period following administration of a bioresorbable hydrogel incorporating the drug by an injection into the vitreous humor, thereby reducing the frequency of the current monthly or bi-monthly intravitreal injection regimen for wet AMD and other retinal diseases and potentially providing a more consistent uniform release of drug over the treatment period. OTX-TKI OTX-TKI is a preformed, bioresorbable hydrogel fiber depot with anti-angiogenic properties delivered by intravitreal tyrosine kinase inhibitor injection. TKIs have shown promise in the treatment of wet AMD. Currently OTX- Table of Contents TKI is under initial preclinical investigation as a novel extended release drug product candidate. In May 2017, we reported data from preclinical studies evaluating the efficacy, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of our OTX-TKI depot. In this study, the OTX-TKI depot was well-tolerated, and high tissue levels of TKI were maintained for up to 6 months in Dutch belted rabbits. We plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial to assess whether our OTX-TKI depot might deliver TKI to the posterior segment of the human eye for the treatment of VEGF induced retinal leakage for an extended duration later in 2017. Regeneron Collaboration In October 2016, we entered into a strategic collaboration, option and license agreement, or the Collaboration Agreement, with Regeneron for the development and potential commercialization of products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds for the treatment of retinal diseases, with the initial focus on the VEGF trap aflibercept, currently marketed under the brand name Eylea. The Collaboration Agreement does not cover the development of any products that deliver small molecule drugs, including TKIs, for any target including VEGF, or any products that deliver large molecule drugs other than those that target VEGF proteins. We granted Regeneron an option, or the Option, to enter into an exclusive, worldwide license under our intellectual property to develop and commercialize products containing our extended-delivery hydrogel depot in combination with Regeneron's large molecule VEGF-targeting compounds, or Licensed Products. If the Option is exercised, Regeneron will conduct further preclinical development and an initial clinical trial under a collaboration plan. We are obligated to reimburse Regeneron for certain development costs during the period through the completion of the initial clinical trial, subject to a cap of $25 million, which cap may be increased by up to $5 million under certain circumstances. Regeneron will be responsible for funding an initial preclinical tolerability study. We do not expect our funding requirements to be material over the next twelve months. If Regeneron elects to proceed with further development beyond the initial clinical trial, it will be solely responsible for conducting and funding further development and commercialization of product candidates. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Regeneron has agreed to pay us $10 million upon exercise of the Option. We are also eligible to receive up to $145 million per Licensed Product upon the achievement of specified development and regulatory milestones, including successful results from the first-in-human clinical trial, $100 million per Licensed Product upon first commercial sale of such Licensed Product and up to $50 million based on the achievement of specified sales milestones for all Licensed Products. In addition, we are entitled to tiered, escalating royalties, in a range from a high-single digit to a low-to-mid teen percentage of net sales of Licensed Products. ReSure Following our receipt of FDA approval for ReSure Sealant, we commercially launched this product in the United States in 2014, initially through a network of ophthalmology-focused distributors. In early 2017, we terminated these distributors and hired a contract sales force of four representatives to sell ReSure Sealant. ReSure Sealant is approved to seal corneal incisions following cataract surgery and is the first and only surgical sealant to be approved by the FDA for ophthalmic use. In the pivotal clinical trials that formed the basis for FDA approval, ReSure Sealant provided superior wound closure and a better safety profile than sutured closure. Additional Potential Areas for Growth In addition to our focus on developing and commercializing innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, we are also assessing the future growth potential of the hydrogel platform technology in new areas of the body. In order to properly evaluate and then execute upon any applications beyond the field of ophthalmology, we would need to negotiate and enter into an amendment to our existing license agreement with Incept, LLC, or Incept, or a new license agreement with Incept covering one or more additional such fields of use. Financial Position We have generated limited revenue to date. All of our extended-delivery drug delivery products are in various phases of clinical and preclinical development. We do not expect sales of ReSure Sealant to generate revenue that is sufficient for us to achieve profitability. Instead, our ability to generate product revenue sufficient to achieve profitability will depend heavily on our obtaining marketing approval for and commercializing products with greater Table of Contents market potential, including one or both of DEXTENZA and OTX-TP. Since inception, we have incurred significant operating losses. Our net loss was $18.7 million and $34.7 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively. As of June 30, 2017, we had an accumulated deficit of $208.6 million. Our total cost and operating expenses were $18.8 million and $34.9 million for the three and six months ended June 30, 2017, respectively, including $2.1 million and $4.1 million in non-cash stock-based compensation expense and depreciation expense, respectively. Our operating expenses have grown as we continue to pursue the clinical development of our most advanced product candidates, DEXTENZA and OTX-TP; continue the research and development of our other product candidates; continue the internal development of our intravitreal hydrogel depot for the sustained delivery of protein-based or small molecule anti-angiogenic drugs, such as anti-VEGF drugs and TKIs for the treatment of wet AMD and other back-of-the-eye diseases; and seek marketing approval for any such product candidate for which we obtain favorable pivotal clinical trial results. In August 2017, we updated our DEXTENZA commercial plans and expect to realize savings in operating expenses, including personal costs, as a result of streamlining headcount, as part of an initiative to enhance operations and reduce expenses. As a result, we expect to incur lower sales and marketing expenses for our product candidates until we obtain marketing approval of DEXTENZA or any of our other product candidates. In addition, we will continue to incur additional costs associated with operating as a public company. We do not generate significant revenue from product sales and may not for several years, if at all. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to access our borrowing capacity or raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our research and development programs or any future commercialization efforts or to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product candidates or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. In November 2016, we entered into an At-the-Market Sales Agreement, or the 2016 ATM Agreement, with Cantor Fitzgerald & Co., or Cantor, under which we may offer and sell our common stock having aggregate proceeds of up to $40.0 million from time to time. As of June 30, 2017, we have sold an aggregate of 534,216 shares of common stock under the 2016 ATM Agreement, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $4.4 million after underwriting discounts, commission and other offering expenses. In January 2017, we completed a follow-on offering of our common stock at a public offering price of $7.00 per share. The offering consisted of 3,571,429 shares of common stock sold by us. We received net proceeds from the follow-on offering of approximately $23.3 million after deducting underwriting discounts and expenses. Based on our current plans and forecasted expenses, we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities will enable us to fund our operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditure requirements through the third quarter of 2018. See ""-Liquidity and Capital Resources."" Financial Operations Overview Revenue From our inception through June 30, 2017, we have generated limited amounts of revenue from the sales of our products. Our ReSure Sealant product received premarket approval, or PMA, from the FDA in 2014. We commenced sales of ReSure Sealant in 2014, have received only limited revenues from ReSure Sealant to date and anticipate only limited sales for 2017. ReSure Sealant is currently our only source of revenue from product sales. We may generate revenue in the future if we successfully develop one or more of our product candidates and receive marketing approval for any such product candidate or if we enter into longer-term collaboration agreements with third parties. Operating Expenses Research and Development Expenses Research and development expenses consist primarily of costs incurred for the development of our product candidates, which include: � employee-related expenses, including salaries, related benefits and payroll taxes, travel and stock-based compensation expense for employees engaged in research and development, clinical and regulatory and other related functions; Table of Contents � expenses incurred in connection with the clinical trials of our product candidates, including with the investigative sites that conduct our clinical trials and under agreements with contract research organizations, or CROs; � expenses relating to regulatory activities, including filing fees paid to the FDA for our submissions for product approvals; � expenses associated with developing our pre-commercial manufacturing capabilities and manufacturing clinical study materials; � ongoing research and development activities relating to our core bioresorbable hydrogel technology and improvements to this technology; � facilities, depreciation and other expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities, insurance and supplies; � costs relating to the supply and manufacturing of product inventory, prior to approval by the FDA or other regulatory agencies of our products; and � expenses associated with preclinical development activities. We expense research and development costs as incurred. We recognize external development costs based on an evaluation of the progress to completion of specific tasks using information provided to us by our vendors and our clinical investigative sites. Our direct research and development expenses are tracked on a program-by-program basis and consist primarily of external costs, such as fees paid to investigators, consultants, central laboratories and CROs in connection with our clinical trials and regulatory fees. We do not allocate employee and contractor-related costs, costs associated with our platform technology, costs related to manufacturing or purchasing clinical trial materials, and facility expenses, including depreciation or other indirect costs, to specific product development programs because these costs are deployed across multiple product development programs and, as such, are not separately classified. We use internal resources in combination with third-party CROs, including clinical monitors and clinical research associates, to manage our clinical trials, monitor patient enrollment and perform data analysis for many of our clinical trials. These employees work across multiple development programs and, therefore, we do not track their costs by program. The table below summarizes our research and development expenses incurred by product development program:  Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, 2017 2016 2017 2016 ReSure Sealant $ 45 $ 94 $ 65 $ 171 DEXTENZA for post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain 516 842 871 1,693 DEXTENZA for allergic conjunctivitis 140 1,323 286 2,801 DEXTENZA for dry eye disease - 43 6 84 OTX-TP for glaucoma and ocular hypertension 1,471 263 2,498 580 Unallocated expenses 5,945 4,413 11,120 8,722 Total research and development expenses $ 8,117 $ 6,978 $ 14,846 $ 14,051  We expect that our expenses will increase in connection with our ongoing activities including costs related to clinical trials and other research and development activities for our DEXTENZA and OTX-TP product candidates and other research and development activities. Table of Contents The successful development and commercialization of our product candidates is highly uncertain. This is due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development and commercialization, including the uncertainty of: � the scope, progress, outcome and costs of our clinical trials and other research and development activities; � the timing, receipt and terms of any marketing approvals; � the efficacy and potential advantages of our product candidates compared to alternative treatments, including any standard of care; � the market acceptance of our product candidates; and � significant and changing government regulation. Any changes in the outcome of any of these variables with respect to the development of our product candidates in clinical and preclinical development could mean a significant change in the costs and timing associated with the development of these product candidates. For example, if the FDA or another regulatory authority were to require us to conduct clinical trials or other testing beyond those that we currently expect or if we experience significant delays in enrollment in any of our clinical trials, we could be required to expend significant additional financial resources and time on the completion of clinical development of that product candidate. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs, including stock-based compensation, for personnel in executive, finance and administrative functions. General and administrative expenses also include facility-related costs and professional fees for legal, patent, consulting and accounting and audit services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses will increase in the future as we increase our headcount to support our continued development and commercialization of our product candidates. We also anticipate that we will continue to incur increased accounting, audit, legal, regulatory, compliance, director and officer insurance costs as well as investor and public relations expenses associated with being a public company. Selling and Marketing Expenses Selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs for personnel in selling and marketing functions as well as consulting and advertising and promotion costs. During the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, we incurred selling and marketing expenses in connection with ReSure Sealant, which we began commercializing in 2014, and marketing expenses in preparation for a potential commercial launch of our product candidates. In August 2017, we reorganized our DEXTENZA commercial plans and expect to realize savings in operating expenses, including personal costs, as a result of streamlining headcount, as part of an initiative to enhance operations and reduce expenses. As a result, we expect our selling and marketing expenses to decrease until we obtain marketing approval of our product candidates. Other Income (Expense) Interest Income. Interest income consists primarily of interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities. In the three and six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, our interest income has not been significant due to the low rates of interest being earned on our invested balances. Interest Expense. Interest expense is incurred on our debt. In December 2015, we amended our credit facility to increase the aggregate principal amount to $15.6 million, extend the interest-only payment period through December 2016, and extend the maturity date to December 1, 2019. In March 2017, we amended our credit facility to increase the Table of Contents aggregate principal amount to $18.0 million, extend the interest-only payment period through February 2018, and extend the maturity date to December 1, 2020.

OCUL,"Ocular Therapeutix™, Inc. OCUL, -0.31% a biopharmaceutical company focused on the formulation, development, and commercialization of innovative therapies for diseases and conditions of the eye, today announced financial results for the fourth quarter and the twelve months ended December 31, 2017 and provided a business update. “It gives me great pleasure to turn the page on 2017 and look forward to 2018 with a rebuilt team in place and an exciting set of near-term opportunities before us,” said Antony Mattessich, President and Chief Executive Officer. “We have gained significant momentum in making the changes we believe are necessary to resubmit our New Drug Application for DEXTENZA and advance our pipeline. Based on this momentum, we can reaffirm our guidance that we are on track for a resubmission of our DEXTENZA NDA in the first half of 2018.” Key Highlights and Upcoming Events DEXTENZA™ New Drug Application (NDA) resubmission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) remains on track for the first half of 2018. DEXTENZA is a long-acting form of dexamethasone that uses Ocular Therapeutix’s proprietary hydrogel technology to treat post-surgical ocular pain and inflammation. In November, the Company completed its formal response to the May 2017 FDA Form 483 in which the Company addressed the FDA’s observations concerning the manufacturing processes of and analytical testing related to DEXTENZA. In December the Company requested a meeting with the FDA to describe its remediation efforts and resubmission plans and seek feedback. A meeting was granted in January and preliminary written responses from the FDA to the Company’s questions fully addressed its meeting objectives. The Company determined that the meeting would no longer be necessary because of the completeness of the FDA’s response and that the FDA’s comments have not required any substantial change in its manufacturing or regulatory plans. Subject to satisfactorily addressing the FDA inspectional observations and demonstrating consistency in its commercial stage manufacturing process, the Company plans to resubmit its NDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical pain in the first half of 2018 and would then expect a decision from the FDA by the end of 2018. Topline efficacy data from the Phase 3 Trial of OTX-TP (travoprost insert) for mild to moderate glaucoma expected in second half 2018. In 2016, the Company began enrollment of its first Phase 3 clinical trial, a 550-patient prospective, multi-center, randomized, parallel-arm, double masked, vehicle-controlled trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of OTX-TP in the treatment of subjects with open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The primary efficacy endpoint is the statistically superior reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) from baseline with OTX-TP compared to placebo inserts at 2, 6 and 12 weeks following insertion. These include statistically superior IOP reduction at three diurnal time points of 8:00 AM, 10:00 AM, and 4:00 PM, at each of these weeks. In addition, while not a primary endpoint, the IOP reduction will also need to be clinically meaningful for regulatory approval. The Company expects to have topline efficacy results in the fourth quarter of 2018. Submitted U.S. Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for OTX-TIC (travoprost implant) and plans to initiate the U.S. Phase 1 clinical trial in the first half 2018. OTX-TIC is Ocular Therapeutix’s second glaucoma program and it targets a more severe patient population. The Company is developing OTX-TIC as its bioresorbable travoprost-containing hydrogel implant delivered via an intracameral injection. OTX-TIC targets patients with moderate to severe glaucoma who need a higher level of intraocular pressure reduction. The Company has initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial with OTX-TIC outside the United States. This trial is a prospective, single-center study designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of OTX-TIC compared to travoprost eye drops in patients with primary open-angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension. The Company also submitted a U.S. IND in the first quarter of 2018 enabling it to conduct a multi-center, open label, clinical trial evaluating the safety, efficacy, durability, and tolerability of OTX-TIC in patients in the same indication. Based on the results from these trials, the Company plans to advance OTX-TIC into a full development program. Expect to initiate ex-U.S. Phase 1 clinical trial for OTX-TKI (Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor Implant) in the first half of 2018. OTX-TKI is a bioresorbable, hydrogel fiber implant with anti-angiogenic properties, delivered by intravitreal injection. Preclinical data have demonstrated the ability to deliver an efficacious dose of TKI to the posterior segment of the eye for the treatment of VEGF-induced retinal leakage for an extended duration of up to twelve months. The Company is currently planning for a Phase 1 clinical trial to begin outside the U.S. in the first half of 2018. The trial will be a multi-center, open label, dose escalation study to test the safety, durability, and tolerability of OTX-TKI. The Company also plans to evaluate biological activity by following visual acuity over time and measuring retinal thickness using standard optical coherence tomography (OCT). Continuing progress with Regeneron for the development of a sustained release formulation of VEGF trap aflibercept. Regeneron initiated a non-human primate trial of an extended release hydrogel-based formulation of its protein-based anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) trap, aflibercept, for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) in early 2018. The Company remains encouraged about the engagement of both teams and the multiple possibilities this partnership could lead to. Completed the transition of the management team. Ocular Therapeutix expanded its leadership team with the additions of Naymisha Patel, Vice President of Quality and Kevin Hanley, Senior Vice President, Technical Operations. Naymisha brings over 20 years of experience working with blue-chip biotechnology companies and she has a proven record in quality management, process improvement, regulatory submissions and regulatory compliance. Kevin joins the Company from Pfizer and brings to the Company over 30 years of experience managing biopharmaceutical technical operations, with demonstrated success in technology transfer and process scale-up for the manufacturing of proteins from development through manufacturing approval. These appointments to the management team represent critical additions to ensure the Company’s core DEXTENZA manufacturing capabilities meet cGMP standards and that the Company can supply the anticipated commercial needs of DEXTENZA ahead of a potential FDA approval. Since July 2017 Ocular Therapeutix has appointed new team members to six of the top nine management positions in the Company, bringing in over 100 years of biopharmaceutical experience. Fourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Financial Results In January 2018, Ocular Therapeutix completed a follow-on public offering raising net proceeds of $35.1 million that consisted of 7,475,000 shares of common stock, including those shares exercised by the underwriter of its option to purchase additional shares, pursuant to a shelf registration statement that was previously filed with and declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As of December 31, 2017, cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $41.5 million. Cash used in operating activities was $10.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2017 and $50.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2017. There was $18.0 million in outstanding debt as of December 31, 2017 with an interest-only payment period through February 1, 2018. Ocular Therapeutix reported a net loss of approximately $(13.1) million, or $(0.44) per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $(12.8) million, or $(0.52) per share, for the quarter ended December 31, 2016. The fourth quarter 2017 results include $2.6 million in non-cash charges for stock-based compensation and depreciation compared to $2.0 million in such non-cash charges in the fourth quarter of 2016. The Company reported a net loss of approximately $(63.4) million, or $(2.20) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to a net loss of $(44.7) million, or $(1.80) per share, for the year ended December 31, 2016. The 2017 results include $8.9 million in non-cash charges for stock-based compensation and depreciation compared to $6.8 million in such non-cash charges in 2016. Total costs and operating expenses for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 were $13.2 million and $63.8 million, respectively, as compared to $12.9 million and $45.2 million for the comparable periods in 2016. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the three and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 were $7.9 million and $30.9 million, respectively, compared to $7.3 million and $27.1 million for the comparable periods in 2016. The Company continues to advance the clinical and preclinical development of its hydrogel platform technology and its portfolio of drug product candidates. Ocular Therapeutix generated $0.5 million and $1.9 million in revenue during the three month and twelve month periods ended December 31, 2017 from product sales of ReSure [®]  Sealant and from collaborations with corporate partners. As of December 31, 2017, there were approximately 29.7 million shares issued and outstanding. Based on the proceeds from the January offering plus existing cash on-hand, the Company believes that it has adequate cash to fund its operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditures requirements through the first quarter of 2019. This forecast does not include a potential $10 million option payment under the Regeneron collaboration that would be due if Regeneron determines to advance the program into human clinical trials.

We believe the completion of this work is essential for the timely resubmission of the DEXTENZA™ New Drug Application, as well as for the advancement of our other pipeline products,” said Antony Mattessich, President and Chief Executive Officer. “During the quarter, we also continued to strengthen our senior leadership team with the appointments of Dr. Mike Goldstein as Chief Medical Officer and Donald Notman as Chief Financial Officer. As we advance our portfolio of hydrogel-based drug product candidates towards key inflection points, we also continue to explore additional opportunities to maximize the value of our proprietary hydrogel-based formulation technology and further enable our transition into a fully-integrated biopharmaceutical company.” Recent Updates and Anticipated Near-Term Milestones DEXTENZA™ (dexamethasone insert) for the treatment of post-surgical ocular inflammation and pain Following a January 2017 New Drug Application (NDA) resubmission to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and a re-inspection of manufacturing operations by the FDA which was completed in May of 2017, the Company received an FDA Form-483 containing inspectional observations concerning manufacturing processes and analytical testing related to the manufacturing of DEXTENZA drug product that led to a Complete Response Letter (CRL) from the FDA in July 2017. Following the Company’s initial response to the Form FDA-483 submitted to the FDA in May 2017, Ocular Therapeutix submitted its responses to the FDA’s remaining inspectional observations in November 2017. The Company intends to meet with the FDA in early 2018 to review plans to resubmit its NDA for DEXTENZA for the treatment of post-surgical ocular pain. Subject to addressing the FDA inspectional observations and demonstrating consistency in future manufacturing runs, the Company plans to resubmit its NDA for DEXTENZA in the first half of 2018. OTX-TP (travoprost insert) and OTX-TIC (travoprost intracameral injection) for the reduction of intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension Ocular Therapeutix continues to enroll patients in its first Phase 3 clinical trial for OTX-TP (travoprost insert) for the reduction of IOP in patients with glaucoma and ocular hypertension. The Company expects topline efficacy data from the completed trial in the second half of 2018. Subject to allocation of available funding, the Company plans to initiate its second Phase 3 trial in 2018. Ocular Therapeutix is also developing an intracameral product candidate, OTX-TIC, which is a bioresorbable extended release travoprost implant delivered via a fine-gauge needle injection. The Company is developing OTX-TIC to potentially address the need for a higher level of IOP reduction for patients who have moderate to severe glaucoma. In the third quarter of 2017, the Company initiated a pilot human clinical trial outside the United States to assess safety and obtain initial efficacy data. The Company also expects to file an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in the first quarter of 2018 and initiate a second Phase 1 trial in the United States in the first half of 2018. Sustained release intravitreal depots for the treatment of serious retinal diseases Ocular Therapeutix is engaged in the preclinical development of its extended release intravitreal tyrosine kinase inhibitor injection (OTX-TKI) using the Company’s proprietary bioresorbable hydrogel fiber technology. The Company expects to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial outside the United States for OTX-TKI in the first half of 2018. In partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Ocular Therapeutix also continues to advance the development of an extended release hydrogel-based formulation of Regeneron’s protein-based anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) trap, aflibercept, for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) and other serious retinal diseases. Corporate The Company strengthened its management team with the appointments of Michael Goldstein, M.D., MBA, as Chief Medical Officer, and Donald Notman, MBA, as Chief Financial Officer. Dr. Goldstein is a highly-accomplished ophthalmologist who also serves as Co-Director, Cornea and External Disease Service and Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology at the New England Eye Center and Tufts University School of Medicine. He has held several senior medical leadership positions with ophthalmology-focused pharmaceutical companies and published extensively in multiple ophthalmology scientific journals. Mr. Notman brings a notable track record of success to Ocular Therapeutix with over 20 years of financial operations and senior-level investment banking experience. Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results As of September 30, 2017, cash and cash equivalents totaled $51.2 million. Cash used in operating activities was $14.4 million in the third quarter of 2017, compared to $7.3 million for the third quarter of 2016. The Company expects that cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund operating expenses, debt service obligations and capital expenditures into the fourth quarter of 2018. Ocular Therapeutix reported a net loss of approximately $(15.6) million, or $(0.54) per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2017, compared to a net loss of $(9.6) million, or $(0.39) per share, for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The third quarter 2017 results include $2.2 million in non-cash charges for stock-based compensation and depreciation compared to $1.6 million in such non-cash charges in the third quarter of 2016. The Company continues to advance the clinical and preclinical development of its hydrogel-based formulation technology and its portfolio of drug product candidates. Total costs and operating expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 were $15.7 million, as compared to $9.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in costs associated with the Company’s recent initiative to enhance operations and reduce expenses surrounding the delayed DEXTENZA launch as announced in August 2017, personnel expenses supporting the Company’s ongoing development programs, and facilities costs associated with the relocation of the Company’s corporate headquarters. Research and development expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 were $8.1 million, compared to $5.7 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2016. The increase was primarily due to an increase in personnel costs and facilities expenses associated with increased lab space at our corporate headquarters. Ocular Therapeutix generated $0.5 million in revenue during the three-month period ended September 30, 2017 from product sales of ReSure® Sealant. As of September 30, 2017, there were approximately 29.4 million shares issued and outstanding.
