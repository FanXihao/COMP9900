OAKS,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) — Interest in Facebook Inc. since its calamitous initial public offering has mirrored interest in the social-networking site: Investors and users are still hanging around, but they’re less enthusiastic. And just as users have cooled to the increasingly ad-laden experience of posting their favorite meals, musings and minutiae, investors have cooled to initial public offerings. Facebook’s FB, -1.88%  still stands as the biggest IPO of the young decade in terms of sheer spectacle. Nothing really comes close. Shutterstock Facebook’s stands as the biggest IPO of the young decade in terms of sheer spectacle — and nothing really comes close. Facebook’s experience, however, hasn’t exactly cast a pall on the IPO market. The bull market is fueling a stock-offering renaissance. IPO volume for the last four weeks is up 59% from the same period last year to $2.93 billion, according to Dealogic. But it’s the type of IPO that’s changed. Real-estate and property offerings are up nearly 40% from last year’s rates to more than $14 billion. Health-care offerings have climbed from just under $7 billion to nearly $10 billion. Technology stocks have surged, too. But their performance has been lackluster when compared with other industries. Tech IPOs in 2013 are up 39.2%, compared with a 58% gain for transportation and a 60% gain for forestry and paper. Even the downtrodden financial sector has produced 26.6% in IPO gains. When Is it OK to Text Your Doctor? The sample sizes may be small, but the rise in nontech IPOs and their relative performance underscore a bigger trend away from clicks and toward bricks. That is: Traditional industries — what we used to call old-economy companies — are finding favor with investors, particularly those burned by Facebook’s flameout. And no industry has beneftted from this shift more than real estate. In a sign of the changing tide, two home builders, Taylor Morrison Home Corp. and TRI Pointe homes Inc., filed for IPOs at the end of 2012 — the first home-builder IPOs since 2004. Companies such as Enova International, Nationstar Mortgage NSM, +0.11%  (a stock that’s up 150% during the last year), Homeloan Servicing Solutions and even Ally Financial ALFI, +1.77%  registered for follow-on offerings in the fourth quarter, according to Ernst & Young. Last week, Aviv REIT Inc. US:AVIV a sort of double play in that it finances long-term skilled-nursing facilities, priced an IPO that raised $264 million and gained 14% its first day in the market. Another real-estate offering, Five Oaks Investment Corp. OAKS, -0.34% which invests in residential-mortgage-backed securities, raised $61 million. Forget Facebook; IPO Investors Like Real Estate And more are on the way. American Residential Properties, a REIT specializing in single-family properties, just filed for an offering raising up to $300 million. But be warned: These are hardly sure winners. For instance, eight consecutive IPOs for REITs dealing in mortgages have seen their share prices fall on the first day of trading. And through last Friday, the performance of all IPOs has been 17% in total return, with just 4% of that aftermarket, according to Renaissance Capital. If all of this has a déjà vu feel, it’s not your mind playing tricks. A certain social-networking company seemed to be building toward an IPO climax that turned out to be, well, anticlimactic. In the same way, much of the money in housing and real-estate investments probably also has been made. Of course, investors could look at indirect plays such as banks and materials stocks, many of which are still relatively undervalued. The problem, of course, is that those Industries carry their own baggage. Materials companies don’t always prosper with a real-estate revival. Banks are still digging out from the legal morass left by the last housing boom. Ultimately, even considering its recent history, real estate does have one advantage over the alternatives. People tend to need homes, and many love them. A social network, on the other hand ... When it comes to investing, it might be better to go with something people need and love, rather than simply “like.” More from MarketWatch BlackRock fund manager sees this as the market’s ‘sweet spot’ Damn the torpedoes — what could take the S&P 500 to 3,000 Trump boasts about making up facts about trade deficit to Trudeau","Mar 26, 2013 6:15 p.m. ET",N/A,Forget Facebook; investors like real estate,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/forget-facebook-investors-like-real-estate-2013-03-26
OAKS,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections. Overview We are a Maryland corporation that, together with our subsidiaries, is focused on investing on a leveraged basis in mortgage-backed securities, or MBS, mortgage loans and other real estate-related assets. Our capital has primarily been invested in Agency RMBS, with a particular focus on shorter duration Agency securities backed by hybrid ARMs. Additionally, we have continued to maintain exposure to Multi-Family MBS, principally through owning subordinated and first-loss tranches in Freddie Mac K-series securitizations. We have sought to do so while reducing our reliance on short-term repurchase agreement financing, including through the use of re-securitization, or re-REMIC, financings. In January 2018 we entered into a series of transactions with subsidiaries of the Hunt Companies, Inc., a holding company that invests in businesses focused in the real estate and infrastructure markets, including investment management, mortgage banking, direct lending, loan servicing, asset management, property management, development, construction, consulting and advisory. We entered into a new management agreement with Hunt Investment Management, LLC, while another affiliate of Hunt purchased an ownership stake of approximately 9.5% through a combination of a privately-placed stock issuance and a purchase from our largest stockholder, XL Investments Ltd. The transactions are expected to provide us with a new strategic direction through the reallocation of capital into new investment opportunities in the commercial real estate space, and in particular direct access to Hunt's significant pipeline of specified transitional floating-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Hunt and its affiliates have extensive experience in the origination, servicing, risk management and financing of this asset class and the floating-rate nature of the loans should reduce or eliminate the need for complex interest-rate hedging. Subject to our ability to put in place term repurchase facilities and/or collateralized loan obligations of the type Hunt has historically used to finance this asset class, we intend to transition the portfolio towards loan assets that are positively correlated with rising interest rates and that have exhibited strong historical credit performance. Accordingly, in furtherance of our objective to provide attractive cash flow returns over time to our investors, our investment strategy is to invest in the following assets: Transitional multi-family and other commercial real estate loans, which are floating-rate loans secured by multi-family and other commercial real estate properties that are not guaranteed by a U.S. Government sponsored entity, or securitizations backed by such loans; Securitizations backed by multi-family mortgage loans, or Multi-Family MBS; Agency RMBS, which are residential mortgage-backed securities, for which a U.S. Government agency such as Ginnie Mae or a federally chartered corporation such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, guarantees payments of principal and interest on the securities; To a limited extent, Non-Agency RMBS, which are RMBS that are not issued or guaranteed by a U.S. Government-sponsored entity; and Other mortgage-related investments, including mortgage servicing rights, or MSRs, CMBS, or other loans or securities backed by real estate. We finance our current investments in Agency RMBS, Multi-Family MBS and Non-Agency RMBS primarily through short-term borrowings structured as repurchase agreements. We intend to finance our intended investments in transitional multi-family and other commercial real estate loans primarily through medium term borrowings structured either as repurchase agreements or secured loan facilities. Our primary sources of income are net interest income from our investment portfolio and non-interest income from our mortgage loan-related activities. Net interest income represents the interest income we earn on investments less the expenses of funding these investments. With effect from January 18, 2018, we are now externally managed and advised by Hunt Investment Management, LLC (""HIM""), pursuant to a management agreement between us and HIM, and the simultaneous termination of our previous management agreement with Oak Circle. As our Manager, HIM implements our business strategy, performs investment advisory services and activities with respect to our assets and is responsible for performing all of our day-to-day operations. HIM is an investment adviser registered with the SEC. Pursuant to the terms of the new management agreement, we are required to pay our Manager an annual base management fee of 1.50% of Stockholders' Equity (as defined in the management agreement, payable quarterly (0.375% per quarter) in arrears. Starting in the first full calendar quarter following January 18, 2019, we are also required to pay our Manager a quarterly incentive fee equal to 20% of the excess of Core Earnings (as defined in the management agreement) over a hurdle rate of 8% per annum. We are required to reimburse the Manager for costs associated with (i) an allocable share of the costs of non-investment personnel of the Manager and its affiliates who spend all or a portion of their time managing our affairs and operations, (ii) our CFO, (iii) our general counsel, in each case, based on a percentage of his time spent on the Company's affairs. Such reimbursement is subject to a cap of 1.5% of the average Stockholders' Equity (as defined in the management agreement) for the applicable fiscal year. We are also required to reimburse the Manager for other costs and expenses associated with our operations, including but not limited to, the costs and expenses associated with our formation and capital raising activities, rent, utilities, office furniture, equipment, machinery and other overhead type expenses, the costs of legal, accounting, auditing, tax planning and tax return preparation, consulting services and insurance. On January 18, 2018, we and Oak Circle, entered into a Termination Agreement (""Termination Agreement"") pursuant to which we and Oak Circle agreed to mutually and immediately terminate that certain management agreement, dated May 16, 2012, by and between us and Oak Circle. Under the terms of the Termination Agreement, the termination of the management agreement with Oak Circle did not trigger, and Oak Circle was not paid, a termination fee by us. Hunt separately agreed to pay Oak Circle a negotiated payment in connection with the foregoing. We have elected to be taxed as a REIT and comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code with respect thereto. Accordingly, we are generally not subject to federal income tax on our REIT taxable income that we currently distribute to our stockholders so long as we maintain our qualification as a REIT. Our continued qualification as a REIT depends on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code relating to, among other things, the source of our gross income, the composition and values of our assets, our distribution levels and the concentration of ownership of our capital stock. Even if we maintain our qualification as a REIT, we may become subject to some federal, state and local taxes on our income generated in our wholly owned taxable REIT subsidiary, Five Oaks Acquisition Corp., or FOAC. 2017 Highlights We reported an economic loss on common equity of 8.2%, comprised of a $1.09 decrease in net book value per share that more than offset a $0.60 dividend per common share. We continued the reduction of our credit risk MBS exposure during 2017. We reduced our Non-Agency exposure from $12.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $4.4 million at December 31, 2017 (on a non-GAAP, combined basis), and reduced our Multi-Family MBS exposure from $91.5 million at December 31, 2016 to $27.4 million at December 31, 2017 (on a non-GAAP combined basis); since year end, we have sold $5.9 million of the remaining Multi-Family exposure. We also completed the sale of all remaining residential mortgage loans prior to year-end. We continued to redeploy the capital released from selling down our credit exposure into Agency RMBS, which increased from $790.2 million at December 31, 2016 to $1,285.1 million at December 31, 2017. In order to minimize the potential impact of interest rate volatility, the increase was composed of purchases of Agency hybrid-ARMs. On June 16, 2017, we issued 4,600,000 shares of common stock, inclusive of the underwriters' overallotment option, for $4.60 per share, raising net proceeds of approximately $19.8 million. The Hunt Transaction On January 18, 2018, we announced a new strategic direction, and the entry into a new external management agreement with Hunt Investment Management, LLC, an affiliate of the Hunt Companies, Inc. (""Hunt"") and the concurrent mutual termination of our management agreement with Oak Circle. Management by Hunt is expected to provide Five Oaks with a new strategic direction through the reallocation of capital into new investment opportunities focused in the commercial real estate mortgage space and direct access to Hunt's significant pipeline of transitional floating-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans. Hunt and its affiliates have extensive experience in the origination, servicing, risk management and financing of this asset class and the floating-rate nature of the loans should reduce or eliminate the need for complex interest-rate hedging. The new management agreement is expected to better align our interests with those of our new manager through an incentive fee arrangement and agreed upon limitations on manager expense reimbursements from us, as further described below. Pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement between Five Oaks and Oak Circle, the termination of the prior management agreement did not trigger, and Oak Circle was not paid, a termination fee by us. Hunt separately agreed to pay Oak Circle a negotiated payment in connection with the termination agreement. In connection with the transaction, an affiliate of Hunt purchased 1,539,406 shares of our common stock in a private placement, at a purchase price of $4.77 per share resulting in an aggregate capital raise of $7,342,967. In addition, such Hunt affiliate also purchased 710,495 Five Oaks shares from our largest shareholder, XL Investments Ltd. (""XL Investments""), for the same price per share. The purchase price per share represents a 56.9% premium over the Five Oaks common share price as of the closing on January 17, 2018. In connection with the acquisition of shares from XL Investments, XL Investments agreed to terminate all of its currently held Five Oaks warrants. After completion of these share purchases, Hunt and its affiliates own approximately 9.5% of Five Oaks outstanding common shares. Also in connection with the transaction, and as further described in Sections 10 hereof and in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 18, 2018, David Carroll resigned as a director, Chairman and CEO of the Company and the Five Oaks board appointed James C. (""Chris"") Hunt as a director and Chairman of the board and named James P. Flynn as CEO of Five Oaks and Michael P. Larsen President of Five Oaks. FOAC and Changes to Our Residential Mortgage Loan Business In June 2013, we established FOAC as a Taxable REIT Subsidiary, or TRS, to increase the range of our investments in mortgage-related assets. Until August 1, 2016, FOAC aggregated mortgage loans primarily for sale into securitization transactions, with the expectation that we would purchase the subordinated tranches issued by the related securitization trusts, and that these will represent high quality credit investments for our portfolio. Residential mortgage loans for which FOAC owns the MSRs continue to be directly serviced by one or more licensed sub-servicers since FOAC does not directly service any residential mortgage loans. As noted earlier, we previously determined to cease the aggregation of prime jumbo loans for the foreseeable future, and therefore no longer maintain warehouse financing to acquire prime jumbo loans. We do not expect the changes to our mortgage loan business strategy to impact the existing MSRs that we own, or the securitizations we have sponsored to date. Multi-Family and Residential Mortgage Loan Consolidation Reporting Requirements As of December 31, 2017, we have determined that we are the primary beneficiary of two Multi-Family MBS securitization trusts, the FREMF 2011-K13 Trust and the FREMF 2012-KF01 Trust, and one prime jumbo residential mortgage securitization trust, CSMC 2014-OAK1, based in each case on our ownership of all or substantially all of the most subordinated, or first-loss, tranches in each transaction as well as the related control rights. We have elected the fair value option on the assets and liabilities held within each of the three trusts. In accordance with ASU 2014-13, we are required to determine whether the fair value of the financial assets or the fair value of the financial liabilities of each trust is more observable, but in either case, the methodology results in the fair value of the assets of each trust being equal to the fair value of the respective trust's liabilities. Securitization trusts are structured as pass through entities that receive principal and interest on the underlying collateral and distribute those payments to the certificate holders. Although our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2017 includes the gross assets and liabilities of the three trusts, the assets of each trust are restricted and can only be used to fulfill the obligations of the individual entity. Additionally, the obligations of the trusts do not have any recourse to us as the consolidator of the trusts. Accordingly, we are only exposed to the risk of loss on our net investment in the trusts. We do not have any claims to the assets (other than the security represented by our first loss piece) or obligations for the liabilities of any of the trusts. Our maximum exposure to loss from our consolidation is our carrying value of $27.1 million as of December 31, 2017, which represents our net aggregate investment in the trusts as set out below. As a result, for the purpose of describing our investment activities, we may present them on a net investment basis. As of December 31, 2017, we had $2,612,541,116 of total assets on a GAAP basis, as compared to $2,299,601,203 as of December 31, 2016. A reconciliation of our net investment in the trusts with our consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 follows:  December 31, 2017 December 31, 2016 Multi-family mortgage loans held in securitization trusts, at fair value(1) $ 1,135,251,880 $ 1,227,523,075 Multi-family securitized debt obligations(2) $ 1,113,556,782 $ 1,209,181,035 Net investment amount of Multi-Family MBS trusts held by us $ 21,695,098 $ 18,342,040 Residential mortgage loans held in securitization trusts, at fair value(1) $ 120,152,455 $ 141,597,866 Residential securitized debt obligations(2) $ 114,738,735 $ 135,223,045 Net investment amount of residential mortgage loan trusts held by us $ 5,413,720 $ 6,374,821  (1) Includes related receivables Five Oaks Insurance On January 12, 2016, the regulator of the FHLB system, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, or the FHFA, published a Final Rule that amended FHLB membership regulations for captive insurance subsidiaries. Under the regulations, FOI was required to terminate its membership and repay its advances on or before February 19, 2017 in order to be eligible for timely full stock redemption. On July 18, 2016, the State of Michigan Department of Financial Services approved FOI's order for voluntary dissolution. All FHLBI advances were repaid and all of the FHLBI stock had been redeemed prior to the end of 2016. Factors Impacting Our Operating Results Market conditions. The results of our operations are and will continue to be affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, our target assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which reflects the amortization of purchase premiums and accretion of purchase discounts, will vary primarily as a result of changes in market interest rates and prepayment speeds, as measured by the constant prepayment rate, or CPR, on our MBS and mortgage loans. Interest rates vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results are also impacted by unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers whose mortgage loans are included in our MBS, or whose loans we own directly. Our operating results will also be affected by general U.S. residential real estate fundamentals and the overall U.S. economic environment. In particular, our strategy is influenced by the specific characteristics of the residential real estate markets, including prepayment rates, credit market conditions and interest rate levels. On December 13, 2017, based on its outlook for economic activity, the labor market and inflation and weighing the uncertainties associated with this outlook, the Federal Reserve raised its target range for the federal funds rate to 1-� to 1-1/2 percent and on January 31, 2018, maintained the target range at 1-� to 1-1/2 percent. The Federal Reserve also indicated that it would likely contemplate additional rate increases in 2018 and beyond in a manner consistent with policy normalization, while indicating that such additional increases would likely be gradual and data dependent. Additionally, the Federal Reserve initiated its balance sheet normalization program in October 2017 that was announced in June 2017. This plan details the approach the FOMC intends to use to reduce the Federal Reserve's holding of Treasury and agency securities. For payments of principal that the Federal Reserve receives from its holdings of agency debt and mortgage-backed securities, the Committee anticipates that the cap will be $4 billion per month and will increase in steps of $4 billion in three-month intervals over 12 months until it reaches $20 billion per month. There is still considerable uncertainty concerning the speed at which the Federal Reserve will continue to raise rates. Such uncertainty and volatility often leads to asset price volatility, wider spreads and increased hedging costs, which in turn could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation and our ability to make distributions to our stockholders. Changes in market interest rates. With respect to our business operations, increases in interest rates, in general, may over time cause: (1) the value of our MBS and loan portfolio to decline; (2) coupons on our adjustable-rate and hybrid RMBS to reset, although on a delayed basis, to higher interest rates; Credit risk. We are subject to varying degrees of credit risk in connection with our Non-Agency RMBS and Multi-Family MBS investments. Our Manager seeks to mitigate this credit risk by estimating expected losses on these assets and purchasing such assets at appropriate discounted prices, e.g. for Non-Agency RMBS. Nevertheless, unanticipated credit losses could occur, which could adversely impact our operating results. Additionally, if the market's view of credit risk deteriorates, or the yield required to invest in such credit risk increases, this will generally lead to an increase in credit spreads, and a resultant decline in the market prices of such assets, even if our estimate of expected losses does not change. In turn, this can be expected to lead to a reduction in our stockholders' equity, and may also trigger margin calls under our repurchase agreements used to finance our credit sensitive assets. Liquidity and financing markets. Liquidity is a measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to pay dividends, fund investments and repay borrowings and other general business needs. Our primary sources of liquidity are net proceeds of common or preferred stock issuance, net cash provided by operating activities, cash from repurchase agreements, and other financing arrangements. We previously noted a tightening trend in the balance sheet capacity of repurchase agreement counterparties due to a combination of higher capital requirements such as Basel III capital reforms, other regulatory restrictions, enhanced risk management and generally lower risk appetite among many financial institutions. Consequently, we have observed a reduced willingness of certain financial institutions to commit capital to support the trading of fixed income securities, and in turn, a consequent reduction in certain cases in the availability of financing for certain credit-sensitive MBS. We anticipate our primary sources of financing in 2018 will be repurchase agreements and other similar financing arrangements. Prepayment speeds. Prepayment speeds, as reflected by the CPR, vary according to interest rates, the type of residential mortgage loan, conditions in financial markets and housing markets, availability of residential mortgages, borrowers' credit profiles, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. CPR, expressed as a percentage over a pool of residential mortgages, is the rate at which principal is expected to prepay in the given year (usually the next one). For example, if a certain residential mortgage loan pool has a CPR of 9%, then 9% of the existing pool principal outstanding is expected to prepay over the next year. In general, when interest rates rise, it is relatively less attractive for borrowers to refinance their residential mortgage loans, and as a result, prepayment speeds tend to decrease. When interest rates fall, however, prepayment speeds tend to increase. When house price appreciation is positive, prepayment rates may increase, and when house prices depreciate in value, prepayment rates may decline. For RMBS and loans purchased at a premium, as prepayment speeds increase, the amount of income we will earn on these investments will be less than expected because the purchase premium we will pay for the bonds amortizes faster than expected. Conversely, decreases in prepayment speeds result in income greater than expected and can extend the period over which we amortize the purchase premium. For RMBS and loans purchased at a discount, as prepayment speeds increase, the amount of income we will earn will be greater than expected because of the acceleration of the accretion of the discount into interest income. Conversely, decreases in prepayment speeds result in income less than expected and can extend the period over which we accrete the purchase discount into interest income. Generally, our Multi-Family MBS investments are not subject to prepayment risk, because scheduled repayments on the underlying multi-family mortgage loans are allocated to the most senior security in each transaction, and unscheduled repayments are held in the trust until the maturity date of the MBS securities. As a result, our Multi-Family MBS investments are generally scheduled to be repaid in full on a bullet maturity date. Changes in market value of our assets. Other than residential mortgage loans that we previously owned, as discussed below, it is our business strategy to hold our target assets as long-term investments. As such, our investment securities (with the exception of Non-Agency RMBS IOs) are carried at their fair value, as available-for-sale, or AFS, when applicable, in accordance with ASC 320-10 ""Investments-Debt and Equity Securities,"" with changes in fair value recorded through accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss), a component of stockholders' equity, rather than through earnings. However, at least on a quarterly basis, we monitor our target assets for other-than-temporary impairment, which could result in our recognizing a charge through earnings. See ""Critical Accounting Policies"" for further details. The primary exception to this accounting policy relates to residential mortgage loans, which we previously held with the intent to sell, either into a securitization transaction, or into the secondary market. We have elected the fair value option for mortgage loan assets, as well as Non-Agency RMBS IOs, and as such, changes in the market value of these assets will directly impact our earnings. In addition, to the extent that as a result of our purchase of subordinated securities issued by Multi-Family MBS and residential mortgage loan securitization trusts, we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of these trusts and accordingly consolidate their assets and liabilities; we have elected the fair value option in respect of these trusts. As such, changes in the market values of the consolidated trusts will also directly impact our earnings. Governmental actions. Since 2008, when both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed under the conservatorship of the U.S. government, there have been a number of proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance system in general, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in particular. As a result of the recent change in the presidential administration, we anticipate debate on residential housing and mortgage reform to continue into 2018 and beyond, but a deep divide persists between factions in Congress and as such it remains unclear what shape any reform would take and what impact, if any, reform would have on mortgage REITs. Investment Portfolio On a GAAP basis, we had increased our overall investments in MBS from $870.9 million as of December 31, 2016 to $1,290.8 million as of December 31, 2017. Within this total, on a year-over-year basis we had increased our Agency RMBS from $790.2 million to $1,285.1 million, decreased our Non-Agency RMBS from $7.6 million to $0.0 million and decreased our Multi-Family MBS from $73.1 million to $5.7 million. These changes reflect the application of our current investment strategy discussed under ""Overview"". On a non-GAAP basis, our MBS investments increased from $894.5 million as of December 31, 2016 to $1,316.9 million as of December 31, 2017. The non-GAAP total includes our net investment in our consolidated Multi-Family MBS and residential mortgage loan trusts. Within these totals, on a year-over-year basis . . .

OAKS,"NEW YORK, Jan. 18, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Five Oaks Investment Corp. OAKS, -0.67% (""Five Oaks"" or the ""Company"") announced today that its independent directors unanimously approved the entry into a new management agreement with Hunt Investment Management, LLC, a subsidiary of Hunt Companies, Inc. ()Hunt"") and the concurrent mutual termination of its management agreement with  Oak Circle Capital Partners LLC ()OCCP"").  Management by Hunt is expected to provide Five Oaks with a new strategic direction through the reallocation of capital into new investment opportunities focused in the commercial real estate mortgage space and direct access to Hunt's significant pipeline of specified transitional floating-rate multi-family and commercial real estate loans.  Hunt and its affiliates have extensive experience in the origination, servicing, risk management and financing of this asset class and the floating-rate nature of the loans should reduce or eliminate the need for complex interest-rate hedging.  The new management agreement is expected to better align the interests of Five Oaks and its new manager through an incentive fee arrangement and agreed upon limitations on manager expense reimbursements from the Company, among other items, as further described in the Company's Form 8-K referenced below. Hunt Investment Management, LLC is an SEC registered investment advisor with nearly $2.0 billion of real estate assets managed in funds, separate accounts and other portfolios, across all real estate sectors and properties located in the US.  The activities of Hunt's affiliates and investees include investment management, mortgage banking, direct lending, loan servicing, asset management, property management, development, construction, consulting and advisory.  Pursuant to the terms of the termination agreement between Five Oaks and OCCP, the termination of the management agreement did not trigger, and OCCP was not paid, a termination fee by Five Oaks.  Hunt separately agreed to pay OCCP a negotiated payment in connection with the foregoing. In connection with the transaction, an affiliate of Hunt purchased 1,539,406 shares of the Company's common stock in a private placement by the Company, at a purchase price of $4.77 per share resulting in an aggregate capital raise of $7,342,966.62.  In addition, an affiliate of Hunt also purchased 710,495 Five Oaks shares from the Company's largest current shareholder, XL Investments Ltd, for the same price per share.  The purchase price per share represents a 56.9% premium over the Five Oaks common share price as of the closing on January 17, 2018.  In connection with the acquisition of shares from XL Investments, XL Investments agreed to terminate all of its currently held Five Oaks warrants.  After completion of these share purchases, Hunt and its affiliates own approximately 9.5% of Five Oaks outstanding common shares. Also in connection with the transaction, Mr. David Carroll resigned as a director, Chairman and CEO of the Company and the Five Oaks board appointed James C. (""Chris"") Hunt as a director and Chairman of the board and named James P. Flynn as CEO of Five Oaks and Michael P. Larsen President of Five Oaks.  Mr. Flynn currently serves as President and CIO of Hunt's commercial real estate lending unit and Mr. Larsen serves as COO and CFO of Hunt's commercial real estate lending unit.  It is expected that current Five Oaks executives, David Carroll, David Oston, and Paul Chong, will sign employment agreements with Hunt and a majority of the current employees of OCCP will become employees of Hunt. Following the transaction, the Board will continue to be comprised of a majority of independent directors. Chris Hunt, Chief Executive Officer of Hunt stated, ""I look forward to joining the Five Oaks Board and working with the Company to help build value for all stockholders.  I believe that our investment today in Five Oaks demonstrates our belief in the platform and future success of the Company and aligns the interests of Hunt as external manager with those of the stockholders of Five Oaks as we seek to grow the Company in the coming years."" James Flynn, the new CEO of Five Oaks, stated, ""With access to the breadth and scale of the Hunt platform, we believe Hunt will provide value and stability for the stockholders of Five Oaks.  Hunt's significant expertise in commercial real estate lending and access to commercial real estate investment opportunities will enable Five Oaks to expand its investment strategy. In addition, we expect Five Oaks to benefit from the scale of Hunt's investment management platform to reduce expense levels and increase its capital base."" David Carroll, the former CEO and Chairman of Five Oaks stated, ""I am fully supportive of the transactions announced today.  I believe that gaining access to Hunt's wide-ranging commercial real estate platform, proven track record and highly seasoned management team will deliver positive benefits to the Company and its stockholders.  Increased access to the floating-rate transitional loan origination pipeline, particularly in the multi-family space, should allow us to transition the Company's portfolio towards attractively priced, high quality loans that are positively correlated to rising interest rates and financed with term repurchase facilities or collateralized loan obligation financing.  I believe this will be positive for stockholder returns moving forward."" Mr. William A. Houlihan, Five Oaks' lead independent director, stated, ""We are excited by this transaction and our partnership with Hunt.  We believe that Hunt's stewardship will be beneficial to the Company and our stockholders and we look forward to Chris Hunt's insights and perspectives as a member of our Board.""

OAKS,"NEW YORK, Aug. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Five Oaks Investment Corp. OAKS, -0.34% (""we"", ""Five Oaks"" or ""the Company"") today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. For the second quarter, the Company reported a GAAP net loss of $3.2 million, or $0.17 per basic and diluted share, a comprehensive loss of $5.3 million, or $0.29 per basic and diluted share, and core earnings [ (1)] of $2.2 million, or $0.12 per basic and diluted share. The Company also reported a net book value of $5.41 per share on a basic and diluted basis at June 30, 2017. Second Quarter Summary We reported an economic loss on common equity of 9.45% (37.79% annualized), comprised of a $0.73 decrease in book value per share and a $0.15 dividend per common share [(2)] . The decrease in book value was due in approximately equal measure to unrealized losses related to our Agency RMBS portfolio as spreads widened during the quarter, and the dilutive effect of our common stock issuance in June. On June 21, 2017 we completed an underwritten public offering of 4,600,000 shares of common stock, including 600,000 shares upon the exercise in full of the underwriters' over-allotment option, for estimated net proceeds of $19.8 million. We believe this was an important step in attempting to scale our business, improve the trading liquidity of our stock and continuing to reduce our expense ratio over time. As a result of the widening in Agency ARM spreads during the quarter, we were able to invest the proceeds of our common stock issuance at more attractive levels than would have been available earlier in the quarter. [(1)] Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure that we define as GAAP net income, excluding impairment losses, realized and unrealized gains or losses on the aggregate portfolio and certain non-recurring upfront costs related to securitization transactions or other one-time charges. As defined, Core Earnings includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments. [(2)] Economic return is a non-GAAP measure that we define as the sum of the change in net book value per common share and dividends declared on our common stock during the period over the beginning net book value per common share. Management Observations David Carroll, Five Oaks' Chairman and CEO, commented: ""In the second quarter the yield curve flattened as the 'Trumpflation' expectation receded further and quantitative easing in Japan and the EU put downward pressure on intermediate and long rates in the U.S. The 2/10's treasury curve flattened 30 bps during the quarter to a low of 78 bps. The Federal Reserve tightened short rates as expected in June and also gave clear and detailed signals that it intends to begin reducing its balance sheet in the near term. In recent years, the Fed has purchased approximately one out of every three Treasury and agency mortgage securities. In its own research, the Fed views the eventual withdrawal of its purchases as adding a term premium of approximately 100 bps to the term structure of interest rates over time. We believe the 'terminal' rate (i.e. the apex of policy interest rates during the business cycle) is likely closer to the inflation rate, which has been running below 2%. Given the Fed's indication that they are close to commencing balance sheet reduction, we believe we are closer to the end of the Fed's traditional rate tightening cycle. It also appears that the EU is now contemplating reducing its balance sheet based on comments in late June from Mario Draghi, the ECB President, that led to a reversal in the flattening trend in the U.S. A steeper yield curve and wider spreads are positive for a levered Agency hybrid strategy and potentially provides a strong multi-year tail wind to returns as the Fed balance sheet is reduced. ""With the flattening of the curve, spreads on Agency hybrid securities widened by approximately 20 bps in the quarter as investors demanded higher absolute yields. Wider spreads and the resultant unrealized losses on our investment portfolio contributed approximately half of the $0.73 reduction in book value per share versus the end of the first quarter. The remainder resulted from the common stock follow-on offering that we completed shortly before quarter end. While dilutive to existing holders, the one day marketed transaction provided both existing and new investors the opportunity to invest at the lower price point, and we were able to attract meaningful institutional investor demand. Wider Agency hybrid spreads allowed us to invest offering proceeds at attractive levels, and just as importantly, incremental equity helps the Company to continue scaling down its expense ratio. Over the past year, we have pivoted the investment strategy to concentrate on Agency hybrid ARMs, which we believe provide both attractive yields and positive price 'roll' down the curve along with enhanced extension protection from any sustained rise in interest rates. ""In parallel with our more focused investment strategy, we have been diligently working to reduce our overall expense load to better reflect the Company's revised business model. Exiting the loan aggregation and securitization business has already allowed us to reduce our expense run rate since the middle of last year, and we have recently engaged in dialogues with our external manager to seek additional economies in the expenses for which they seek reimbursement from us. These reimbursable expenses have to date been reduced from an annualized level of $4.7 million in the second quarter of 2016 to $3.8 million in the second quarter of 2017. Historically, approximately 75% of the reimbursable expenses have been accounted for by compensation paid to non-investment management professionals employed by our manager to support our business. Recognizing the significance of this expense, our manager has committed to limit the non-investment management professional compensation-related expenses for which it will seek reimbursement from us to a maximum of $2 million for a period of 12 months commencing October 1, 2017, unless our board of directors agrees in advance to additional payments. We believe this commitment by our manager to expense reduction demonstrates our continued focus on transitioning to an 'expense light' business model, and further supports Five Oaks' chosen strategy of providing investors with access to an attractive niche within the mortgage REIT sector.""

These forward-looking statements include information about possible or assumed future results of the Company's business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, plans and objectives. You can identify forward-looking statements by use of words such as ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""anticipate,"" ""estimate,"" ""plan,"" ""continue,"" ""intend,"" ""should,"" ""may"" or similar expressions or other comparable terms, or by discussions of strategy, plans or intentions. Statements regarding the following subjects, among others, may be forward-looking: the return on equity; the yield on investments; the ability to borrow to finance assets; and risks associated with investing in real estate assets, including changes in business conditions, interest rates, the general economy and political conditions and related matters. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's beliefs, assumptions and expectations of its future performance, taking into account all information currently available to the Company. Actual results may differ from expectations, estimates and projections and, consequently, you should not rely on these forward looking statements as predictions of future events. Forward-looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, many of which are difficult to predict and are generally beyond the Company's control. Additional information concerning these and other risk factors are contained in the Company's most recent filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which are available on the Securities and Exchange Commission's website at www.sec.gov. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements that the Company makes, or that are attributable to the Company, are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary notice. Any forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made. Except as required by law, the Company is not obligated to, and does not intend to, update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Non-GAAP Financial Measures For financial statement reporting purposes, GAAP requires us to consolidate the assets and liabilities of the FREMF 2011-K13, FREMF 2012-KF01, and CSMC 2014-OAK1 Trusts.  However, our maximum exposure to loss from consolidation of the trusts is limited to the fair value of our net investment therein. We therefore have also presented certain information as of June 30, 2017 and March 31, 2017 that includes our net investments in the consolidated trusts. This information as well as core earnings, economic return and comparative expenses constitute non-GAAP financial measures within the meaning of Item 10(e) of Regulation S-K, as promulgated by the SEC. While we believe the non-GAAP information included in this press release provides supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing that portion of our portfolio composed of Non-Agency RMBS and Multi-Family MBS, and to assist investors in comparing our results with other peer issuers, these measures are not in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.

OAKS,"NEW YORK, May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Five Oaks Investment Corp. OAKS, -0.69% (""we"", ""Five Oaks"" or ""the Company"") today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. For the first quarter, the Company reported GAAP net income of $1.5 million, or $0.08 per basic and diluted share, comprehensive income of $5.0 million, or $0.29 per basic and diluted share, and core earnings [ (1)] of $2.7 million, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share. The Company also reported a net book value of $6.14 per share on a basic and diluted basis at March 31, 2017. First Quarter Summary Realized a positive economic return on our common stock of 4.8% (19.3% annualized), comprised of $0.14 increase in net book value per share and $0.15 dividend per common share [(2)] . We continued the reduction of Non-Agency RMBS exposure from $12.8 million at December 31, 2016 to $4.9 million at March 31, 2017 (on a non-GAAP combined basis).  We also reduced our Multi-Family MBS exposure from $91.5 million at December 31, 2016 to $55.5 million at March 31, 2017. We continued to redeploy a portion of the capital released from selling down our credit exposure into Agency RMBS, which increased from $790.2 million at December 31, 2016 to $999.9 million at March 31, 2017. In order to minimize the potential impact of interest rate volatility, the increase was composed of purchases of Agency hybrid-ARMs. [(1)] Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure that we define as GAAP net income, excluding impairment losses, realized and unrealized gains or losses on the aggregate portfolio and certain non-recurring upfront costs related to securitization transactions or other one-time charges. As defined, Core Earnings includes interest income or expense and premium income or loss on derivative instruments. [(2)] Economic return is a non-GAAP measure that we define as the sum of the change in net book value per common share and dividends declared on our common stock during the period over the beginning net book value per common share. Management Observations David Carroll, Five Oaks' Chairman and CEO commented: ""As we had anticipated when reporting our fourth quarter 2016 results, market expectations for speedy implementation of the new administration's economic and fiscal plans faded somewhat during the first quarter, and market conditions as a result exhibited lower volatility than the prior quarter. The 10-year treasury fluctuated within a relatively narrow band of 2.31% to 2.63%, but uncertainty persists with regard to the extent and timing of future Federal Reserve interest rate increases as well as the manner in which the Fed plans to begin reducing their balance sheet investment portfolio. Mortgage spreads have already widened out somewhat since quarter end, likely in anticipation of future Fed actions, and we retain a defensive bias in expectation that there may be further spread widening to come as such actions unfold. We have now effectively completed our transition to a simpler business strategy that is easier to understand. In particular, we have sold substantially all of our Non-Agency RMBS securities, and significantly reduced our Multi-Family MBS exposure, focusing on those positions that were repo financed. We have continued to reallocate a portion of the capital released from these sales into intermediate Agency hybrid floating-rate securities, a sector that we believe still offers attractive risk-adjusted investment opportunities, and for which financing conditions remain positive after last year's money market reforms. I am particularly pleased that an increase of $0.14 in book value per share made a positive contribution to our overall economic return of 4.8% for the quarter. While this will not always be possible should volatility spike again, I do believe it validates our continued focus on methodical and dynamic hedging strategies. On the cost side, as is typical, the first quarter included some front-loading of annual expenses and some residual expenses associated with our exit from the prime jumbo business. We expect the cost reduction benefits of this to be evident over the remainder of the year, Looking ahead to the balance of 2017, we will continue to search for incremental cost saving opportunities, as well as further growth of our backstop guarantee business for rep and warranty risk on prime jumbo mortgage loans. When combined with our core holdings in Multi-Family MBS, I believe that our simplified business strategy concentrated on the Agency hybrid sector positions us well within the mortgage REIT sector"". Investment Portfolio and Capital Allocation The following table summarizes certain characteristics of our investment portfolio and the related allocation of our equity capital on a non-GAAP combined basis as of March 31, 2017: For the period ended March 31, 2017 Agency MBS Multi-Family MBS(1)(2) Non-AgencyRMBS (1)(2) ResidentialLoans (3) UnrestrictedCash  (4) Total Amortized Cost 1,002,116,876 52,876,433 11,063,929 7,784,817 32,713,356 1,106,555,411 Market Value 999,910,670 55,451,871 4,877,688 7,265,907 32,713,356 1,100,219,492 Repurchase Agreements (948,712,000) (20,362,000) (2,151,000) - - (971,225,000) Hedges 4,872,365 104,573 - - - 4,976,938 Other (5) 4,585,765 (26,950) 58,632 12,563 (506,150) 4,123,860 Restricted Cash and Due to Broker 6,792,125 (14,595) - - - 6,777,530 Equity Allocated 67,448,925 35,152,899 2,785,320 7,278,470 32,207,206 144,872,820               Debt/Net Equity (6) 14.07 0.58 0.77 - - 6.70               For the period ended March 31, 2017 Agency MBS Multi-Family MBS Non-AgencyRMBS Residential   Loans (7) UnrestrictedCash Total Yield on Earning Assets (8) 2.67% 8.84% -0.49% 49.37% - 3.16% Less Cost of Funds 0.85% 1.10% 0.79% - - 0.86% Net Interest Margin (9) 1.82% 7.74% -1.28% 49.37% - 2.30%    (1)   Information with respect to Non-Agency RMBS and Multi-Family MBS, and the resulting total is presented on a non-GAAP basis.

The increase in G&A, Other Operating, Reimbursable and Compensation Expenses as a percentage of Capital over the past quarter is primarily a function of higher audit, administrator and legal expenses relative to the fourth quarter of 2016. Certain of these expenses are front-loaded for the year, and accordingly we anticipate a decline in such expenses for the remainder of 2017.

While we believe the non-GAAP information included in this press release provides supplemental information to assist investors in analyzing that portion of our portfolio composed of Non-Agency RMBS and Multi-Family MBS, and to assist investors in comparing our results with other peer issuers, these measures are not in accordance with GAAP, and they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, our financial information calculated in accordance with GAAP. Our GAAP financial results and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.
