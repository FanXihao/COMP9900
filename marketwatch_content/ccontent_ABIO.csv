ABIO,"Reuters Traders work on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — Nearly a dozen years after becoming an option for individuals, after-hours stock trading is risky for retail investors, as volume remains a sliver of overall trade and in fact has declined over time. High volatility, less transparency, higher per-trade fees and increased competition from professionals are among the risks involved with trading U.S.-exchange listed stocks after the regular U.S. stock-market session from 4 p.m. until 8 p.m Eastern, and in a short window before the next session opens. Premarket stock trading occurs between 8 to 9:30 a.m. Eastern. MARKETS | • The Tell: Market news and analysis • | Canada section • Columns: Stocks | Oil | Gold | Bonds | Dollar  TOOLS AND DATA | • My Portfolio: Know where your funds are? • Real-time currency exchange rates • After-hours stock screener After-hours trading is “absolutely more risky, there’s no doubt,” according to Randy Frederick, director of trading and derivatives at Charles Schwab. This trading arena is ringed by so many red flags that the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an investor alert on off-hours trading late last month, saying investors should be aware the rules can “differ significantly” than those governing regular trades. For instance, the regulatory agency hasn’t instituted the same circuit-breakers on individual stocks trading after hours that it imposed for regular trading after last year’s “flash crash.” In addition, the spreads — or differences between the bid and ask prices — have a tendency to be very wide, and many players are not visible, with retail players likely to be trading against large institutional investors, regulators, Frederick and other market observers said. One of the top risks cited by regulators, such as low liquidity, has shown no sign of reversing. Off-hours volume as a percentage of overall trade has declined over the last several years, rather than expand as the market matured. About 2% of volume in Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. NDAQ, +3.27% and stocks listed on the NYSE Euronext’s NYX, +0.20%  New York Stock Exchange is generated off hours, with the volume of trades split between premarket and after-hours trading, said Wayne Lee, a spokesman for Nasdaq OMX. That’s down from 3% of volume in June 2000, roughly a year after after-hours trading became available to nonprofessional traders, according to SEC estimates. Going global While the SEC and Nasdaq declined to speculate on why volumes have fallen, one reason may be that we now operate in a global market. Index futures, as opposed to the individual stocks that move over the stock-exchange platforms after hours, give investors an avenue to react to corporate, economic or geopolitical news practically around the clock. Stock-index futures including S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38%  futures, Nasdaq 100 futures and Russell Index futures “trade almost 24 hours a day,” said Elliot Spar, market strategist at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Still, overnight and early-morning trading in index futures can suffer from some of the same constraints as off-hours stock trading. Liquidity is often thin and traders cannot lay off risk in the underlying basket of stocks. “In other words, many of the moves in after-hours trading are exaggerated,” added Spar. Rogers: Only a Crisis Can Fix U.S. Debt Problem Once restricted to high net-worth investors or institutional investors such as mutual funds, off-hours stock trading came into play for the retail investor in mid-1999, viewed as a way for investors to react to stock news, such as earnings reports, coming after the regular market has closed or before it opens. Broker-dealers began offering retail customers a means of directing orders to Electronic Communication Networks, or ECNs, to be eligible for execution after the close of the regular-trading session. The bulk of trading in the session occurs directly following the closes at 4 p.m. Eastern. “Company news is the main driver behind after-hours trading. It’s more of a news play on an acquisition or earnings,” said Stephen Ehrlich, the chief executive at broker Lightspeed Financial LLC. “Liquidity is not as deep, but there is still opportunity,” he added, noting that as much as 5% of Lightspeed’s volume gets executed in the after-hours market. Keith Springer, president of Springer Financial Advisors, has made after-hours trades “for clients who call me after the close and need to raise money, or when I’ve speculated on one of the big company earnings, or when I needed to make a trade and I forgot.” But, after-hours trading “is harder to do than you might think; there are not that many shares available and they don’t have to make an orderly market,” Springer cautioned. Execution issues Executing an order after hours is often not feasible, given there may not be market makers active in many or all stocks. “In fact, some stocks may not trade at all during after-hours trading,” advised regulators from the SEC’s Office of Investor Education and Advocacy. What’s more, not all of the SEC’s market rules apply to after-hours trades, including the circuit-breaker program expanded by the regulatory agency in September after the so-called May 6, 2010 “flash crash” that had the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  plunging nearly 1,000 points before recouping the bulk of that loss by the close. The market rules mandating a trading “pause” in a stock if its price moves up or down by 10% or more in a five-minute period would be hard to extend after hours, given the difficulty of devising workable, meaningful levels for trading where low liquidity often translates into high volatility. During regular trading, buyers and sellers of most stocks actively compete on prices, making it relatively easy to quickly buy or sell with little effect on prices. But after hours, “the bid-ask spread is so wide you can drive a truck through it,” remarked Jim Angel, a professor of finance at Georgetown University. Take one recent premarket-trading session: On May 26, shares of equipment maker CNH Global N.V. CNH, +26.92%  rose 9.1% before the opening bell after a brokerage upgrade. In the regular session, the stock added a more modest 4%. In that same session, Arca Biopharma Inc. ABIO, +1.71%  surged 8.8% ahead of the open after it said it would expand a trial of its cardiovascular-drug candidate to include patients with atrial fibrillation. It then gained only 2.2% during the day. Likewise, Semtech Corp. SMTC, +1.17%  jumped 8% in the premarket a day after the semiconductor maker reported first-quarter results that topped expectations, with its shares then gaining 3.6% during the regular session. Cuban a player Investors who opt to trade after hours should always use a limit order, which can only be executed at the limit price or better, to protect themselves from unexpectedly poor prices, recommended Springer, given the potentially wide spread between the bid and ask prices. One high-profile example of what can occur after hours involves billionaire and Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban. Reuters Mark Cuban In the still-pending case, the SEC alleges Cuban violated insider-trading rules by selling his stake in Mamma.com after learning of the Canadian search engine’s plan to sell a stake to private investors — a move regulators say Cuban viewed as one that would dilute its 6.3% stake. “Well now I’m screwed. I can’t sell,” Cuban was quoted in the SEC suit as telling Mamma.com Chief Executive Guy Faure at the end of a June 28, 2004, phone call. During after-hours trading the same day, Cuban sold 10,000 of his 600,000 Mamma.com shares, selling the remainder during regular trading the next day in moves that the SEC contends helped the tycoon avoid more than $750,000 in losses. A federal appeals court in Texas in September sent back for trial the case against Cuban, who has filed a countersuit, alleging that the SEC brought the case against him in bad faith. Moves by a large investor in a stock, at a time of day when there are few buyers and sellers around to compete on prices, can add to volatility in the off-hours market. For some financial advisers and experts, it’s just too dicey for the small-time investor. After-hours trading largely involves “fools or people trying to make money off those fools,” said Georgetown’s Angel, who likens the action to taking a stroll through Manhattan’s largest pubic park in the middle of the night. “Who are you going to find in Central Park at 3 a.m. but a bunch of drunks and predators looking to roll them?” Angel added most retail investors should heed the following advice: “Stay away.” More from MarketWatch My husband sold his grandmother’s house and paid off our mortgage — now his family is threatening to sue Jobless claims drop 4,000 to 226,000 Home sellers now use spycams to gather intel on prospective buyers Related Topics U.S. Stocks Markets NY Stock Exchange NASDAQ","June 9, 2011 3:23 p.m. ET",1,"After-hours trades still risky, a decade later",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-hours-trades-still-risky-a-decade-later-2011-06-09

ABIO,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations We have included or incorporated by reference into this Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and from time to time our management may make, statements that constitute ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of information expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. While we believe that we have a reasonable basis for each forward-looking statement contained in this Annual Report, we caution you that these statements are based on a combination of facts and factors currently known by us and our projections of the future, about which we cannot be certain. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on related subjects in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and our website. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient through the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Our lead product candidate, Gencaro(TM) (bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that we are developing for the potential treatment of patients with chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, or HFrEF, who also have atrial fibrillation, or AF, or at risk of developing AF. HFrEF constitutes an estimated 50-60% of the total heart failure, or HF, population, with the remainder comprised of HF with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF. We believe that Gencaro's efficacy is enhanced in a specific genotype that is present in approximately fifty percent of the general population in the United States, and can be identified by a genetic test. We believe that with this genetic test, we may be able to predict individual patient response to Gencaro, potentially improving the efficacy of treatment for AF in HFrEF patients with this particular genotype. We believe that Gencaro, if approved, could potentially be a safer and more effective therapy for treating or preventing AF in patients with HFrEF and could be the first genetically-targeted AF treatment. We also believe that Gencaro may have market exclusivity based on patents and new chemical entity status, if approved in the United States, Europe or other markets. In February 2018, we reported the results of our Phase 2B clinical superiority trial, known as GENETIC-AF, in which we evaluated Gencaro for the treatment and prevention of AF in patients with HFrEF. The GENETIC-AF trial only enrolled patients with the beta�1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. In our trial, HFrEF is defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, of less than 50%. GENETIC-AF compared Gencaro to TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), a drug approved for treating HFrEF that is also prescribed, but not approved, for treating AF in patients with HFrEF. Overall, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit compared to the active comparator, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). In U.S. patients (127 of 267 total patients), a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 30% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL), was observed for the primary endpoint of time to recurrence of AF. Additionally, in U.S. patients, Gencaro demonstrated a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 51% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL) in a subset of patients who underwent continuous heart rhythm monitoring with Medtronic implanted devices. Safety data indicated that Gencaro was generally safe and well-tolerated in the AF/HF population investigated with a safety profile similar to TOPROL-XL. GENETIC-AF enrolled 267 patients from the United States, Canada and Europe. The primary analysis was conducted to evaluate the evidence of safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus an active comparator, TOPROL-XL. The primary endpoint of the trial was time to recurrent AF, atrial flutter, or AFL, or all-cause mortality, or ACM. The trial was not powered to conventional significance for this endpoint and utilized Bayesian statistical modeling of predictive probability of success, or PPoS, of the primary endpoint to estimate outcome if the trial had enrolled 620 patients with 330 primary events. Overall, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit compared to the active comparator, TOPROL-XL (143 total events, hazard ratio of 1.01 [95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.42]), which was associated with a PPoS of 14%. In the U.S. patient cohort of 127 patients (approximately 50% of all patients and events), a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro over TOPROL-XL was observed (73 events, hazard ratio 0.70, [95% confidence interval: 0.41, 1.19]), with a PPoS of 61%, which was greater than the prespecified criteria set by us to proceed to Phase 3 development. We believe the difference in treatment effects between the overall and U.S. patient cohorts was primarily due to results in two non-U.S. countries exhibiting hazard ratios >1.0. The differences between patients enrolled at these sites versus the United States and other country cohorts are being investigated. A subgroup of patients underwent continuous (24/7) heart rhythm monitoring via Medtronic implanted loop recorders or other Medtronic implanted therapeutic devices (e.g., ICDs, CRTs) to evaluate daily AF burden. AF burden was defined as the amount of time per day a patient experienced AF, as measured by an implanted device. A prespecified time-to-first event analysis was conducted using a total AF burden of at least 6 hours per day to define an event of AF recurrence. In this analysis, hazard ratios of 0.75 (0.43, 1.32) and 0.49 (0.24, 1.04) were observed in the overall (n=69) and U.S. patient (n=42) cohorts, respectively. Gencaro was generally safe and well-tolerated, with 84% of patients attaining their target dose compared to 72% of patients receiving TOPROL-XL. The most frequently reported adverse events were similar in both groups and consistent with the known safety profile of the beta-blocker class of drugs. Adverse events assessed as related to study drug by the investigator occurred in 23.8% of patients in the Gencaro group and in 30.1% of patients in the TOPROL-XL group. Of note, adverse events of bradycardia were less frequently reported in the Gencaro group (3.7%) compared to patients receiving TOPROL-XL (12.0%). During the 24-week efficacy follow-up period there were three deaths (ACM) in the TOPROL-XL group and none in the Gencaro group. Three patients died in the long-term treatment extension period after receiving Gencaro for more than a year. Our current development of Gencaro is, in part, based on a prospectively designed DNA substudy of adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in the BEST trial, a previous Phase 3 study of 2,708 HF patients. Based on data from the BEST trial, Gencaro showed potential evidence of enhanced efficacy in treating AF and in reducing mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients with the beta�1 389 arginine homozygous genotype. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, designated the investigation of Gencaro for the prevention of AF in a genetically targeted heart failure population (HF patients with reduced LVEF) as a Fast Track development program. AF, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is a potentially serious disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart's two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular, rapid and uncoordinated. AF commonly occurs together with HFrEF, with AF being both a cause and a result of HFrEF. By increasing heart rate and producing irregular cycle lengths, AF may contribute to the disease processes that leads to the progression of HFrEF and worsening clinical outcomes. AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease and a major public health burden. The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2015 was 33.3 million. According to the 2017 American Heart Association report on Cardiovascular Disease, approximately 5.2 million people in the United States had atrial fibrillation in 2015. Hospitalization rates for AF increased by 23% among U.S. adults from 2000 to 2010 and hospitalizations account for the majority of the economic cost burden associated with AF. In a global registry of AF patients, the rates of heart failure (of all types) ranged from 33% in patients with paroxysmal (episodes lasting 7 days or less) to 56% in patients with permanent AF. We believe there is a significant need for drug therapies that are safe and effective for HFrEF patients with AF or at risk of developing it, as the existing drug therapies for the treatment or prevention AF have certain safety disadvantages in HFrEF patients, such as toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects. Most of the approved drugs for AF are contra indicated or have warnings in their prescribing information for such patients. Consequently, in the treatment and prevention of AF in HFrEF patients, we believe there is an unmet medical need for new treatments that have fewer side effects and are more effective than currently available therapies. We believe that data from the BEST trial indicate that Gencaro may have a genetically regulated effect in reducing or preventing AF in HFrEF patients. A retrospective analysis of data from the BEST trial shows that all patients in the trial treated with Gencaro had a 41% reduction in the risk of new onset AF (time-to-event) compared to placebo (p = 0.0004). In a substudy in the trial, which considered only patients with the genotype believed to enhance Gencaro's efficacy (known as the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype), patients treated with Gencaro experienced a 74% (p = 0.0003) reduction in risk of AF, based on the same analysis. In addition, the BEST study, the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype Gencaro demonstrated enhanced efficacy in reducing mortality, hospitalizations, and ventricular tachycardia /ventricular fibrillation, or VT/VF. Furthermore, patients with a beta�1 389 arginine homozygous genotype who entered the trial in AF had statistically significant reductions in major cardiovascular or HF mortality/hospitalization composite endpoints, which we believe is the first and thus far only demonstration of effectiveness of a beta-blocker in reducing major HF events in HFrEF patients with permanent AF. The beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype was present in about 50% of the patients screened and all enrolled patients in the GENETIC-AF trial and 47% of the patients in the BEST pharmacogenetic substudy, and we estimate it is present in about 50% of the North American and European general populations. GENETIC-AF was completed as a Phase 2B, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro against an active comparator, the beta-blocker TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), that enrolled 267 patients. Eligible patients had HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro. We believe that Gencaro may be potentially unique in the beta-blocker class of drugs due to its apparent pharmacologic interaction with the beta-1 adrenergic receptor polymorphism. We received guidance from the FDA regarding the GENETIC-AF clinical trial prior to initiation of the trial. The trial enrolled patients in the United States, Canada and Europe and completed enrollment in August 2017. In August 2017, the GENETIC-AF Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, conducted a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy and recommended completing the Phase 2B trial with no changes to the trial design. All 267 patients completed their last study visits and were transitioned off study drug by the end of December 2017. We have been granted patents in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions for methods of treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro based on genetic testing. We believe our patent portfolio and new chemical entity exclusivity may provide market exclusivity for the indications of Gencaro that we may develop, into approximately 2030 or 2031 in the United States, Europe and other markets. Our GENETIC-AF Phase 2B trial was completed in February 2018 and we believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which includes $3.4 million of net proceeds raised in January 2018 from sales of our common stock, will be sufficient to fund our operations, at our projected cost structure, through the end of 2018. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate. In January 2017, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $7.3 million, in an ""at the market offering."" In August 2017, we amended our sales agreement to increase the maximum aggregate value of shares which we may issue and sell from time to time under this sales agreement by approximately $2.9 million, from $7.3 million to $10.2 million. As of January 19, 2018, we have sold an aggregate of 4,811,353 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement, as amended, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $10.1 million. Net proceeds received in the period were approximately $9.5 million, after deducting initial expenses for executing the ""at the market offering"" and commissions paid to the placement agent. We have sold all shares available under the current prospectus. Results of Operations Research and Development Expenses Research and development, or R&D, expense is comprised primarily of clinical development, manufacturing process development, and regulatory activities and costs. Our R&D expense continues to be almost entirely generated by our activities relating to the development of Gencaro. Our research and development expenses were $14.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $12.3 million for 2016. The $1.7 million increase in research and development expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to the increased expense of our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. Clinical expense increased approximately $2.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2017. The cost increase was primarily due to clinical trial cost activities, as well as increased personnel costs. The increase in costs were related to our GENETIC-AF clinical trial, including contract research organization, or CRO, costs, clinical site monitoring activities, patient visit costs and increased costs to support expanding into Europe. Manufacturing process development costs decreased approximately $0.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The decrease was a result of decreased of production of clinical trial materials used in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial, completed in 2017. We expect R&D expense in 2018 to be lower than 2017 as our GENETIC-AF clinical trial has been completed. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses, or G&A, primarily consist of personnel costs, consulting and professional fees, insurance, facilities and depreciation expenses, and various other administrative costs. G&A expenses were $4.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2017, compared to $4.3 million for 2016, an increase of approximately $0.4 million. The increase in expenses during 2017 was comprised primarily of costs incurred to acquire Aeolus' minority membership interest in CPEC and higher consulting costs and professional fees, partially offset by decreased non-cash, stock-based compensation expense in 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. G&A expenses in 2018 are expected to be consistent with those in 2017 as we maintain administrative activities to support our ongoing operations. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income was $167,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017 as compared to $169,000 for 2016, resulting in an decrease of $2,000. This decrease was due lower marketable securities balances as we funded our operations. We expect interest income to be lower in 2018 than in 2017, as we continue to use our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our operations. Interest Expense Interest expense was $6,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017. We had no interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2016. The amounts were nominal to our overall operations. Based on our current capital structure, interest expense is expected to be negligible in 2018. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit was $61,000 for the year ended December 31, 2017, related to the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes Act of 2015, or PATH Act, which allows qualified small businesses to monetize up to $250,000 of research and experimentation tax credits through payroll tax refunds. We had no income tax benefit during the year ended December 31, 2016, as the PATH Act refunds were not effective until 2017. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 8,702 $ 7,401 Marketable securities, short and long-term 3,050 16,114 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 11,752 $ 23,515  As of December 31, 2017, we had total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $11.8 million, as compared to $23.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The net decrease of $11.8 million during the year primarily reflects the approximately $17.5 million of cash used to fund operating activities during year ended December 31, 2017, partially offset by $6.1 million of cash proceeds from the sale of common stock. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities Years Ended December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ (17,472 ) $ (14,987 ) Investing activities 12,926 (16,414 ) Financing activities 5,847 - Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,301 $ (31,401 )  Net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 increased approximately $2.5 million compared with the 2016 period. This is primarily due to a higher net loss in 2017, as discussed in more detail above, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2017 was $12.9 million. This is related to $18.4 million of proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, offset by $5.5 million for the purchases of marketable securities and $3,000 for the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016 was $16.4 million. This is related to $20.5 million for the purchases of marketable securities and $12,000 for the purchase of property and equipment, offset by $4.1 million of proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities Net cash provided by financing activities was $5.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2017 representing $6.1 million of net proceeds from our ""at the market"" equity offering executed in January 2017, less $256,000 in payments on a vendor financing arrangement. There was no net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2016. Sources and Uses of Capital Our primary sources of liquidity to date have been capital raised from issuances of shares of our preferred and common stock. The primary uses of our capital resources to date have been to fund operating activities, including research, clinical development and drug manufacturing expenses, license payments, and spending on capital items. In January 2017, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $7.3 million, in an ""at the market offering."" In August 2017, we amended our sales agreement to increase the maximum aggregate value of shares which we may issue and sell from time to time under this sales agreement by approximately $2.9 million, from $7.3 million to $10.2 million. Pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement, as amended, we have sold an aggregate of 4,811,353 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $10.1 million through January 19, 2018. Net proceeds received in the period were approximately $9.5 million, after deducting initial expenses for executing the ""at the market offering"" and commissions paid to the placement agent. Our ability to execute our Gencaro development program in accordance with our projected time line depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: our ability to control costs associated with the clinical trial and our operations; our ability to retain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market; the market price of our stock and the availability and cost of additional equity capital from existing and potential new investors; general economic and industry conditions affecting the availability and cost of capital; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and the terms and conditions of our existing collaborative and licensing agreements. We believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, which includes the $3.4 million of net proceeds raised in January 2018 from sales of our common stock, will be sufficient to fund our operations, at our projected cost structure, through the end of 2018. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our current and forecasted operations could vary materially. We will need to raise additional capital to fund future operations and any additional development of Gencaro or any other product candidates. Such financing would likely result in dilution to our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through the incurrence of indebtedness, the obligations related to such indebtedness would be senior to rights of holders of our capital stock and could contain covenants that would restrict our operations. The significant uncertainties surrounding the clinical development timelines and costs and the ability to raise a significant amount of capital raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern from one year after the Company's financial statements have been issued. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates A critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management's most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. While our significant accounting policies are described in Note 1 of ""Notes to Financial Statements"" included within Item 8 in this report, we believe the following critical accounting policy affected our most significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements and, therefore, is important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations. Accrued Expenses As part of the process of preparing our financial statements, we are required to estimate accrued expenses. This process involves identifying services that third parties have performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for these services as of the balance sheet date. Examples of estimated accrued expenses include contract service fees, such as fees payable to contract manufacturers in connection with the production of materials related to our drug product, and professional service fees, such as attorneys, consultants, and clinical research organizations. We develop estimates of liabilities using our judgment based upon the facts and circumstances known at the time. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We have not participated in any transactions with unconsolidated entities, such as special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off-balance sheet arrangements. Indemnifications In the ordinary course of business, we enter into contractual arrangements under which we may agree to indemnify certain parties from any losses incurred relating to the services they perform on our behalf or for losses arising from certain events as defined within the particular contract. Such indemnification obligations may not be subject to maximum loss clauses. We have entered into indemnity agreements with each of our directors, officers and certain employees. Such indemnity agreements contain provisions, which are in some respects broader than the specific indemnification provisions contained in Delaware law. We also maintain an insurance policy for our directors and executive officers insuring against certain liabilities arising in their capacities as such.

ABIO,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of The terms ""ARCA,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our"" and similar terms refer to ARCA biopharma, Inc. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient through the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Our lead product candidate, Gencaro(TM) (bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that we are developing for the potential treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation, or AF, and chronic heart failure. Reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, or HFrEF, constitutes an estimated 50-60% of the total heart failure, or HF population, with the remainder comprised of HF with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF. We believe that Gencaro's efficacy is enhanced in a specific genotype that is present in approximately fifty percent of the general population in the United States, and can be identified by a genetic test. We believe that with this genetic test, we may be able to predict individual patient response to Gencaro, potentially improving the efficacy of treatment for AF in HFrEF patients with this particular genotype. We believe that Gencaro, if approved, could potentially be a safer and more effective therapy for treating or preventing AF in patients with HFrEF and could be the first genetically-targeted AF treatment. We also believe that Gencaro may have market exclusivity based on patents and new chemical entity status, if approved in the United States, Europe or other markets. We are conducting a Phase 2B/Phase 3 clinical superiority trial, known as GENETIC-AF, in which we are evaluating Gencaro for the treatment and prevention of AF in patients with HFrEF. In our trial, HFrEF is defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, of less than 50%. GENETIC-AF compares Gencaro to TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), a drug approved for treating HFrEF that is also prescribed, but not approved, for treating AF in patients with HFrEF. Enrollment in GENETIC-AF is limited to patients that possess the specific genotype that we believe enhances Gencaro's potential therapeutic effects. Our current development of Gencaro is, in part, based on a prospectively designed DNA substudy of adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in the BEST trial, a previous Phase 3 study of 2,708 HF patients. Based on data from the BEST trial, Gencaro showed potential evidence of enhanced efficacy in treating AF and in reducing mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients with this specific genotype. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, designated the investigation of Gencaro for the prevention of AF in a genetically targeted heart failure population (HF patients with reduced LVEF) as a Fast Track development program. AF, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is a potentially serious disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart's two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular, rapid and uncoordinated. AF commonly occurs together with HFrEF, with AF being both a cause and a result of HFrEF. By increasing heart rate and producing irregular cycle lengths, AF may contribute to the disease processes that leads to the progression of HFrEF and worsening clinical outcomes. AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease and a major public health burden. The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2010 was 33.5 million. According to the 2017 American Heart Association report on Cardiovascular Disease, approximately 5.2 million people in the United States had atrial fibrillation in 2015. Hospitalization rates for AF increased by 23% among U.S. adults from 2000 to 2010 and hospitalizations account for the majority of the economic cost burden associated with AF. In a global registry of AF patients, the rates of heart failure (of all types) ranged from 33% in patients with paroxysmal (episodes lasting 7 days or less) to 56% in patients with permanent AF. We believe there is a significant need for drug therapies that are safe and effective for HFrEF patients with AF, as the existing drug therapies for the treatment or prevention AF have certain safety disadvantages in HFrEF patients, such as toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects. Most of the approved drugs for AF are contra indicated or have warnings in their prescribing information for such patients. Consequently, in the treatment and prevention of AF in HFrEF patients, we believe there is an unmet medical need for new treatments that have fewer side effects and are more effective than currently available therapies. We believe that data from the BEST trial indicate that Gencaro may have a genetically regulated effect in reducing or preventing AF in HFrEF patients. A retrospective analysis of data from the BEST trial shows that all patients in the trial treated with Gencaro had a 41% reduction in the risk of new onset AF (time-to-event) compared to placebo (p = 0.0004). In a substudy in the trial, which considered only patients with the genotype believed to enhance Gencaro's efficacy (known as the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype), patients treated with Gencaro experienced a 74% (p = 0.0003) reduction in risk of AF, based on the same analysis. In addition, the BEST study, the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype Gencaro demonstrated enhanced efficacy in reducing mortality, hospitalizations, and ventricular tachycardia /ventricular fibrillation, or VT/VF. Furthermore, patients with a beta�1 389 arginine homozygous genotype who entered the trial in AF had statistically significant reductions in major cardiovascular or HF mortality/hospitalization composite endpoints, which we believe is the first and thus far only demonstration of effectiveness of a beta-blocker in reducing major HF events in HFrEF patients with permanent AF. We believe that in HFrEF patients, the therapeutic efficacy of TOPROL-XL is not enhanced in patients with a beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype, and we believe that Gencaro may be potentially unique in the beta-blocker class of drugs due to its apparent pharmacologic interaction with this beta-1 adrenergic receptor polymorphism. The beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype was present in about 47% of the patients in the BEST pharmacogenetic substudy, and we estimate it is present in about 50% of the U.S. general population. GENETIC-AF is an adaptive, seamless design Phase 2B/Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro against an active comparator, the beta-blocker TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), that seeks to enroll a combined total of approximately 620 patients. Eligible patients will have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro. A subset of patients in the trial will also undergo continuous heart rhythm monitoring to assess AF burden, which is defined as the amount of time per day that a patient experiences AF. These data will be collected via newly or previously implanted Medtronic, Inc. devices capable of assessing AF burden (for example, implantable loop recorders, pacemakers, cardioverter-defibrillators, or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices). The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of symptomatic AF/atrial flutter, or AFL, or all-cause mortality. The combined Phase 2B/Phase 3 trial is designed for 90 percent power at a p-value of less than 0.01 significance level to detect a 25 percent reduction in the primary endpoint for patients in the Gencaro arm compared to patients in the TOPROL-XL arm. We received guidance from the FDA regarding the GENETIC-AF clinical trial prior to initiation of the trial. Based on this FDA guidance, we believe that a successful GENETIC-AF Phase 3 clinical trial, with a p-value of less than or equal to 0.01 could be sufficient evidence of efficacy upon which to base a New Drug Application, or NDA, when submitted with the prior Phase 3 BEST trial data, for the approval of Gencaro for an AF indication in HFrEF patients. A second trial may be required if the GENETIC-AF trial results produce a p-value greater than 0.01. The trial is currently enrolling patients in the United States, Canada and Europe. The GENETIC-AF Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, will perform a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy data. The primary analysis will be conducted for detection of evidence of safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, TOPROL-XL. The prospectively defined features of this analysis include an estimate of Gencaro effectiveness relative to TOPROL-XL and an assessment of safety as characterized by adverse events. The primary analysis method will generate predictive probability of success, or PPoS, values that will be compared to prespecified PPoS boundaries constructed from Bayesian statistical modeling. Prospectively defined PPoS ranges have been predetermined to define three potential outcomes based on the projection of the Phase 2B interim results: 1) transition the trial to Phase 3 based on a likelihood of achieving a statistically significant hazard ratio in favor of Gencaro (evidence of an efficacy signal consistent with pretrial assumptions) and enroll up to a total of 620 patients (including the Phase 2B patients); 2) completion of the Phase 2B stage of the trial including 24-week follow-up of all randomized subjects, based on an intermediate result that is potentially favorable but does not support transition of the trial to Phase 3 or; 3) immediate termination of the trial due to futility, if the PPoS results fall below the boundary for completion as a Phase 2 trial. We, in collaboration with the GENETIC-AF Steering Committee, will determine the next steps for the trial based on the DSMB recommendation from this interim analysis and on our available capital. The unblinded statistical data available to the DSMB will not be disclosed to us or the public. We project that the outcome of the DSMB interim analysis and recommendation will be available in August 2017. In February 2016, we amended the trial protocol to allow for up to 250 patients to be enrolled in the Phase 2B portion of the trial, which has enabled the study to continue enrolling patients while the data is being prepared for the DSMB interim analysis. Should the DSMB recommend that the study transition to Phase 3, the trial would continue enrolling to a total of approximately 620 patients (i.e., approximately 250 patients in Phase 2B and 370 patients in Phase 3), subject to our obtaining sufficient financing to fund the Phase 3 portion of the trial. In February 2016, the GENETIC-AF protocol was amended to simplify certain operational aspects of the trial. We believe these modifications facilitated site recruitment and enrollment in existing trial sites and additional sites in European countries, where we are expanding the study to support both the latter portion of Phase 2B, as well as the potential Phase 3 portion of the trial. We believe inclusion of European investigative sites will also support potential European regulatory submissions and partnering activity. We received no objections from the FDA and Health Canada on the protocol amendments prior to their implementation. As such, we believe that these changes do not fundamentally alter or impact previous regulatory agreements. Our GENETIC-AF clinical trial of Gencaro requires a companion diagnostic test to identify the patient's receptor genotype. We have an agreement with Laboratory Corporation of America, or LabCorp, to provide the companion diagnostic test and services to support our GENETIC-AF trial. LabCorp has developed the genetic test and obtained an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, from the FDA for the companion diagnostic test which is being used in our GENETIC�AF clinical trial. We retain all rights to the genetic test. Medtronic, Inc., or Medtronic, a global healthcare solutions company, is collaborating with us on the GENETIC-AF trial. Under the collaboration with Medtronic, ARCA is conducting a substudy that includes continuous monitoring of the cardiac rhythms in a subset of patients enrolled during the trial, which is the basis for a supportive endpoint in the trial known as AF burden. The collaboration is administered by a joint ARCA-Medtronic committee. Medtronic uses its proprietary CareLink System to collect and analyze the cardiac rhythm data from the implanted Medtronic devices and the data will be used by the DSMB as part of the interim analysis. Medtronic will support the reimbursement process for U.S. patients enrolled in the Phase 2B portion, and will provide financial support of unreimbursed costs for a certain number of U.S. patients in the Phase 2B portion up to a certain maximum amount per patient. If GENETIC-AF transitions to Phase 3, we will continue to enroll additional patients, with Medtronic devices for monitoring and recording AF burden, in the substudy. Medtronic will provide the agreed upon CareLink System cardiac rhythm data collection and analysis for the Phase 3 portion of the substudy and support the reimbursement process. We have been granted patents in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions for methods of treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro based on genetic testing. We believe our patent portfolio and new chemical entity exclusivity may provide market exclusivity for the indications of Gencaro that we may develop, into approximately 2030 or 2031 in the United States, Europe and other markets. To date, we have randomized more than 250 HFrEF patients in the Phase 2B portion of the GENETIC-AF trial, and we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations, at our projected cost structure, through the end of 2017. In January 2017, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $7.3 million, in an ""at the market offering."" As of July 31, 2017, we have sold an aggregate of 2,653,440 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.5 million. Net proceeds received in the period were approximately $6.1 million, including initial expenses for executing the ""at the market offering"" and commissions to the placement agent. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently anticipate. If we transition to the Phase 3 portion of GENETIC-AF, we will be required to raise additional funds. Results of Operations Research and Development Expenses Research and development, or R&D, expense is comprised primarily of clinical development, manufacturing process development, and regulatory activities and costs. Our R&D expense continues to be almost entirely generated by our activities relating to the development of Gencaro. R&D expense for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $4.5 million compared to $2.9 million for the corresponding period of 2016, an increase of approximately $1.6 million. R&D expense for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $7.8 million compared to $5.5 million for the corresponding period of 2016, an increase of approximately $2.2 million. The increase in our R&D expense in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was due primarily to the increased expense of our GENETIC�AF clinical trial. Clinical expense increased approximately $1.0 million for the three months and $2.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2016. The cost increases in the three and six month periods was primarily due to clinical trial cost activities, as well as increased personnel costs. The increase in costs were related to our GENETIC-AF clinical trial, including contract research organization, or CRO, costs, clinical site initiation and monitoring activities, patient visit costs and increased costs to support expanding into Europe. Manufacturing process development costs increased approximately $520,000 for the three months and were relatively unchanged for the six months ended June 30, 2017, as compared to the corresponding periods of 2016. The increase was a result of production of clinical trial materials to be used in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. We expect R&D expense in 2017 to be higher than 2016 as we activate new clinical sites and enroll additional patients in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses, or G&A, primarily consist of personnel costs, consulting and professional fees, insurance, facilities and depreciation expenses, and various other administrative costs. G&A expense was $1.1 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $1.0 million for the corresponding period of 2016, a net increase of $23,000. G&A expense was $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $2.1 million for the corresponding period in 2016, a net increase of $84,000. The increase for the three and six month periods was comprised primarily of higher consulting costs and professional fees. These increases were partially offset by decreased non-cash, stock-based compensation expense in 2017, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016. G&A expenses in 2017 are expected to be higher than in 2016 as we increase administrative activities to support our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income was $39,000 and $47,000 in the three months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Interest and other income was $84,000 and $68,000 in the six months ended June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect interest income to be lower in 2017 than in 2016, as we continue to use our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our operations. Interest Expense Interest expense was $2,000 and $4,000 in the three and six months ended June 30, 2017. We had no interest expense in the three and six months ended June 30, 2016. Based on our current capital structure, interest expense for the remainder of 2017 is expected to be negligible. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities June 30, December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 9,101 $ 7,401 Marketable securities, short and long-term 6,906 16,114 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 16,007 $ 23,515  As of June 30, 2017, we had total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of $16.0 million, as compared to $23.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The net decrease of $7.5 million in the six months ended June 30, 2017 reflects the $9.3 million of cash used to fund operating activities during the six months ended June 30, 2017, offset by net proceeds of $2.1 million from equity sales. Subsequent to June 30, 2017, we sold an aggregate of 1,634,158 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $4.0 million. Net proceeds subsequent to June 30, 2017 were approximately $3.9 million, including expenses for executing the ""at the market offering"" and commissions to the placement agent. As of July 25, 2017, we have sold all shares available under the prospectus to our registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-217459) and do not currently anticipate making any additional sales under this facility. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities Six Months Ended June 30, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ (9,302 ) $ (7,409 ) Investing activities 9,109 (17,014 ) Financing activities 1,893 - Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 1,700 $ (24,423 )  Net cash used in operating activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 increased $1.9 million compared with the same period in 2016. This was primarily due to higher outflows related to a higher net loss in 2017, as discussed in more detail above, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $9.1 million, consisting of $11.2 million of proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, offset by $2.0 million for the purchase of marketable securities and $2,000 for the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash used in investing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016 was $17.0 million. This consisted of $17.5 million for the purchases of marketable securities and $2,000 for the purchase of property and equipment, offset by $450,000 of proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $1.9 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 representing $2.1 million of net proceeds from our ""at the market"" equity offering executed in January 2017, less approximately $170,000 in payments on a vendor financing arrangement. There was no net cash provided by financing activities for the six months ended June 30, 2016. Sources and Uses of Capital Our primary sources of liquidity to date have been capital raised from issuances of shares of our preferred and common stock. The primary uses of our capital resources to date have been to fund operating activities, including research, clinical development and drug manufacturing expenses, license payments, and spending on capital items. In January 2017, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $7.3 million, in an ""at the market offering."" As of July 25, 2017, we have sold all shares available under the prospectus to our registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-217459) and do not currently anticipate making any additional sales under this facility. Pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement, we have sold an aggregate of 2,653,440 shares of our common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $6.5 million. Net proceeds received were approximately $6.1 million, including initial expenses for executing the ""at the market offering"" and commissions to the placement agent. We initiated our GENETIC-AF Phase 2B/3 clinical trial during 2014. Our ability to execute our GENETIC-AF Phase 2B trial in accordance with our projected time line depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: the outcome of the DSMB interim analysis and recommendation. The DSMB may recommend that the trial transition to Phase 3, the trial be completed as a Phase 2B study, or termination of the trial due to futility; recruitment of sufficient clinical trial sites, enrollment of patients and enrollment at a rate consistent with our projected timeline; effects of protocol amendments and their projected impact on enrollment; our ability to control costs associated with the clinical trial and our operations; our ability to retain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market; the market price of our stock and the availability and cost of additional equity capital from existing and potential new investors; general economic and industry conditions affecting the availability and cost of capital; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and the terms and conditions of our existing collaborative and licensing agreements. In order to increase the pool of patients eligible for enrollment in GENETIC-AF, consistent with the adaptive design nature of the trial, we consulted with the GENETIC-AF Steering Committee and implemented amendments to the trial protocol in March 2015 and February 2016. In March 2015, the GENETIC-AF protocol was . . . Aug 03, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

ABIO,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS This Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains ""forward-looking statements"" within the meaning of The terms ""ARCA,"" ""we,"" ""us,"" ""our"" and similar terms refer to ARCA biopharma, Inc. Overview We are a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases. Precision medicine refers to the tailoring of medical treatment to the individual characteristics of each patient through the ability to classify individuals into subpopulations that differ in their susceptibility to a particular disease, in the biology and/or prognosis of those diseases they may develop, or in their response to a specific treatment. Our lead product candidate, Gencaro(TM) (bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator that we are developing for the potential treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation, or AF, and chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, or HFrEF. HFrEF constitutes an estimated 50-60% of the total heart failure, or HF population, with the remainder comprised of HF with preserved ejection fraction, or HFpEF. We believe that Gencaro's efficacy is enhanced in a specific genotype that is present in approximately fifty percent of the general population in the United States, and can be identified by a genetic test. We believe that with this genetic test, we may be able to predict individual patient response to Gencaro, potentially improving the efficacy of treatment for AF in HFrEF patients with this particular genotype. We believe that Gencaro, if approved, could potentially be a safer and more effective therapy for treating or preventing AF in patients with HFrEF and could be the first genetically-targeted AF treatment. We also believe that Gencaro may have market exclusivity based on patents and new chemical entity status, if approved in the United States, Europe or other markets. We are conducting a Phase 2B/Phase 3 clinical superiority trial, known as GENETIC-AF, in which we are evaluating Gencaro for the treatment and prevention of AF in HFrEF patients. In our trial, HFrEF is defined as a left ventricular ejection fraction, or LVEF, of less than 50%. GENETIC-AF compares Gencaro to TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), a drug approved for treating HFrEF that is also prescribed, but not approved, for treating AF in patients with HFrEF. Enrollment in GENETIC-AF is limited to patients that possess the specific genotype that we believe enhances Gencaro's potential therapeutic effects. Our current development of Gencaro is, in part, based on a prospectively designed DNA substudy of adrenergic receptor polymorphisms in the BEST trial, a previous Phase 3 study of 2,708 HF patients. Based on data from the BEST trial, Gencaro showed potential evidence of enhanced efficacy in treating AF and in reducing mortality and hospitalizations in HF patients with this specific genotype. In 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, designated the investigation of Gencaro for the prevention of AF in a genetically targeted heart failure population (HF patients with reduced LVEF) as a Fast Track development program. AF, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is a potentially serious disorder in which the normally regular and coordinated contraction pattern of the heart's two small upper chambers, or the atria, becomes irregular, rapid and uncoordinated. AF commonly occurs together with HFrEF, with AF being both a cause and a result of HFrEF. By increasing heart rate and producing irregular cycle lengths, AF may contribute to the disease processes that leads to the progression of HFrEF and worsening clinical outcomes. AF is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease and a major public health burden. The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2010 was 33.5 million. According to the 2017 American Heart Association report on Cardiovascular Disease, approximately 5.2 million people in the United States had atrial fibrillation in 2015. Hospitalization rates for AF increased by 23% among U.S. adults from 2000 to 2010 and hospitalizations account for the majority of the economic cost burden associated with AF. In a global registry of AF patients, the rates of heart failure (of all types) ranged from 33% in patients with paroxysmal (episodes lasting 7 days or less) to 56% in patients with permanent AF. We believe there is a significant need for drug therapies that are safe and effective for HFrEF patients with AF, as the existing drug therapies for the treatment or prevention AF have certain safety disadvantages in HFrEF patients, such as toxic or cardiovascular adverse effects. Most of the approved drugs for AF are contra indicated or have warnings in their prescribing information for such patients. Consequently, in the treatment and prevention of AF in HFrEF patients, we believe there is an unmet medical need for new treatments that have fewer side effects and are more effective than currently available therapies. We believe that data from the BEST trial indicate that Gencaro may have a genetically regulated effect in reducing or preventing AF in HFrEF patients. A retrospective analysis of data from the BEST trial shows that all patients in the trial treated with Gencaro had a 41% reduction in the risk of new onset AF (time-to-event) compared to placebo (p = 0.0004). In a substudy in the trial, which considered only patients with the genotype believed to enhance Gencaro's efficacy (known as the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype), patients treated with Gencaro experienced a 74% (p = 0.0003) reduction in risk of AF, based on the same analysis. In addition, the BEST study, the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype Gencaro demonstrated enhanced efficacy in reducing mortality, hospitalizations, and ventricular tachycardia /ventricular fibrillation, or VT/VF. Furthermore, patients with a beta�1 389 arginine homozygous genotype who entered the trial in AF had statistically significant reductions in major cardiovascular or HF mortality/hospitalization composite endpoints, which we believe is the first and thus far only demonstration of effectiveness of a beta-blocker in reducing major HF events in HFrEF patients with permanent AF. We believe that in HFrEF patients, the therapeutic efficacy of TOPROL-XL is not enhanced in patients with a beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype, and we believe that Gencaro may be potentially unique in the beta-blocker class of drugs due to its apparent pharmacologic interaction with this beta-1 adrenergic receptor polymorphism. The beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype was present in about 47% of the patients in the BEST pharmacogenetic substudy, and we estimate it is present in about 50% of the U.S. general population. GENETIC-AF is an adaptive, seamless design Phase 2B/Phase 3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro against an active comparator, the beta-blocker TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate), that seeks to enroll a combined total of approximately 620 patients. Eligible patients will have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that we believe responds most favorably to Gencaro. A subset of patients in the trial will also undergo continuous heart rhythm monitoring to assess AF burden, which is defined as the amount of time per day that a patient experiences AF. These data will be collected via newly or previously implanted Medtronic, Inc. devices capable of assessing AF burden (for example, implantable loop recorders, pacemakers, cardioverter-defibrillators, or cardiac resynchronization therapy devices). The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of symptomatic AF/atrial flutter, or AFL, or all-cause mortality. The combined Phase 2B/Phase 3 trial is designed for 90 percent power at a p-value of less than 0.01 significance level to detect a 25 percent reduction in the primary endpoint for patients in the Gencaro arm compared to patients in the TOPROL-XL arm. We received guidance from the FDA regarding the GENETIC-AF clinical trial prior to initiation of the trial. Based on this FDA guidance, we believe that a successful GENETIC-AF Phase 3 clinical trial, with a p-value of less than or equal to 0.01 could be sufficient evidence of efficacy upon which to base a New Drug Application, or NDA, when submitted with the prior Phase 3 BEST trial data, for the approval of Gencaro for an AF indication in HFrEF patients. A second trial may be required if the GENETIC-AF trial results produce a p-value greater than 0.01. The trial is currently enrolling patients in the United States, Canada and Europe. The GENETIC-AF Data and Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, will perform a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy data when at least 150 patients have evaluable data. A randomized patient has evaluable data either when they experience their first composite endpoint event, AF/AFL or all-cause mortality, or after completion of the 24-week primary endpoint follow-up period. The analysis will be conducted for detection of evidence of safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, TOPROL-XL. The prospectively defined features of this analysis include an estimate of Gencaro effectiveness relative to TOPROL-XL and an assessment of safety as characterized by adverse events. The relative benefit estimate will utilize Bayesian statistical methods to calculate the predictive probability of the Phase 3 patient cohort hazard ratio based on the interim Phase 2B data. Prospectively defined ranges of predictive probabilities have been predetermined to define three potential outcomes based on the projection of the Phase 2B interim results: 1) transition the trial to Phase 3 based on a likelihood of achieving a statistically significant hazard ratio in favor of Gencaro (evidence of an efficacy signal consistent with pretrial assumptions) and enroll up to a total of 620 patients (including the Phase 2B patients); 2) completion of the Phase 2B stage of the trial including 24-week follow-up of all randomized subjects (approximately 250 patients), based on an intermediate result that is potentially favorable but does not support transition of the trial to Phase 3 or; 3) immediate termination of the trial due to futility. We, in collaboration with the GENETIC-AF Steering Committee, will determine the next steps for the trial based on the DSMB recommendation from this interim analysis and on our available capital. The unblinded statistical data available to the DSMB will not be disclosed to us or the public. We randomized our 200th patient in the trial in April 2017. We project that the outcome of the DSMB interim analysis and recommendation will be available in September 2017. In February 2016, we amended the trial protocol to allow for up to 250 patients to be enrolled in the Phase 2B portion of the trial, which is intended to enable the study to continue enrolling patients while the DSMB interim analysis is underway. Should the DSMB recommend that the study continue to Phase 3, the trial would continue enrolling to a total of approximately 620 patients (i.e., up to 250 patients in Phase 2B and 370 patients in Phase 3), subject to our obtaining sufficient financing to fund the Phase 3 portion of the trial. In February 2016, the GENETIC-AF protocol was amended to simplify certain operational aspects of the trial. We believe these modifications facilitated site recruitment and enrollment in existing trial sites and additional sites in European countries, where we are expanding the study to support both the latter portion of Phase 2B, as well as the potential Phase 3 portion of the trial. We believe inclusion of European investigative sites will also support potential European regulatory submissions and partnering activity. We received no objections from the FDA and Health Canada on the protocol amendments prior to their implementation. As such, we believe that these changes do not fundamentally alter or impact previous regulatory agreements. Our GENETIC-AF clinical trial of Gencaro requires a companion diagnostic test to identify the patient's receptor genotype. We have an agreement with Laboratory Corporation of America, or LabCorp, to provide the companion diagnostic test and services to support our GENETIC-AF trial. LabCorp has developed the genetic test and obtained an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, from the FDA for the companion diagnostic test which is being used in our GENETIC�AF clinical trial. We retain all rights to the genetic test. Medtronic, Inc., or Medtronic, a global healthcare solutions company, is collaborating with us on the GENETIC-AF trial. Under the collaboration with Medtronic, ARCA is conducting a substudy that includes continuous monitoring of the cardiac rhythms in a subset of patients enrolled during the trial, which is the basis for a supportive endpoint in the trial known as AF burden. The collaboration is administered by a joint ARCA-Medtronic committee. Medtronic uses its proprietary CareLink System to collect and analyze the cardiac rhythm data from the implanted Medtronic devices and the data will be used by the DSMB as part of the interim analysis. Medtronic will support the reimbursement process for U.S. patients enrolled in the Phase 2B portion, and will provide financial support of unreimbursed costs for a certain number of U.S. patients in the Phase 2B portion up to a certain maximum amount per patient. If GENETIC-AF continues to Phase 3, we will continue to enroll additional patients, with Medtronic devices for monitoring and recording AF burden, in the substudy. Medtronic will provide the agreed upon CareLink System cardiac rhythm data collection and analysis for the Phase 3 portion of the substudy and support the reimbursement process. We have been granted patents in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions for methods of treating AF and HF patients with Gencaro based on genetic testing. We believe our patent portfolio and new chemical entity exclusivity may provide market exclusivity for the indications of Gencaro that we may develop, into approximately 2030 or 2031 in the United States, Europe and other markets. We are seeking to enroll up to 250 HFrEF patients in the Phase 2B portion of the GENETIC-AF trial, and we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations, at our projected cost structure, through the end of 2017. In January 2017, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $7.3 million, in an ""at the market offering."" As of March 31, 2017, we have sold an aggregate of 85,068 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $221,000. Net proceeds received in the period were approximately $69,000, including initial expenses for executing the ""at the market offering"" and commissions to the placement agent. However, changing circumstances may cause us to consume capital significantly faster or slower than we currently anticipate. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could exhaust our available financial resources sooner than we currently anticipate. If we continue to the Phase 3 portion of GENETIC-AF, we will be required to raise additional funds. Results of Operations Research and Development Expenses Research and development, or R&D, expense is comprised primarily of clinical development, manufacturing process development, and regulatory activities and costs. Our R&D expense continues to be almost entirely generated by our activities relating to the development of Gencaro. R&D expense for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $3.2 million compared to $2.6 million for the corresponding period of 2016, an increase of approximately $0.7 million. The increase in our R&D expense in the three month period ended March 31, 2017 was due primarily to the increased expense of our GENETIC�AF clinical trial. Clinical expense increased approximately $1.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017, as compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The cost increases in the three month period is primarily due to clinical trial cost activities, as well as increased personnel costs. The increase in costs were related to our GENETIC-AF clinical trial, including contract research organization, or CRO, costs, clinical site initiation and monitoring activities, patient visit costs and increased costs to support expanding into Europe. Manufacturing process development costs decreased approximately $485,000 for the three month period ended March 31, 2017 compared to the corresponding period of 2016. The decrease was a result of 2016 production of clinical trial materials to be used in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial, with no corresponding 2017 activity. We expect R&D expense in 2017 to be higher than 2016 as we activate new clinical sites and enroll additional patients in our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses, or G&A, primarily consist of personnel costs, consulting and professional fees, insurance, facilities and depreciation expenses, and various other administrative costs. G&A expense was $1.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 as compared to $1.1 million for the corresponding period in 2016, a net increase of approximately $60,000. The increase for the three month period is comprised primarily of higher consulting costs. This increase is partially offset by decreased non-cash, stock-based compensation expense in 2017, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016. G&A expenses in 2017 are expected to be higher than in 2016 as we increase administrative activities to support our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. Interest and Other Income Interest and other income was $45,000 and $21,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect interest income to be lower in 2017 than in 2016, as we continue to use our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our operations. Interest Expense Interest expense was $2,000 in the three months ended March 31, 2017. We had no interest expense in the three month period ended March 31, 2016. Based on our current capital structure, interest expense for the remainder of 2017 is expected to be negligible. Liquidity and Capital Resources Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities March 31, December 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Cash and cash equivalents $ 6,170 $ 7,401 Marketable securities, short and long-term 13,041 16,114 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 19,211 $ 23,515  As of March 31, 2017, we had total cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately $19.2 million, as compared to $23.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The net decrease of $4.3 million in the three month period reflects the approximately $4.3 million of cash used to fund operating activities during the three months ended March 31, 2017. Cash Flows from Operating, Investing and Financing Activities Three Months Ended March 31, 2017 2016 (in thousands) Net cash (used in) provided by: Operating activities $ (4,344 ) $ (3,883 ) Investing activities 3,008 (5,202 ) Financing activities 105 - Net decrease in cash and cash equivalents $ (1,231 ) $ (9,085 )  Net cash used in operating activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 increased approximately $0.5 million compared with the same period in 2016. This is primarily due to higher outflows related to a higher net loss in 2017, as discussed in more detail above, offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. Net cash provided by investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $3.0 million, consisting of $4.6 million of proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities, offset by $1.5 million for the purchase of marketable securities. Net cash used in investing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016 was $5.2 million for the purchases of marketable securities and $1,000 for the purchase of property and equipment. Net cash provided by financing activities was $0.1 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 representing approximately $0.1 million of net proceeds from our ""at the market"" offering executed in January 2017. There was no net cash provided by financing activities for the three months ended March 31, 2016. Sources and Uses of Capital Our primary sources of liquidity to date have been capital raised from issuances of shares of our preferred and common stock. The primary uses of our capital resources to date have been to fund operating activities, including research, clinical development and drug manufacturing expenses, license payments, and spending on capital items. In January 2017, we entered into a sales agreement with an agent to sell, from time to time, our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $7.3 million, in an ""at the market offering."" As of March 31, 2017, we have sold an aggregate of 85,068 shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of such sales agreement for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $221,000. Net proceeds received in the period were approximately $69,000, including initial expenses for executing the ""at the market offering"" and commissions to the placement agent. We initiated our GENETIC-AF Phase 2B/3 clinical trial during 2014. Our ability to execute our GENETIC-AF Phase 2B trial in accordance with our projected time line depends on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the following: recruitment of sufficient clinical trial sites, enrollment of patients and enrollment at a rate consistent with our projected timeline; effects of protocol amendments and their projected impact on enrollment; our ability to control costs associated with the clinical trial and our operations; our ability to retain the listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Capital Market; the market price of our stock and the availability and cost of additional equity capital from existing and potential new investors; general economic and industry conditions affecting the availability and cost of capital; the costs of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights; and the terms and conditions of our existing collaborative and licensing agreements. In order to increase the pool of patients eligible for enrollment in GENETIC-AF, consistent with the adaptive design nature of the trial, we consulted with the GENETIC-AF Steering Committee and implemented amendments to the trial protocol in March 2015 and February 2016. In March 2015, the GENETIC-AF protocol was revised to expand the target study population. Previously, the protocol required patients to have persistent AF at the time of screening to be eligible. Under the revised protocol, patients in sinus rhythm who have experienced symptomatic AF are eligible for inclusion in the trial, as are patients with paroxysmal AF. We believe this expanded target population has improved trial screening and enrollment rates and could broaden the potential commercial market for Gencaro, should it achieve regulatory approval in the future. In February 2016, the GENETIC-AF protocol was amended to simplify certain operational aspects of the trial. We believe these modifications have and will facilitate site recruitment and enrollment in existing trial sites and additional sites in European countries, where we are expanding the study to support both the latter portion of Phase 2B, as well as the potential Phase 3 portion of the trial. We believe inclusion of European investigative sites will also support potential European regulatory submissions and partnering activity. We randomized our 200th patient in the trial in April 2017. We project that the outcome of the DSMB interim analysis and recommendation will be available in September 2017. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our operations, at our projected cost structure, through the end of 2017. However, our forecast of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our current and forecasted operations could vary materially.

ABIO,"WESTMINSTER, Colo., Mar 22, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- ARCA biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71% a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases, today reported financial results for the year ended December 31, 2017. ""During 2017, we continued to make progress on our lead development program as we completed the GENETIC-AF clinical trial evaluating Gencaro as potentially the first genetically-targeted treatment for atrial fibrillation,"" commented Dr. Michael Bristow, ARCA's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We reported top-line Phase 2B results for the GENETIC-AF clinical trial in February 2018 and are requesting a meeting with the U.S. FDA for the second quarter of 2018 to review the data and future development plans."" 2017 Summary Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $11.8 million as of December 31, 2017, compared to $23.5 million as of December 31, 2016. The Company raised net proceeds of approximately $3.4 million in January 2018 from sales of its common stock under its ""at-the-market"" offering facility. ARCA believes that its current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operations, at its projected cost structure, through the end of 2018. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 totaled $14.1 million compared to $12.3 million for 2016. The $1.7 million increase in research and development expenses in 2017 as compared to 2016 was primarily due to increased expenses for the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. The Company expects R&D expenses in 2018 to be lower than 2017 as the GENETIC-AF clinical trial has been completed. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $4.6 million compared to $4.3 million in 2016. ARCA expects G&A expenses in 2018 to be consistent with those in 2017 as it maintains administrative activities to support ongoing operations. Total operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2017 were $18.7 million compared to $16.6 million in 2016. The increase in total operating expenses for 2017 was primarily due to the increase in R&D expense due to the increased expense of the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. Net loss was $18.5 million, or $1.77 per share, for 2017 compared to $16.4 million, or $1.81 per share, for 2016. About ARCA biopharma ARCA biopharma is dedicated to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases through a precision medicine approach to drug development. ARCA's lead product candidate, Gencaro [TM] (bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator being developed for the potential treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and chronic heart failure with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF) which recently completed a Phase 2B clinical trial. ARCA has identified common genetic variations that it believes predict individual patient response to Gencaro, giving it the potential to be the first genetically-targeted AF prevention treatment. ARCA has a collaboration with Medtronic, Inc. for support of the GENETIC-AF trial. The Gencaro development program has been granted Fast Track designation by FDA. ARCA also plans to develop AB171, a thiol-substituted isosorbide mononitrate, as a potential genetically-targeted treatment for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and for heart failure (HF).

ABIO,"LAS VEGAS, March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- LAS VEGAS, March 20, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- FN Media Group Presents Microcapspeculators.com News Commentary  The healthcare sector has always been one of the best performing industries in the stock market over the last several decades. In fact, since 1963 the healthcare sector has generated an annualized rate of return of 11 percent. Included in today's commentary: Endonovo Therapeutics, Inc. ENDV, +6.25% Athersys, Inc. ATHX, +0.00% Caladrius Biosciences CLBS, +4.12% ARCA Biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71% Geron Corporation GERN, +0.47% Over the last decade, the S&P 500 biotechnology sub-industry index has risen 344%, compared to a 102% increase for the overall index as of this month, according to an article on Morningstar. However, over the past three years, the sector has taken a big hit due in part to the extraordinary returns the sector generated over the last few years leading to high valuations and profit-taking from some investors. Conversely, two factors probably had an even bigger impact on the sector: politics and drug development cycles. With a more business-friendly administration in office, the fear of drug prices being capped and significant changes occurring to the healthcare system has largely waned. At the same time, the drug cycle that fuel biotech stocks to new heights over the last few years ended. According to Eddie Yoon, manager of Fidelity Select Health Care, new medicines were only beginning to materialize in 2012 and 2013, and only began generating revenues in 2015 and 2016. Simply put, the biotech sector tends to move in cycles and is fueled by new medicines hitting the market and then generating significant revenues, i.e. the hepatitis C medicines and immunotherapies. Over the last couple of years, the sector has had to reignite its fire and begin to gain momentum as new promising therapies approach the market. These new revolutionary medicines include cell therapies, where living cells, such as stem cells, are injected into patients to treat diseases like heart failure. In one case a completely new field of medicine has emerged, called bioelectronic medicine, which seeks to treat diseases by stimulating nerves and tissues to using electrical signals to reduce inflammation and promote healing. A few biotech companies in the news that could benefit from a resurgent biotech sector include: Endonovo Therapeutics, Inc. (otcqb:ENDV), Athersys, Inc. ATHX, +0.00% Caladrius Biosciences CLBS, +4.12% ARCA Biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71% Geron Corporation GERN, +0.47% Endonovo Therapeutics, Inc. (otcqb:ENDV)  Market Cap: $11.4M, current share price: $0.037  ENDV, a commercial-stage developer of Electroceutical™ Therapies targeting inflammatory conditions, cardiovascular diseases and neurological disorders recently announced that it has begun commercial sales of its FDA-Cleared Electroceutical™ Therapy for the palliative treatment of pain and post-surgical edema (swelling). Endonovo is seeking to expand the use of its Electroceutical™ Therapy to treat cardiovascular diseases such as end-stage ischemic heart disease and neurological disorders, such as traumatic brain injury, multiple sclerosis and stroke. ENDV's Electroceutical™ Therapy works by increasing the production of endothelial nitric oxide. Nitric Oxide (NO) acts as a messenger in diverse functions, such as vasodilatation, neurotransmission, and anti-pathogenic activities. Sufficient levels of NO production are necessary in protecting an organ such as the heart, brain, or liver from ischemic damage. NO dilates blood vessels, raising blood supply and lowering blood pressure. In 1992, for its importance in neuroscience, physiology, and immunology, nitric oxide was proclaimed the ""Molecule of the Year"". The 1998 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine was awarded for discovering nitric oxide's role as a cardiovascular signaling molecule. ENDV's Electroceutical™ Therapy has demonstrated extremely promising clinical data in ""no option"" patients with end-stage ischemic heart disease, and Endonovo is now seeking to start a much larger clinical trial to demonstrate efficacy and file for FDA Approval. A truly innovative, non-invasive platform technology for treating cardiovascular and neurological diseases and market-ready products makes ENDV a huge bargain at its current price. Caladrius Biosciences, Inc. CLBS, +4.12%   Market Cap: $54.7M, current share price: $5.78  CLBS recently announced that it had acquired a late-stage stem cell therapy from Shire (SHPG) under a licensing deal. Under the licensing deal, Caladrius will pay an upfront payment which has not yet been disclosed. In addition, Shire will be eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties. More importantly, CLBS has acquired a CD34+ cell therapy candidate that has already completed multiple placebo controlled studies. This includes the CD34+ cell therapy program for the treatment of refractory angina. The data set that has been obtained by Caladrius for this purchase is pre-clinical, phase 1, phase 2, and phase 3 clinical study data. Although CLBS may have to run its own Phase 3 trial to confirm the results before it can file for regulatory approval, its current market capitalization is only a fraction of its competitors, such as Athersys (ATHX) and Mesoblast (MESO). Athersys, Inc. ATHX, +0.00%   Market Cap: $226.2M, current share price: $1.83  ATHX recently announced an expansion to an existing development and commercialization deal with Healios KK, it current partner for stroke in Japan. The deal will focus on products for indications to include acute respiratory distress syndrome in Japan, as well as certain ophthalmological indications globally. Healios will also obtain an exclusive option to a license to develop and commercialize MultiStem products for ischemic stroke, ARDS, and trauma in China, and obtain certain other rights. In exchange, ATHX would receive committed payments of $35 million. Furthermore, Healios has invested approximately $21 million at $1.76 per share, a 13.5% premium to the previous closing price. ARCA Biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71%   Market Cap: $7.75M, current share price: $0.66  ABIO, which is developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases, recently announced topline results from GENETIC-AF, a Phase 2B, double-blind, superiority clinical trial evaluating Gencaro™ (bucindolol hydrochloride) as a genetically-targeted treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). In all patients, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit compared to the active control, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). In U.S. patients (127 of 267 total patients), a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 30% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL), was observed for the primary endpoint of time to recurrence of AF. Additionally, in U.S. patients, Gencaro demonstrated a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 51% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL) in a subset of patients who underwent continuous heart rhythm monitoring with Medtronic implanted devices. Safety data indicated that Gencaro was generally safe and well-tolerated in the AF/heart failure (HF) population investigated with a safety profile similar to TOPROL-XL. At its current market cap, a sub-$1.00 share price and a looming reverse stock split, ABIO may be a bargain purchase if its share price declines further following a capital raise and reverse split. Geron Corporation GERN, +0.47%   Market Cap: 697.2M, current share price: $4.34 Gern Corporation had an earning conference call today. The company's stock as a result finished up over 28% in today's trading session. Closing the day at $4.34, this is the highest the company's security has been priced in the last two years. Keep an eye on how GERN is trading for the next few sessions, today's call must of been a really good one.

WESTMINSTER, Colo., Feb. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARCA biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71% a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases, today announced clinical results from GENETIC-AF, a Phase 2B, double-blind, superiority clinical trial evaluating Gencaro [TM] (bucindolol hydrochloride) as a genetically-targeted treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF) in patients with heart failure and reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). In all patients, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit compared to the active control, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). In U.S. patients (127 of 267 total patients), a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 30% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL), was observed for the primary endpoint of time to recurrence of AF. Additionally, in U.S. patients, Gencaro demonstrated a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro (approximately 51% risk reduction over TOPROL-XL) in a subset of patients who underwent continuous heart rhythm monitoring with Medtronic implanted devices. Safety data indicated that Gencaro was generally safe and well-tolerated in the AF/heart failure (HF) population investigated with a safety profile similar to TOPROL-XL. GENETIC-AF enrolled 267 patients from the United States, Canada and Europe. The primary analysis was conducted to evaluate the evidence of safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus an active control with demonstrated effectiveness and safety in this patient population TOPROL-XL. The primary endpoint of the trial was time to recurrent AF, atrial flutter (AFL) or all-cause mortality (ACM). The trial was not powered to conventional significance for this endpoint and utilized Bayesian statistical modeling of predictive probability of success (PPoS) of the primary endpoint to estimate outcome if the trial had enrolled 620 patients with 330 primary events. In all patients, Gencaro demonstrated a similar treatment benefit compared to the active control, TOPROL-XL (143 total events, hazard ratio of 1.01 (95% confidence interval: 0.71, 1.42), which was associated with a PPoS of 14%. In the U.S. patient cohort of 127 patients (approximately 50% of all patients and events), a trend for potential superior benefit in favor of Gencaro over TOPROL-XL was observed (73 events, hazard ratio 0.70, [95% confidence interval: 0.41, 1.19]), with a PPoS of 61%, which was greater than the prespecified criteria set by the company to proceed to Phase 3 development. The Company believes the difference in treatment effects between the overall and U.S. patient cohorts was primarily due to results in two non-U.S. countries exhibiting hazard ratios >1.0. The differences between patients enrolled at these sites versus the U.S. and other country cohorts are being investigated. ""The U.S. data support our pre-trial assumptions and provide contemporary information to potentially design Phase 3 development of Gencaro,"" commented Dr. Debra Marshall, Senior Vice-President of Medical Affairs. ""I would like to thank our clinical investigators, as well as the patients and their families, for their participation in this study."" A subgroup of patients underwent continuous (24/7) heart rhythm monitoring via Medtronic implanted loop recorders or other Medtronic implanted therapeutic devices (e.g., ICDs, CRTs) to evaluate daily AF burden. AF burden is defined as the amount of time per day a patient experiences AF. A prespecified time-to-first event analysis was conducted using a total AF burden of at least 6 hours per day to define an event of AF recurrence. In this analysis, hazard ratios of 0.75 (0.43, 1.32) and 0.49 (0.24, 1.04) were observed in the overall (n=69) and U.S. patient (n=42) cohorts, respectively. Gencaro was generally safe and well-tolerated, with 84% of patients attaining their target dose compared to 72% of patients receiving TOPROL-XL. The most frequently reported adverse events were similar in both groups and consistent with the known safety profile of the beta-blocker class of drugs. Adverse events assessed as related to study drug by the investigator occurred in 23.8% of patients in the Gencaro group and in 30.1% of patients in the TOPROL-XL group. Of note, adverse events of bradycardia were less frequently reported in the Gencaro group (3.7%) compared to patients receiving TOPROL-XL (12.0%). During the 24-week efficacy follow-up period there were three deaths (ACM) in the TOPROL-XL group and none in the Gencaro group. Three patients died in the long-term treatment extension period after receiving Gencaro for more than a year. ""We are pleased to share these results from our GENETIC-AF clinical trial. It should be emphasized that the control drug in the study, TOPROL-XL, although not FDA approved for this indication, has demonstrated efficacy in preventing AF in HFrEF. While we did observe some regional heterogeneity in effectiveness of Gencaro, we believe the treatment response observed in the U.S. population, which represents approximately half of the overall study population, support continued development of Gencaro as a genetically-targeted treatment for atrial fibrillation,"" commented Dr. Michael Bristow, ARCA's President and CEO. ""As in all Phase 2 trials, which in part are conducted to elicit information relevant to the design for Phase 3, elucidation of the reason(s) for regional heterogeneity could prove valuable for Phase 3 trial design."" ARCA anticipates meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the second quarter of 2018 to review Gencaro Phase 2 data and potential Phase 3 development plan. ARCA ended 2017 with cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling $11.8 million (unaudited) and believes that these funds, with additional net proceeds of approximately $3.4 million (unaudited) raised in January 2018 through its existing ""At-the-Market"" offering facility, will be sufficient to fund its operations, at its projected cost structure, through the end of 2018. GENETIC-AF Clinical Trial GENETIC-AF is a Phase 2B, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, superiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro to Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Eligible patients had HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that ARCA believes responds most favorably to Gencaro. Conference Call and Webcast ARCA will hold a conference call and live audio webcast today, Monday, February 26, 2018 at 9:00 am Eastern (7:00am Mountain) to discuss results from the GENETIC-AF clinical trial.

The webcast will be archived for 90 days. About GencaroTM (bucindolol hydrochloride) Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride) is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator being developed for the treatment of AF. Gencaro is considered part of the beta-blocker class of compounds because of its property of blocking both beta-1 and beta-2 receptors in the heart. The blocking of these receptors prevents them from binding with other molecules, primarily the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, which activate these receptors. ARCA believes that Gencaro is well-tolerated in cardiovascular patients because of its mild vasodilator effects. Originally developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Gencaro, bucindolol hydrochloride, has been tested clinically in approximately 4,500 patients, including over 3,250 patients in eight clinical trials in HFrEF patients. Gencaro was the subject of a Phase 3 HF mortality trial in 2,708 patients, mostly in the United States (the ""BEST trial""). The BEST trial included a DNA bank of over 1,000 patients, which was used to evaluate the effect of genetic variation on patients' response to Gencaro. About ARCA biopharma ARCA biopharma is dedicated to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases through a precision medicine approach to drug development. ARCA's lead product candidate, Gencaro [TM] (bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator being developed for the potential treatment of patients with AF and HFrEF which recently completed a Phase 2B clinical trial. ARCA has identified common genetic variations that it believes predict individual patient response to Gencaro, giving it the potential to be the first genetically-targeted AF prevention treatment. ARCA has a collaboration with Medtronic, Inc. for support of the GENETIC-AF trial. The Gencaro development program has been granted Fast Track designation by FDA. ARCA also plans to develop AB171, a thiol-substituted isosorbide mononitrate, as a potential genetically-targeted treatment for peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and for HF.

ABIO,"Jan 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- GENETIC-AF Evaluating Gencaro as Potentially First Genetically-Targeted Treatment for Atrial Fibrillation -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- ARCA Estimates Reporting Top-line Phase 2B Data in March 2018 Dr. Michael Bristow, President and CEO, ARCA biopharma, Inc.   WESTMINSTER, Colo., Jan. 08, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARCA biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71% a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases, today announced the completion of patient follow-up for GENETIC-AF, a Phase 2B, double-blind, superiority clinical trial evaluating Gencaro [TM] (bucindolol hydrochloride) as a potential genetically-targeted treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). All patients completed their last study visits and were transitioned off study drug by the end of December 2017. ARCA expects to report top-line Phase 2B data in March 2018. ""Completion of patient treatment in GENETIC-AF represents a key clinical milestone for ARCA and we look forward to reporting top-line data for the trial, which we estimate should include approximately 50% more events than were available at the previously conducted interim analysis,"" commented Dr. Michael Bristow, ARCA's President and CEO. ""I would like to thank our clinical investigators as well as the patients and their families for their participation. We will continue working diligently to advance Gencaro's pharmacogenetic clinical and regulatory development."" GENETIC-AF Clinical Trial GENETIC-AF is a Phase 2B, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, superiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro to Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Eligible patients have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that ARCA believes responds most favorably to Gencaro. The GENETIC-AF Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) conducted a pre-specified interim analysis in August 2017. Based on its efficacy and safety review, the DSMB recommended completion of the Phase 2B trial and indicated there were no safety concerns. The other protocol specified options for the interim analysis were accelerated development that would have transitioned the trial seamlessly to a larger Phase 3 trial of approximately 620 patients, or immediately stopping for futility. The Phase 2B trial enrolled 267 patients from the United States, Canada and Europe. All patients have completed their last study visits and transitioned off study drug. ARCA is currently performing final monitoring visits and anticipates having evaluable data for approximately 250 patients in the final Phase 2B analysis. A randomized patient has evaluable data either when they experience their first composite endpoint event, AF/AFL or all-cause mortality, or after completion of the 24-week primary endpoint follow-up period. As the trial was statistically powered for the larger Phase 3 population, the final Phase 2B analysis will follow the same Bayesian methodology that was employed in the DSMB interim analysis, i.e., modeling the predictive probability of success (PPOS) of a future 620-patient Phase 3 study based on the time to first event of AF/AFL or all-cause mortality endpoint. About ARCA biopharma ARCA biopharma is dedicated to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases through a precision medicine approach to drug development. ARCA's lead product candidate, Gencaro [TM] (bucindolol hydrochloride), is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator being developed for the potential treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation and HFrEF, currently in a Phase 2B clinical trial. ARCA has identified common genetic variations that it believes predict individual patient response to Gencaro, giving it the potential to be the first genetically-targeted atrial fibrillation prevention treatment. ARCA has a collaboration with Medtronic, Inc. for support of the GENETIC-AF trial. The Gencaro development program has been granted Fast Track designation by the FDA. For more information, please visit www.arcabio.com. Safe Harbor Statement This press release contains ""forward-looking statements"" for purposes of the safe harbor provided by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding, the potential timeline for GENETIC-AF trial activities, potential timing for the announcement of topline data for the Phase 2B GENETIC-AF trial, the expected features and characteristics of Gencaro, including the potential for genetic variations to predict individual patient response to Gencaro, Gencaro's potential to treat AF, future treatment options for patients with AF, and the potential for Gencaro to be the first genetically-targeted AF prevention treatment. Such statements are based on management's current expectations and involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results and performance could differ materially from those projected in the forward-looking statements as a result of many factors, including, without limitation, the risks and uncertainties associated with: ARCA's financial resources and whether they will be sufficient to meet its business objectives and operational requirements; results of earlier clinical trials may not be confirmed in future trials; the protection and market exclusivity provided by ARCA's intellectual property; risks related to the drug discovery and the regulatory approval process; and, the impact of competitive products and technological changes. These and other factors are identified and described in more detail in ARCA's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation ARCA's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016, and subsequent filings.

The European patent has been validated in ten countries: Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Kingdom. ARCA has related patent applications pending in the United States Patent Office and Canadian Intellectual Property Office. Dr. Michael Bristow, President and CEO, ARCA biopharma, Inc.   A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/af496e97-20da-420a-bf93-e51b3a3ed740 ARCA has discovered what it believes to be a pharmacogenetic target for AB171 that is the basis for the patents and which the company believes may enable genetically-targeted cardiovascular development programs. ARCA plans to advance development of AB171, a potential New Chemical Entity (NCE), for the treatment of two cardiovascular indications: peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and chronic heart failure (HF). The compound, formerly known as LA-419, was previously under development at Lacer, S.A., where multiple Phase 1 studies were conducted to assess pharmacokinetics and clinical tolerability. ARCA has collaborated with Elucida Research in the preclinical development of AB171. The Company anticipates initiating chemistry, manufacturing and controls (CMC) activities in the first half of 2018, followed by nonclinical studies with AB171 to support submission of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application. ""ARCA was founded on the belief that a precision medicine approach to drug development, tailoring medical treatment to functionally important genetic variants in drug targets that also serve as biomarkers, can enable more effective therapies, improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. The addition of AB171 to our genetically-targeted development pipeline, including the Gencaro atrial fibrillation-heart failure program, is consistent with that mission,"" commented Dr. Michael Bristow, ARCA's President and CEO.

ARCA's current levels of staffing and expertise allow for the simultaneous activation of the AB171 program and organization of the potential next steps for Gencaro."" ARCA believes that its current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operations, at its projected cost structure, through the end of second quarter of 2018. About AB171 AB171 is a thiol-containing derivative of isosorbide mononitrate. Pre-clinical data indicate that AB171 has significant anti-oxidant properties and is favorably differentiated from other nitrates for prevention of myocardial remodeling, anti-atherosclerotic effects and the development of tolerance. ARCA believes the unique pharmacology of AB171, coupled with targeting to genetically-identified enhanced response subpopulations, has the potential to translate to better long-term responses than treatment with traditional pharmacotherapy.

""With enrollment completed in the GENETIC-AF clinical trial evaluating Gencaro as potentially the first genetically-targeted treatment for atrial fibrillation, we are finishing patient follow-up and anticipate reporting top-line data late in the first quarter of 2018,"" commented Dr. Michael Bristow, ARCA's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We are focused on executing our genetically-targeted approach to cardiovascular drug development and look forward to furthering our development of Gencaro as well as initiating additional pharmacogenetic development programs."" Third Quarter 2017 Summary Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $16.0 million as of September 30, 2017, compared to $23.5 million as of December 31, 2016. ARCA had approximately 11.75 million outstanding shares of common stock as of September 30, 2017. ARCA believes that its current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operations, at its projected cost structure, through the end of second quarter of 2018. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017 totaled $3.5 million compared to $3.7 million for the corresponding period of 2016, a decrease of approximately $0.2 million. R&D expense for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 totaled $11.2 million compared to $9.2 million for the corresponding period of 2016, an increase of approximately $2.0 million. The changes in R&D expenses in the three and nine month periods ended September 30, 2017 was due primarily to the increased expense of ARCA's GENETIC-AF clinical trial. The Company expects R&D expenses in 2017 to be higher than 2016 as it reached peak patient screening activity and patient enrollment for the GENETIC-AF clinical trial during 2017. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were $1.0 million compared to $1.0 million for the corresponding period in 2016. G&A expenses totaled $3.2 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 as compared to $3.1 million for the corresponding period in 2016, a net increase of approximately $79,000. The increase for the nine periods was comprised primarily of higher consulting costs and professional fees, partially offset by decreased non-cash, stock-based compensation expense in 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016. ARCA expects G&A expenses in 2017 to be higher than in 2016 due to increased administrative activities to support the GENETIC-AF clinical trial and costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2017 for the acquisition of certain Gencaro license rights from Aeolus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. which previously held certain royalty rights on the Gencaro program. Total operating expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were $4.5 million compared to $4.7 million for the corresponding period in 2016. Total operating expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $14.4 million compared to $12.3 million for the corresponding period in 2016. The changes in total operating for the nine month periods was primarily due to the increase in R&D expense due to the increased clinical expense of the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. Net loss was $4.4 million, or $0.39 per share, for the third quarter of 2017 compared to $4.7 million, or $0.51 per share, for the third quarter of 2016. Net loss for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $14.3 million, or $1.43 per share, compared to $12.2 million, or $1.35 per share, for the corresponding period in 2016. GENETIC-AF Clinical Trial GENETIC-AF is a Phase 2B, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, superiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro to Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Eligible patients have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that ARCA believes responds most favorably to Gencaro. The GENETIC-AF Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) conducted a pre-specified interim analysis of all patients randomized as of June 19, 2017. Based on its efficacy and safety review, the DSMB recommended completion of the Phase 2B trial with no changes to the trial design and indicated that there were no safety concerns.

ABIO,"Aug 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- GENETIC-AF Evaluating Gencaro as Potentially First Genetically-Targeted Treatment for Atrial Fibrillation Dr. Michael Bristow, President and CEO, ARCA biopharma, Inc.   ARCA Estimates Reporting Top-line Phase 2B Data in the First Quarter of 2018 WESTMINSTER, Colo., Aug. 16, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARCA biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71% a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases, today announced the completion of enrollment for GENETIC-AF, a Phase 2B, double-blind, superiority clinical trial evaluating Gencaro [TM] (bucindolol hydrochloride) as a potential genetically-targeted treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). ARCA expects to report top-line Phase 2B data late in the first quarter of 2018. A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/af496e97-20da-420a-bf93-e51b3a3ed740 Two-hundred sixty-seven patients were randomized into the trial, slightly exceeding the target enrollment of 250 patients. The trial enrolled patients from the United States, Canada and Europe. ""We believe reaching our target enrollment in GENETIC-AF represents a key clinical milestone for ARCA and we look forward to reporting top-line data for the trial, which we estimate should include approximately 50% more events than were available at the recently conducted interim analysis,"" commented Dr. Michael Bristow, ARCA's President and CEO.

ABIO,"Aug 09, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- ARCA Estimates Reporting Top-line Phase 2B Data in the First Quarter of 2018  Gencaro Development Program Has Been Granted Fast Track Designation by U.S. FDA WESTMINSTER, Colo., Aug. 09, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARCA biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71% a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases, today announced that the GENETIC-AF trial Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) completed its pre-specified Phase 2B interim analysis. Based on its efficacy and safety review, the DSMB recommended completion of the Phase 2B trial with no changes to the trial design. GENETIC-AF is a clinical trial evaluating Gencaro [TM] (bucindolol hydrochloride) as a potential treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). The Gencaro development program has been granted Fast Track designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). ""The DSMB stated that there were no safety concerns and that the efficacy results met the prespecified criteria for continuing the Phase 2B trial to completion. We are pleased with the execution of the study thus far with major pretrial assumptions reflected in the trial to date, including genotype frequency, AF/AFL event rate and patient screening rates. We believe the DSMB recommendation is encouraging, as the trial is testing for superior efficacy over the active comparator, TOPROL-XL,"" commented Dr. Michael Bristow, ARCA's President and CEO. ""We are now focused on completing the Phase 2B trial, which we estimate should include approximately 50% more events than were available at the interim analysis. We look forward to sharing the top-line trial results late in the first quarter of next year, and reviewing the findings with the FDA."" GENETIC-AF Clinical Trial GENETIC-AF is a Phase 2B, adaptive design, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, superiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro to TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Eligible patients will have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that ARCA believes responds most favorably to Gencaro. The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of symptomatic AF/AFL or all-cause mortality. The GENETIC-AF trial design has been reviewed by the FDA. The trial is enrolling patients in the United States, Canada and Europe. The Company estimates reporting top-line Phase 2B data late in the first quarter of 2018. ARCA believes that its current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operations, at its projected cost structure, into the second quarter of 2018. Interim Efficacy Analysis The DSMB performed a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy data from all patients randomized as of June 19, 2017. The primary analysis on the data from these patients was conducted to evaluate the evidence of safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). The prospectively defined features of this analysis included an estimate of Gencaro effectiveness relative to TOPROL-XL and an assessment of safety as characterized by adverse events. The primary analysis method generated predictive probability of success (PPoS) values that were compared to prespecified PPoS boundaries constructed from Bayesian statistical modeling. Prospectively defined PPoS ranges had been predetermined to define three potential outcomes based on the projection of the Phase 2B interim results: 1) transition the trial to Phase 3; 2) completion of the Phase 2B stage of the trial, based on an intermediate result that is potentially favorable but does not support immediate transition of the trial to Phase 3; or, 3) immediate termination of the trial due to futility, if the PPoS results fall below the boundary for completion as a Phase 2 trial. Based on the efficacy and safety data of the interim analysis, the DSMB recommended completing the Phase 2B trial with no changes to the trial design. In order to maintain the integrity of the on-going double-blind clinical trial, the unblinded statistical data available to the DSMB has not and will not be disclosed to ARCA, the trial leadership, or the investigators until the Phase 2B trial is complete. ARCA estimates reporting top-line data for the Phase 2B trial late in the first quarter of 2018. About Gencaro Gencaro (bucindolol hydrochloride) is an investigational, pharmacologically unique beta-blocker and mild vasodilator being developed for the treatment of AF. Gencaro is considered part of the beta-blocker class of compounds because of its property of blocking both beta-1 and beta-2, receptors in the heart. The blocking of these receptors prevents them from binding with other molecules, primarily the neurotransmitter norepinephrine, or NE, which activate these receptors. ARCA believes that Gencaro is well-tolerated in cardiovascular patients because of its mild vasodilator effects. Originally developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Gencaro, bucindolol hydrochloride, has been tested clinically in approximately 4,500 patients, including over 3,000 patients in seven clinical trials in HFrEF patients. Gencaro was the subject of a Phase 3 HF mortality trial in 2,708 patients, mostly in the United States, or the BEST trial. The BEST trial included a DNA bank of over 1,000 patients, which was used to evaluate the effect of genetic variation on patients' response to Gencaro.

ABIO,"WESTMINSTER, Colo., Aug 03, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- ARCA biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71% a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases, today reported financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, and provided a business update. ""We continue to make progress in the GENETIC-AF clinical trial with more than 250 patients now randomized,"" commented Dr. Michael Bristow, ARCA's President and Chief Executive Officer. ""We are awaiting the outcome of the ongoing DSMB interim efficacy analysis that will recommend the next steps for this adaptive, seamless design trial - transitioning to Phase 3 and enrolling an additional 370 patients; completing Phase 2B with approximately 250 patients; or, stopping immediately for futility. We expect the outcome of this important clinical milestone in August."" Second Quarter 2017 Summary Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $16.0 million as of June 30, 2017, compared to $23.5 million as of December 31, 2016. ARCA had approximately 10.1 million outstanding shares of common stock as of June 30, 2017. Subsequent to June 30, 2017, the Company sold an aggregate of 1,634,158 shares of common stock through its existing ""at the market offering"", raising net proceeds of approximately $3.9 million. As of July 25, 2017, ARCA has sold all shares available under the prospectus to its registration statement on Form S-3 (No. 333-217459) and does not currently anticipate making any additional sales under this facility. ARCA believes that its current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operations, at its projected cost structure, through the end of 2017. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $4.5 million compared to $2.9 million for the corresponding period of 2016, an increase of approximately $1.6 million. R&D expense for the six months ended June 30, 2017 totaled $7.8 million compared to $5.5 million for the corresponding period of 2016, an increase of approximately $2.2 million. The increase in R&D expense in the three and six month periods ended June 30, 2017 was due primarily to the increased expense of ARCA's GENETIC AF clinical trial, including contract research organization costs, clinical site initiation and monitoring activities, patient visit costs and increased costs to support expanding the trial into Europe. The Company expects R&D expenses in 2017 to be higher than 2016 as it activates new clinical sites and enrolls additional patients in the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $1.1 million compared to $1.0 million for the corresponding period in 2016, a net increase of approximately $23,000. G&A expenses totaled $2.2 million for the six months ended June 30, 2017 as compared to $2.1 million for the corresponding period in 2016, a net increase of approximately $84,000. The increase for the three and six month periods is comprised primarily of higher consulting costs and professional fees. These increases are partially offset by decreased non-cash, stock-based compensation expense in 2017, as compared to the corresponding periods in 2016. ARCA expects G&A expenses in 2017 to be higher than in 2016 as it increases administrative activities to support the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. Total operating expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2017 were $5.6 million compared to $3.9 million for the corresponding period in 2016. Total operating expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2017 were $9.9 million compared to $7.6 million for the corresponding period in 2016. The increase in total operating for the three and six month periods was primarily due to the increase in R&D expense due to the increased clinical expense of the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. Net loss was $5.5 million, or $0.59 per share, for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $3.9 million, or $0.43 per share, for the second quarter of 2016. Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2017 was $9.9 million, or $1.07 per share, compared to $7.5 million, or $0.83 per share, for the corresponding period in 2016. GENETIC-AF Clinical Trial GENETIC-AF is an adaptive, seamless design Phase 2B/3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, superiority clinical trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro to Toprol-XL (metoprolol succinate) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF). Eligible patients will have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that ARCA believes responds most favorably to Gencaro. The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of symptomatic AF/AFL or all-cause mortality. The GENETIC-AF trial design has been reviewed by the FDA. The trial is currently enrolling patients in the United States, Canada and Europe. Phase 2B Interim Efficacy Analysis The GENETIC-AF Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is performing a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy data. The primary analysis will be conducted to evaluate the evidence for safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). The prospectively defined features of this analysis include an estimate of Gencaro effectiveness relative to TOPROL-XL and an assessment of safety as characterized by adverse events. The primary analysis method will generate predictive probability of success (PPoS) values that will be compared to prespecified PPoS boundaries constructed from Bayesian statistical modeling. Prospectively defined PPoS ranges have been predetermined to define three potential outcomes based on the projection of the Phase 2B interim results: 1) transition the trial to Phase 3 based on a likelihood of achieving a statistically significant hazard ratio in favor of Gencaro (evidence of an effectiveness signal consistent with pretrial assumptions) and enroll up to a total of 620 patients (including the Phase 2B patients); 2) completion of the Phase 2B stage of the trial including 24-week follow-up of all randomized subjects, based on an intermediate result that is potentially favorable but does not support transition of the trial to Phase 3; or, 3) immediate termination of the trial due to futility, if the PPoS results fall below the boundary for completion as a Phase 2 trial. ARCA, in collaboration with the GENETIC-AF Steering Committee, will determine the most appropriate path forward for the trial based on the DSMB recommendation from this interim analysis. The Company expects to announce the DSMB's recommendation based on this interim analysis in August 2017. The unblinded statistical data available to the DSMB will not be disclosed to ARCA or the public.

ABIO,"Jun 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- GENETIC-AF Evaluating Gencaro as Potentially First Genetically-Targeted Treatment for Atrial Fibrillation Dr. Michael Bristow, President and CEO, ARCA biopharma, Inc.   Gencaro Development Program Previously Granted Fast Track Designation by U.S. FDA WESTMINSTER, Colo., June 20, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- ARCA biopharma, Inc. ABIO, +1.71% a biopharmaceutical company applying a precision medicine approach to developing genetically-targeted therapies for cardiovascular diseases, today announced database lock for the GENETIC-AF Phase 2B interim efficacy analysis, to be conducted by the trial Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB). GENETIC-AF is a seamless design Phase 2B/3 clinical trial evaluating Gencaro [TM] (bucindolol hydrochloride) as a potential treatment for atrial fibrillation (AF). The Company expects to announce the DSMB's recommendation based on this interim analysis in August 2017.

A photo accompanying this announcement is available at http://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/af496e97-20da-420a-bf93-e51b3a3ed740 ""Reaching database lock for the interim analysis and the collection and processing of trial data for the DSMB mark important points in the development of Gencaro. We are hopeful a positive DSMB recommendation will further support our data-driven rationale for development of the first genetically-targeted treatment candidate for atrial fibrillation in heart failure patients,"" commented Dr. Michael Bristow, ARCA's President and CEO. ""Based on our view of the strength of prior AF prevention data from the BEST trial and pursuant to discussions with the FDA, we have incorporated a seamless design feature for this trial. Beyond the potential for a positive recommendation of completing GENETIC-AF as a Phase 2B trial, the interim analysis allows for a recommendation to advance directly to Phase 3 if the analyzed Phase 2B cohort is responding favorably to treatment, with retention of these patients' data in the final Phase 3 analysis. This approach substantially reduces the number of patients required to complete Phase 3, potentially allowing for a more rapid development program devoid of the risks of starting a new trial dissociated from a positive Phase 2 experience.""

The trial is currently enrolling patients in the United States, Canada and Europe. Phase 2B Interim Efficacy Analysis The DSMB will perform a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy data from a minimum of 150 patients with evaluable data. A randomized patient has evaluable data either when they experience their first composite endpoint event, AF/AFL or all-cause mortality, or after completion of the 24-week primary endpoint follow-up period. The primary analysis will include data from all randomized subjects at the time of database lock. The primary analysis will be conducted to evaluate the evidence for safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL).

""We are focused on the upcoming DSMB interim efficacy analysis that will determine the next steps for this adaptive, seamless design trial - transitioning to Phase 3 and enrolling an additional 370 patients; completing Phase 2B with 250 patients; or, stopping immediately for futility.  We expect the outcome of this interim efficacy analysis in September 2017."" Dr. Bristow further commented, ""Atrial fibrillation is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease based on the pace of increase in incidence in the United States and industrialized countries. There is also increasing evidence that compared to heart failure with sinus rhythm, heart failure with atrial fibrillation responds differently to medical therapy and needs to be approached as a separate disorder. We believe that a precision medicine approach to drug development in atrial fibrillation-heart failure, tailoring medical treatment to the individual genetic characteristics of patient subgroups, can potentially enable more effective therapies, improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs."" First Quarter 2017 Summary Financial Results Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $19.2 million as of March 31, 2017, compared to $23.5 million as of December 31, 2016. ARCA believes that its current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund its operations, at its projected cost structure, through the end of 2017.  ARCA had approximately 9.2 million outstanding shares of common stock as of March 31, 2017. Research and development (R&D) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 totaled $3.2 million compared to $2.6 million for the corresponding period of 2016, an increase of approximately $0.7 million.  The increase in R&D expenses in the first quarter of 2017 as compared to the first quarter of 2016 was primarily due to increased expenses for the GENETIC-AF clinical trial, including contract research organization costs, clinical site initiation and monitoring activities, patient visit costs and increased costs to support expanding the trial into Europe.  The Company expects R&D expenses in 2017 to be higher than 2016 as it activates new clinical sites and enrolls additional patients in the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. General and administrative (G&A) expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $1.1 million compared to $1.1 million for the corresponding period in 2016, a net increase of approximately $60,000.  The increase in expenses during the first quarter of 2017 was comprised primarily of higher consulting costs.  This increase is partially offset by decreased non-cash, stock-based compensation expense in 2017, as compared to the corresponding period in 2016.  ARCA expects G&A expenses in 2017 to be higher than in 2016 as it increases administrative activities to support the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. Total operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 were $4.4 million compared to $3.7 million for the corresponding period in 2016.  The increase in total operating expenses during the first quarter of 2017 was primarily due to the increase in R&D expense due to the increased clinical expense of the GENETIC-AF clinical trial. Net loss was $4.3 million, or $0.48 per share, for the first quarter of 2017 compared to $3.6 million, or $0.40 per share, for the first quarter of 2016. GENETIC-AF Clinical Trial GENETIC-AF is an adaptive, seamless design Phase 2B/3, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, clinical superiority trial comparing the safety and efficacy of Gencaro to TOPROL-XL (metoprolol succinate) for the treatment and prevention of recurrent atrial fibrillation or flutter (AF/AFL) in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF).

The analysis will be conducted to evaluate the evidence for safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). The prospectively defined features of this analysis include an estimate of Gencaro effectiveness relative to TOPROL-XL and an assessment of safety as characterized by adverse events. The relative benefit estimate will utilize Bayesian statistical methods to calculate the predictive probability of the Phase 3 patient cohort hazard ratio (a measure of an effect of an intervention on an outcome of interest over time) based on the interim Phase 2B data. Prospectively defined ranges of predictive probabilities have been predetermined to define three potential outcomes based on the projection of the Phase 2B interim results: 1) transition the trial to Phase 3 based on a likelihood of achieving a statistically significant hazard ratio in favor of Gencaro (evidence of an effectiveness signal consistent with pretrial assumptions) and enroll up to a total of 620 patients (including the Phase 2B patients); 2) completion of the Phase 2B stage of the trial including 24-week follow-up of all randomized subjects (approximately 250 patients), based on an intermediate result that is potentially favorable but does not support transition of the trial to Phase 3; or, 3) immediate termination of the trial due to futility.

The unblinded statistical data available to the DSMB will not be disclosed to the Company or the public.  ARCA expects the outcome of this interim efficacy analysis in September 2017. Atrial Fibrillation (AF) Atrial fibrillation, the most common sustained cardiac arrhythmia, is considered an epidemic cardiovascular disease and a major public health burden.  The estimated number of individuals with AF globally in 2010 was 33.5 million. According to the 2017 American Heart Association report on Cardiovascular Disease, approximately 5.2 million people in the United States had atrial fibrillation in 2015, with medical and indirect costs totaling an estimated $31 billion.  Hospitalization rates for AF increased by 23% among U.S. adults from 2000 to 2010 and hospitalizations account for the majority of the economic cost burden associated with AF.

Eligible patients will have HFrEF, a history of paroxysmal AF (episodes lasting 7 days or less) or persistent AF (episodes lasting more than 7 days and less than 1 year) in the past 6 months, and the beta-1 389 arginine homozygous genotype that ARCA believes responds most favorably to Gencaro. The primary endpoint of the study is time to first event of symptomatic AF/AFL or all-cause mortality. The trial is currently enrolling patients in the United States, Canada and Europe. Phase 2B Interim Efficacy Analysis The GENETIC-AF Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will perform a pre-specified interim analysis of unblinded efficacy data when at least 150 patients have evaluable data. A randomized patient has evaluable data either when they experience their first composite endpoint event, AF/AFL or all-cause mortality, or after completion of the 24-week primary endpoint follow-up period. The analysis will be conducted to evaluate the evidence for safety and superior efficacy of Gencaro versus the active comparator, metoprolol succinate (TOPROL-XL). The prospectively defined features of this analysis include an estimate of Gencaro effectiveness relative to TOPROL-XL and an assessment of safety as characterized by adverse events. The relative benefit estimate will utilize Bayesian statistical methods to calculate the predictive probability of the Phase 3 patient cohort hazard ratio (a measure of an effect of an intervention on an outcome of interest over time) based on the interim Phase 2B data. Prospectively defined ranges of predictive probabilities have been predetermined to define three potential outcomes based on the projection of the Phase 2B interim results: ARCA, in collaboration with the trial Steering Committee, will determine the most appropriate path forward for the trial based on the DSMB recommendation from this interim analysis. The unblinded statistical data available to the DSMB will not be disclosed to the Company or the public. ARCA expects the outcome of this interim efficacy analysis in September 2017.
