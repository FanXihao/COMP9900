OFC,"Real estate investment trusts, or REITs, have outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 Index this year, as investors have sought out high yields at a time of historically low interest rates. But if you’re worried about spending too much for REITs, most of whose dividend payments are backed by rents or leases, there are still good values if income is your main objective. The S&P 500 REIT subsector trades for 19.6 times weighted aggregate consensus FFO estimates for the next 12 months, according to FactSet. (REITs are valued according to funds from operations, or FFO, rather than earnings per share. FFO is a non-GAAP measure calculated by adding depreciation and amortization back to earnings, while subtracting gains from the sale of real estate. It is considered the best way of measuring a REIT’s ability to pay dividends.) Looking at the 15-year chart, below, you can see they have reached forward price-to-FFO multiples exceeding 20 on many occasions since late 2008, while reaching a peak of 24.2 times forward FFO in February 2007, the height of the real estate market before the subprime crisis. FactSet So far this year, through Aug. 12, the S&P 500 REIT subsector has risen 9.8%, compared with 6.7% for the S&P 500. This time we have not included reinvested dividends, to make a more fair comparison of how well the subsector has performed relative to the index. REITs tend to pay higher dividends than most S&P 500 SPX, -2.91%  stocks because that is their objective. In fact, they are required to pay out 90% of their earnings to shareholders. Why buy now? So should you consider REITs now? Maybe, if you are investing for income, or if you have a strong belief that a particular REIT is positioned to perform well as its business grows, or both. Since the market values of income-producing securities generally move in the opposite direction of interest rates, there can be quite a bit of volatility over the next few years if the Federal Reserve raises interest rates consistently. The Fed has raised rates only once, in December 2015, since 2006. Even the fear of higher interest rates can drive prices lower. But if you need the income, and can tolerate volatility as interest rates fluctuate and headlines anticipate and exaggerate the market’s reaction, it’s not too late to make a purchase. Last week we published a list of S&P 500 dividend stocks, including REITs, with attractive dividend yields supported by FFO for the REITs and free cash flow for the others.

OFC,"WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — Among the stocks that could see active trade in Thursday’s session are Ruby Tuesday Inc., Richardson Electronics Ltd. and API Technologies Corp. Safeway Inc. US:SWY  heads up the roster of companies on deck to post quarterly financial results Thursday. Cantel Medical Corp. US:CMN  , Oil-Dri Corp. of America ODC, -2.74%  , Zep Inc. US:ZEP  , Fastenal Co.

Four initial public offerings are on Thursday’s agenda, the largest of which is for Realogy Holdings Corp. RLGY, -0.16% owner of Century 21, Coldwell Banker, ERA and Better Homes & Gardens Real Estate. Parsippany, N.J.-based Realogy’s IPO ranks among the biggest seen in the U.S. market for 2012 — 40 million shares priced at $27 each. Trading in Realogy shares will be on the New York Stock Exchange, under the symbol RLGY. Also on deck, Shutterstock Inc. SSTK, -2.43%  priced its IPO of 4.5 million common shares at $17 each; underwriters have a 30-day option to buy up to 675,000 additional shares. NYSE trading in Shutterstock’s shares will be under the symbol SSTK. Intercept Pharmaceuticals Inc. ICPT, -1.80%  and Kythera Biopharmaceuticals Inc. round out Thursday’s IPOs.

Their shares will debut Thursday on Nasdaq Stock Market, under the symbols ICPT and KYTH, respectively. Read more on Thursday’s roster of IPOs. Along with reporting results for the first quarter ended Sept. 4, Ruby Tuesday US:RT  projected that profit for fiscal 2013 will be in a range of 20 cents to 30 cents a share, including recognition of 4 cents a share for pension settlement expense involving departing Chief Executive Sandy Beall, founder of the Maryville, Tenn.-based operator of casual-dining restaurants, and for new CEO transition expenses. Same-restaurant sales increased 1.9% at company-owned properties in the latest quarter, reversing a recent pattern for Ruby Tuesday, as total revenue inched up 0.8%. For the year, same-restaurant sales are forecast to be flat to 2% higher. Ruby Tuesday’s first-quarter profit came to $2.6 million, or 4 cents a share, down from $3.1 million, or 5 cents, earned in the year-earlier period. Excluding CEO transition costs, earnings would have been 5 cents a share, a penny shy of the consensus of analysts polled by Thomson Reuters. Along with results for the first quarter ended Sept. 1, Richardson Electronics RELL, -1.26%  forecast sales for the current quarter will be modestly higher on a sequential basis. The company projected a top line of $36 million to $38 million for the second quarter of fiscal 2013, compared to $35.7 million in the latest quarter; sales were $41.5 million in the year-earlier first quarter. “Global economic conditions continued to weaken as we progressed through the first quarter, contributing to the decline in our overall sales volume,” said Edward Richardson, chairman, chief executive and president, in the Lafox, Ill.-based company’s earnings release. API Technologies US:ATNY  said it’s received “unsolicited interest” in acquiring one or more of the company’s business units. The board of Orlando-based API hired Jefferies & Co. to serve as financial adviser in evaluating a “full range of strategic alternatives,” the company said. The move came as API reported results for the third quarter ended Aug. 31, which showed the company posting a wider net loss of $27.7 million compared to the prior year as well as lower revenue of $68.4 million. On an adjusted basis, API’s quarterly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization improved to $9.3 million from the prior year’s $8.1 million, the results showed. Also late Wednesday, PrivateBancorp Inc. US:PVTB  commenced an underwritten public offering of $75 million in common stock and plans a separate offering of $125 million in subordinated debt “in the near future,” the Chicago-based company said. Subject to Federal Reserve approval, net proceeds will go toward a full redemption of $243.8 million in preferred stock that PrivateBancorp issued to the Treasury Department under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, after which the company would seek to buy back the common stock warrant issued to the Treasury as part of its participation in TARP. Completion of the stock offering isn’t conditioned on completion of the anticipated subordinated debt offering, and vice versa, according to PrivateBancorp. Royal Gold Inc. RGLD, +1.58%  will put up for sale nearly 5.3 million common shares in an at-the-market public offering, the Denver-based company said. Net proceeds will be used for the acquisition of additional royalty or similar interests and for general corporate purposes, with the offering expected to close Oct. 15. Underwriters led by Goldman Sachs & Co. will have the option to buy up to 750,000 additional shares from Royal Gold. Corporate Office Properties Trust OFC, -0.93%  said it plans to sell 6 million newly issued common shares stock via a secondary public offering. The Columbia, Md.-based real estate investment trust will put net proceeds to use repaying credit-revolver balances and for general corporate purposes. Underwriters will have a 30-day option to buy up to 900,000 additional shares. Standard & Poor’s said Government Properties Income Trust GOV, -3.37% an office REIT based in Newton, Mass., will become part of the S&P SmallCap 600 after the close of trading on Oct. 15, taking the place of Brightpoint Inc. US:CELL  in the benchmark. Ingram Micro Inc. US:IM  is close to completing the acquisition of Brightpoint, necessitating the change.

OFC,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- A Citigroup analyst who covers real estate investment trusts rejiggered his ratings on several individual names Monday and said the economic backdrop could support current elevated valuations for the sector over the next year. ""At the same time, there remain clear long-term risks to the recovery following record stimulus that some feel has simply shifted the private credit bubble to the public,"" Michael Bilerman wrote about the outlook for REITs in 2010. The analyst said he sees the total return for REITs in 2010 as flat to 10% higher, with close to half of that from dividends. ""Stock selection will be key to driving excess returns, and our overweight and underweight positions have been selected to hedge against an uncertain environment,"" Bilerman said. REITs suffered through a dreadful 2008 as investors dumped commercial real estate when the credit crunch hit the economy. The SPDR Dow Jones REIT ETF RWR, -1.74% lost nearly 40% last year. The exchange-traded fund has recovered some of those losses and was up 23.5% for the year through Dec. 11. It trails the broader stock market slightly, and many investors are predicting more pain ahead for commercial real estate with rents and occupancies down during the recession. The sector's also facing huge amounts of debt that need to be rolled over in coming years as credit markets remain tight. Against this backdrop, Citi on Monday also offered its outlook for REIT subsectors such as retail, office and lodging companies. In retail, initial evidence that the U.S. consumer is showing ""faint signs of improvement"" is a positive sign, Bilerman said. ""We expect occupancy declines to plateau and deteriorating leasing spreads to stabilize, with retail REIT fundamentals likely bottoming in late 2010,"" he wrote. ""Following strong outperformance of the mall REITs in 2009, we now expect the shopping center REITs to outperform in 2010, though we are selective on names."" Meanwhile, in the office and industrial subsector, the analyst restated an underweight rating, citing ""high relative valuation, lagging fundamentals and our view that acquisition opportunities may take some time to play out."" Among the individual ratings changes, Citi upgraded to buy from sell six REITs: Codgell Spencer Inc. CSA, -1.99% Kilroy Realty Corp. KRC, -2.81% Kite Realty Group Trust KRG, -1.38% Public Storage Inc. PSA, -0.77% UDR Inc. UDR, -1.54% and Weingarten Realty Investors WRI, -0.61% It also lifted PS Business Parks Inc. PSB, -2.34% to hold from sell. As for downgrades, Citi lowered ratings on Highwoods Properties Inc. HIW, -2.03% Kimco Realty Corp. KIM, -0.78% and Corporate Office Properties Trust OFC, -0.81% to sell from hold.

Forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as ""may,"" ""will,"" ""should,"" ""could,"" ""believe,"" ""anticipate,"" ""expect,"" ""estimate,"" ""plan"" or other comparable terminology. Forward-looking statements are inherently subject to risks and uncertainties, many of which we cannot predict with accuracy and some of which we might not even anticipate. Although we believe that the expectations, estimates and projections reflected in such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions at the time made, we can give no assurance that these expectations, estimates and projections will be achieved. Future events and actual results may differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. Important factors that may affect these expectations, estimates and projections include, but are not limited to: general economic and business conditions, which will, among other things, affect office property and data center demand and rents, tenant creditworthiness, interest rates, financing availability and property values; adverse changes in the real estate markets, including, among other things, increased competition with other companies; governmental actions and initiatives, including risks associated with the impact of a prolonged government shutdown or budgetary reductions or impasses, such as a reduction in rental revenues, non-renewal of leases and/or a curtailment of demand for additional space by our strategic customers; our ability to borrow on favorable terms; risks of real estate acquisition and development activities, including, among other things, risks that development projects may not be completed on schedule, that tenants may not take occupancy or pay rent or that development or operating costs may be greater than anticipated; risks of investing through joint venture structures, including risks that our joint venture partners may not fulfill their financial obligations as investors or may take actions that are inconsistent with our objectives; changes in our plans for properties or views of market economic conditions or failure to obtain development rights, either of which could result in recognition of significant impairment losses; our ability to satisfy and operate effectively under Federal income tax rules relating to real estate investment trusts and partnerships; the dilutive effects of issuing additional common shares; our ability to achieve projected results; and environmental requirements. We undertake no obligation to update or supplement forward-looking statements. Occupancy and Leasing Office Properties The tables below set forth occupancy information pertaining to our portfolio of operating office properties, which included six properties owned through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture:  September 30, 2017 December 31, 2016 Occupancy rates at period end Total 93.4 % 92.1 % Defense/IT Locations: Fort Meade/BW Corridor 95.6 % 94.3 % Northern Virginia Defense/IT 88.7 % 85.0 % Lackland Air Force Base 100.0 % 100.0 % Navy Support Locations 82.5 % 72.7 % Redstone Arsenal 97.9 % 96.4 % Data Center Shells 100.0 % 100.0 % Total Defense/IT Locations 94.7 % 92.6 % Regional Office 92.4 % 95.2 % Other 29.4 % 52.9 % Average contractual annual rental rate per square foot at period end (1) $ 29.94 $ 30.16  (1) Includes estimated expense reimbursements. Amounts reported include the portion of properties owned through an unconsolidated real estate joint venture that was allocable to our ownership interest.  Rentable Occupied Square Feet Square Feet (in thousands) December 31, 2016 17,190 15,831 Square feet vacated - (316 ) Occupancy of previously vacated space in connection with new leases (1) - 412 Square feet constructed or redeveloped 839 866 Dispositions (639 ) (572 ) Square feet removed from operations for redevelopment (22 ) - Other changes 8 5 September 30, 2017 17,376 16,226  (1) Excludes occupancy of vacant square feet acquired or developed. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we completed 2.2 million square feet of leasing, including 482,000 of construction and redevelopment space, and renewed 82.4% of the square footage of our lease expirations (including the effect of early renewals). Occupancy of our Same Office Properties increased from 91.8% as of December 31, 2016 to 92.6% as of September 30, 2017. Wholesale Data Center Property Our 19.25 megawatt wholesale data center property had 16.9 megawatts leased as of September 30, 2017, a 2.0 megawatt increase relative to December 31, 2016. Results of Operations We evaluate the operating performance of our properties using NOI from real estate operations, our segment performance measure, which includes: real estate revenues and property operating expenses; and the net of revenues and property operating expenses of real estate operations owned through unconsolidated real estate joint ventures (""UJVs"") that is allocable to COPT's ownership interest (""UJV NOI allocable to COPT""). We view our NOI from real estate operations as comprising the following primary categories of operating properties: office properties continually owned and 100% operational throughout the current and prior year reporting periods, excluding properties held for sale. We define these as changes from ""Same Office Properties""; constructed or redeveloped office properties placed into service that were not 100% operational throughout the current and prior year reporting periods; our wholesale data center; properties held for sale as of September 30, 2017; and property dispositions. In addition to owning properties, we provide construction management and other services. The primary manner in which we evaluate the operating performance of our construction management and other service activities is through a measure we define as NOI from service operations, which is based on the net of the revenues and expenses from these activities. The revenues and expenses from these activities consist primarily of subcontracted costs that are reimbursed to us by customers along with a management fee. The operating margins from these activities are small relative to the revenue. We believe NOI from service operations is a useful measure in assessing both our level of activity and our profitability in conducting such operations. Since both of the measures discussed above exclude certain items includable in income before gain on sales of real estate, reliance on these measures has limitations; management compensates for these limitations by using the measures simply as supplemental measures that are considered alongside other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. A reconciliation of NOI from real estate operations and NOI from service operations to income before gain on sales of real estate reported on the consolidated statements of operations of COPT and subsidiaries is provided in Note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.

Our Same Office Properties pool consisted of 135 office properties, comprising 82.9% of our total operating office square footage as of September 30, 2017 (84.7% excluding the effect of properties held for sale). This pool of properties included the following changes from the pool used for purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 in our 2016 Annual Report on Form 10-K: the addition of four properties placed in service that were 100% operational on or before January 1, 2016 and three properties acquired in 2015; and the removal of two properties disposed, two properties reclassified to held for sale and one property reclassified as redevelopment in 2017. The decrease in tenant recoveries and other real estate operations revenue and property operating expenses from our Same Office Properties was due primarily to a decrease in operating expenses directly reimbursable from tenants. Our NOI from constructed and redeveloped properties placed in service included 14 properties placed in service in 2016 and 2017. NOI from Service Operations For the Three Months Ended September 30, 2017 2016 Variance (in thousands) Construction contract and other service revenues $ 29,786 $ 11,149 $ 18,637 Construction contract and other service expenses 28,788 10,341 18,447 NOI from service operations $ 998 $ 808 $ 190  Construction contract and other service revenue and expenses increased due primarily to a greater volume of construction activity in connection with several of our tenants. Construction contract activity is inherently subject to significant variability depending on the volume and nature of projects undertaken by us (primarily on behalf of tenants). Service operations are an ancillary component of our overall operations that typically contribute an insignificant amount of operating income relative to our real estate operations. Impairment (Recoveries) Losses The decrease in impairment losses was attributable primarily to the losses described below in our explanation for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2016. General, Administrative and Leasing Expenses General, administrative and leasing expenses decreased due primarily to our recognition in the prior period of $1.6 million in executive transition costs, representing mostly severance and termination benefits primarily in connection with executive departures. We recognized gain on sales of real estate of $1.2 million in the current period in connection with a land sale in White Marsh (discussed further in Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements). We recognized gain on sales of real estate in the prior period of $17.9 million on our sale of a 50% interest in six triple-net leased, single-tenant data center properties and $16.2 million in connection with other operating property dispositions.

Development spend excludes the value of owned land transferred to construction.   Company Information COPT is an office REIT that owns, manages, leases, develops and selectively acquires office and data center properties in locations that support the United States Government and its contractors, most of whom are engaged in national security, defense and information technology (“IT”) related activities servicing what it believes are growing, durable, priority missions (“Defense/IT Locations”). The Company also owns a portfolio of office properties located in select urban/urban-like submarkets in the Greater Washington, DC/Baltimore region with durable Class-A office fundamentals and characteristics (“Regional Office Properties”). As of December 31, 2017, the Company derived 88% of core portfolio annualized revenue from Defense/IT Locations and 12% from its Regional Office Properties. As of December 31, 2017 and including six buildings owned through an unconsolidated joint venture, COPT’s core portfolio of 156 office and data center shell properties encompassed 17.1 million square feet and was 95.1% leased. As of the same date, the Company also owned one wholesale data center with a critical load of 19.25 megawatts. Non-GAAP Measures The Company believes that the measures defined below that are not determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) are helpful to investors in measuring its performance and comparing it to that of other real estate investment trusts (“REITs”). Since these measures exclude certain items includable in their respective most comparable GAAP measures, reliance on the measures has limitations; the Company’s management compensates for these limitations by using the measures simply as supplemental measures that are weighed in balance with other GAAP and non-GAAP measures. These measures should not be used as an alternative to the respective most comparable GAAP measures when evaluating the Company’s financial performance or to cash flow from operating, investing and financing activities when evaluating its liquidity or ability to make cash distributions or pay debt service. Adjusted book’Defined as total assets presented on the Company’s consolidated balance sheet excluding the effect of cash and cash equivalents, accumulated depreciation on real estate properties, accumulated amortization of intangible assets on real estate acquisitions, accumulated amortization of deferred leasing costs, disposed properties included in assets held for sale, unconsolidated real estate joint venture cash and cash equivalents, liabilities and accumulated depreciation and amortization (of real estate intangibles and deferred leasing costs) allocable to the Company’s ownership interest in the joint venture and the effect of properties serving as collateral for debt in default that was extinguished (or that it intends to extinguish) via conveyance of such properties. Adjusted earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)’Adjusted EBITDA is net income (loss) adjusted for the effects of interest expense, depreciation and amortization, impairment losses, gain on sales of properties, gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt, net gain on unconsolidated entities, operating property acquisition costs, gain (loss) on interest rate derivatives, income taxes, business development expenses, demolition costs on redevelopment properties and executive transition costs, and excluding the effect of properties that served as collateral for debt in default that the Company extinguished via conveyance of such properties. Adjusted EBITDA also includes adjustments to net income for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to an unconsolidated real estate JV that was allocable to the Company’s ownership interest in the JV. While EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) is a universally-defined supplemental measure, Adjusted EBITDA incorporates additional adjustments for gains and losses from investing and financing activities and certain other items that the Company believes are not closely correlated to (or associated with) its operating performance. The Company believes that adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure for assessing un-levered performance, and believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to adjusted EBITDA. Basic FFO available to common share and common unit holders (“Basic FFO”)’This measure is FFO adjusted to subtract (1) preferred share dividends, (2) income attributable to noncontrolling interests through ownership of preferred units in Corporate Office Properties, L.P. (the “Operating Partnership”) or interests in other consolidated entities not owned by the Company, (3) depreciation and amortization allocable to noncontrolling interests in other consolidated entities, (4) Basic FFO allocable to restricted shares and (5) issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred shares. With these adjustments, Basic FFO represents FFO available to common shareholders and holders of common units in the Operating Partnership (“common units”). Common units are substantially similar to the Company’s common shares of beneficial interest (“common shares”) and are exchangeable into common shares, subject to certain conditions. The Company believes that Basic FFO is useful to investors due to the close correlation of common units to common shares, and believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Basic FFO. Cash net operating income (“Cash NOI”)’Defined as NOI from real estate operations adjusted to eliminate the effects of: straight-line rental adjustments, amortization of tenant incentives, amortization of acquisition intangibles included in FFO and NOI (including above- and below-market leases and above- or below-market cost arrangements), lease termination fees from tenants to terminate their lease obligations prior to the end of the agreed upon lease terms and rental revenue recognized under GAAP resulting from landlord assets funded by tenants. Cash NOI also includes adjustments to NOI from real estate operations for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to an unconsolidated real estate JV that were allocable to the Company’s ownership interest in the JV. Under GAAP, rental revenue is recognized evenly over the term of tenant leases (through straight-line rental adjustments and amortization of tenant incentives), which, given the long-term nature of its leases, does not align with the economics of when tenant payments are due to the Company under the arrangements. Also under GAAP, when a property is acquired, the Company allocates the acquisition to certain intangible components, which are then amortized into NOI over their estimated lives, even though the resulting revenue adjustments are not reflective of the Company’s lease economics. In addition, revenue from lease termination fees and tenant-funded landlord improvements, absent an adjustment from the Company, would result in large one-time lump sum amounts in Cash NOI that the Company does not believe are reflective of a property’s long-term value. The Company believes that Cash NOI is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT’s operating real estate because it makes adjustments to NOI for the above stated items to be more reflective of the economics of when tenant payments are due under the Company’s leases and the value of properties. As is the case with NOI, the measure is useful, in its opinion, in evaluating and comparing the performance of geographic segments, same-office property groupings and individual properties. The Company believes that operating income, as reported on its consolidated statements of operations, is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Cash NOI. Diluted adjusted funds from operations available to common share and common unit holders (“Diluted AFFO”)’Defined as Diluted FFO, as adjusted for comparability, adjusted for the following: (1) the elimination of the effect of (a) noncash rental revenues and property operating expenses (comprised of straight-line rental adjustments, which includes the amortization of recurring tenant incentives, and amortization of acquisition intangibles included in FFO and NOI, both of which are described under “Cash NOI” above), (b) share-based compensation, net of amounts capitalized, (c) amortization of deferred financing costs, (d) amortization of debt discounts and premiums and (e) amortization of settlements of debt hedges; and (2) replacement capital expenditures (defined below). Diluted AFFO also includes adjustments to Diluted FFO, as adjusted for comparability for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to an unconsolidated real estate JV that were allocable to the Company’s ownership interest in the JV. The Company believes that Diluted AFFO is a useful supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT because it incorporates adjustments for: certain revenue and expenses that are not associated with cash to or from the Company during the period; and certain capital expenditures for operating properties incurred during the period that do require cash outlays. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted AFFO. Diluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders (“Diluted FFO”)’Diluted FFO is Basic FFO adjusted to add back any changes in Basic FFO that would result from the assumed conversion of securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares. The computation of Diluted FFO assumes the conversion of common units in the Operating Partnership but does not assume the conversion of other securities that are convertible into common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase Diluted FFO per share in a given period. The Company believes that Diluted FFO is useful to investors because it is the numerator used to compute Diluted FFO per share, discussed below. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO. Diluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders, as adjusted for comparability (“Diluted FFO, as adjusted for comparability”)’Defined as Diluted FFO or FFO adjusted to exclude: operating property acquisition costs; gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, properties other than previously depreciated operating properties; gain or loss on early extinguishment of debt; FFO associated with properties that secured non-recourse debt on which it defaulted and, subsequently, extinguished via conveyance of such properties (including property NOI, interest expense and gains on debt extinguishment); loss on interest rate derivatives; demolition costs on redevelopment properties; executive transition costs (including separation related compensation and replacement recruitment costs for Vice President level positions and above); and accounting charges for original issuance costs associated with redeemed preferred shares. Diluted FFO, as adjusted for comparability also includes adjustments to Diluted FFO for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to an unconsolidated real estate JV that were allocable to the Company’s ownership interest in the JV. The Company believes this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO as it excludes gains and losses from certain investing and financing activities and certain other items that the Company believes are not closely correlated to (or associated with) operating performance. The adjustment for FFO associated with properties securing non-recourse debt on which the Company defaulted pertains to the periods subsequent to default on the loan’s payment terms, which was the result of the Company’s decision to not support payments on the loan since the estimated fair value of the properties was less than the loan balance. While the Company continued as the legal owner of the properties during this period, all cash flows produced by them went directly to the lender and the Company did not fund any debt service shortfalls, which included incremental additional interest under the default rate. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to this non-GAAP measure. Diluted FFO per share’Diluted FFO per share is (1) Diluted FFO divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. The computation of Diluted FFO per share assumes the conversion of common units in the Operating Partnership but does not assume the conversion of other securities that are convertible into common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase Diluted FFO per share in a given period. The Company believes that Diluted FFO per share is useful to investors because it provides investors with a further context for evaluating FFO results in the same manner that investors use earnings per share (“EPS”) in evaluating net income available to common shareholders. The Company believes that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to Diluted FFO per share. Diluted FFO per share, as adjusted for comparability’Defined as (1) Diluted FFO available to common share and common unit holders, as adjusted for comparability divided by (2) the sum of the (a) weighted average common shares outstanding during a period, (b) weighted average common units outstanding during a period and (c) weighted average number of potential additional common shares that would have been outstanding during a period if other securities that are convertible or exchangeable into common shares were converted or exchanged. The computation of this measure assumes the conversion of common units in the Operating Partnership but does not assume the conversion of other securities that are convertible into common shares if the conversion of those securities would increase the per share measure in a given period. The Company believes this to be a useful supplemental measure alongside Diluted FFO per share as it excludes gains and losses from investing and financing activities and certain other items that it believes are not closely correlated to (or associated with) operating performance. The Company believes that diluted EPS is the most directly comparable GAAP measure. Funds from operations (“FFO” or “FFO per NAREIT”)’Defined as net income computed using GAAP, excluding gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, previously depreciated operating properties and real estate-related depreciation and amortization. When multiple properties consisting of both operating and non-operating properties exist on a single tax parcel, the Company classifies all of the gains on sales of, and impairment losses on, the tax parcel as all being for previously depreciated operating properties when most of the value of the parcel is associated with operating properties on the parcel. FFO also includes adjustments to net income for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to an unconsolidated real estate JV that were allocable to the Company’s ownership interest in the JV. The Company believes that it uses the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trust’s (“NAREIT”) definition of FFO, although others may interpret the definition differently and, accordingly, its presentation of FFO may differ from those of other REITs. The Company believes that FFO is useful to management and investors as a supplemental measure of operating performance because, by excluding gains related to sales of, and impairment losses on, previously depreciated operating properties and excluding real estate-related depreciation and amortization, FFO can help one compare operating performance between periods. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to FFO. In-place adjusted EBITDA’Defined as Adjusted EBITDA, as further adjusted for: (1) the removal of NOI pertaining to properties in the quarterly periods in which such properties were sold; and (2) the addition of pro forma adjustments to NOI for properties acquired or placed into service subsequent to the commencement of a quarter made in order to reflect a full quarter of ownership/operations. The measure also includes adjustments to Adjusted EBITDA for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to an unconsolidated real estate JV that were allocable to the Company’s ownership interest in the JV. The Company believes that in-place adjusted EBITDA is a useful supplemental measure of performance for assessing unlevered performance, as further adjusted for changes in operating properties subsequent to the commencement of a quarter. The Company believes that net income is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to in-place adjusted EBITDA. Net debt’Defined as Gross debt (total outstanding debt reported per the Company’s balance sheet as adjusted to exclude net discounts and premiums and deferred financing costs), as adjusted to subtract cash and cash equivalents as of the end of the period and debt in default that was extinguished via conveyance of properties. The measure also includes adjustments to Gross debt for the effects of the items noted above pertaining to an unconsolidated real estate JV that were allocable to the Company’s ownership interest in the JV. Net debt to Adjusted book and Net debt plus preferred equity to Adjusted book’These measures divide either Net debt (defined above), or Net debt plus preferred equity, by Adjusted book (defined above). Net debt to in-place adjusted EBITDA ratio and Net debt plus preferred equity to in-place adjusted EBITDA ratio’Defined as either Net debt (defined above), or Net debt plus preferred equity, divided by in-place adjusted EBITDA (defined above) for the three month period that is annualized by multiplying by four. Net operating income from real estate operations (“NOI”)’NOI, which is a segment performance measure, includes: consolidated real estate revenues; consolidated property operating expenses; and the net of revenues and property operating expenses of real estate operations owned through an unconsolidated real estate JV that is allocable to COPT’s ownership interest in the JV. The Company believes that NOI is an important supplemental measure of operating performance for a REIT’s operating real estate because it provides a measure of the core real estate operations that is unaffected by depreciation, amortization, financing and general, administrative and leasing expenses; the Company believes this measure is particularly useful in evaluating the performance of geographic segments, same-office property groupings and individual properties. The Company believes that operating income, as reported on its consolidated statements of operations, is the most directly comparable GAAP measure to NOI. Payout ratios based on: Diluted FFO; Diluted FFO, as adjusted for comparability; and Diluted AFFO’These payout ratios are defined as (1) the sum of (a) dividends on unrestricted common shares and (b) distributions to holders of interests in the Operating Partnership and dividends on convertible preferred shares when such distributions and dividends are included in Diluted FFO divided by (2) the respective non-GAAP measures on which the payout ratios are based. Replacement capital expenditures’Replacement capital expenditures are defined as tenant improvements and incentives, building improvements and leasing costs incurred during the period for operatingproperties that are not (1) items contemplated prior to the acquisition of a property, (2) improvements associated with the expansion of a building or its improvements,(3) renovations to a building which change the underlying classification of the building (for example, from industrial to office or Class C office to Class B office) or(4) capital improvements that represent the addition of something new to the property rather than the replacement of something (for example, the addition of a new heatingand air conditioning unit that is not replacing one that was previously there). Replacement capital expenditures excludes expenditures of operating properties included indisposition plans during the period that were already sold or are held for future disposition. The measure also includes replacement capital expenditures of anunconsolidated real estate JV that were allocable to the Company’s ownership interest in the JV. For cash tenant incentives not due to the tenant for a period exceeding three monthspast the date on which such incentives were incurred, the Company recognizes such incentives as replacement capital expenditures in the periods such incentives are due to the tenant.Replacement capital expenditures, which is included in the computation of Diluted AFFO, is intended to represent non-transformative capital expenditures of existingproperties held for long-term investment. The Company believes that the excluded expenditures are more closely associated with its investing activities than the performance of itsoperating portfolio. Same-Properties’Operating office and data center shell properties continually owned and 100% operational since at least 1/1/16, excluding properties held for sale. Same-Property NOI and Same-Property Cash NOI’Defined as NOI, or Cash NOI, from real estate operations of Same-Properties. The Company believes that these are important supplemental measures of operating performance of Same-Properties for the same reasons discussed above for NOI from real estate operations and Cash NOI.
