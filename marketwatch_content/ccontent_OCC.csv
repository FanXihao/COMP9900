CIT Group CIT, -0.39% a commercial lender and insurer that was spun off from Tyco in 2002, is moving ahead with plans to cut debt costs and refocus its investments, says Barron's. A short ownership by Tyco tainted CIT's debt ratings yet Chief Executive Albert Gamper says its balance sheet was better after leaving Tyco than when it was purchased in 2001, thanks to $1 billion injected to help CIT drop underperforming investments. Now, says Barron's, CIT hopes to raise its performance by refinancing about $7 billion of long-term debt, saving $100 million a year. Also, the company's lending will expand to include leases of rail cars and equipment used by small businesses. One such venture already partners with Dell Computer to finance sales. Barron's says CIT shares trade at about 11 times estimated 2004 earnings compared to a 13 multiple for other financial companies in the S&P 500.

With shares closing Friday at $20.39, Barron's says the company's cash and equivalents total $12 a share. Most of that is from its 21 percent holding in Net2Phone NTOP and proceeds from shares of that company that were sold. IDT also has stakes in film and animation production, telecom hookups for businesses and a plan to wire money overseas via prepaid debit cards. Wall Street has withheld applause, says Barron's, because IDT is still posting net losses. But the company expects profitability starting in February 2004. Metropolitan Mortgage & Securities MPDPR and an affiliate, Summit Securities SGMPR both said late Friday that they will delist their preferred shares on the American Exchange so they can be traded over the counter. Summit said it will not file its 10-K annual report by a Dec. 29 deadline and expects to file it no sooner than Feb. 4 because it believes its losses were larger than reported in its June 30 10-Q filing. Metropolitan subsidiary Western United Life Assurance Co. WUCPR which said it had $1.7 billion in assets as of June 30, will be placed under voluntary supervision of the state insurance commissioner of Washington state to reassure policy holders and shareholders.

Two subsidiaries of Summit Securities, Old Standard Life Insurance and its affiliate Old West Annuity & Life, will be under voluntary supervision of the Arizona and Idaho departments of insurance.

Peoples Bancorp PEBO, -1.27% said late Friday that it will take a fourth-quarter pretax loss of $1.9 million, or 12 cents a share, as a result of selling about $55 million of mortgage-backed securities because of the high rate of prepayments by borrowers who had refinanced.

OCC,"Editor's note: This story contains corrections to an earlier version. See details. SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) - Earlier this year, Jim Oberweis, Jr. couldn't drum up much interest among sullen investors for his aggressive small-growth stock mutual fund. But now the gloom is off the small-stock rose. ""It's a whole 'nother world,"" says Oberweis, manager of the Oberweis Emerging Growth fund OBEGX, +1.07% ""Buying profitable high-growth companies trading at reasonable valuations is very much in favor."" Indeed, small-growth stocks are leading the charge in a snapback rally that many investors still can't believe is real. And some sharp-eyed small-growth fund managers have been enjoying the wild ride. ""The money is being made in the small-cap stocks,"" says J. Taylor Brown, vice president at The Hirsch Organization, publisher of the Stock Trader's Almanac. ""This isn't the end of the bull market; we haven't come full cycle yet."" In just eight months, the Russell 2000 has gained 37.3 percent, while the Dow DJIA, -1.44% is up 26 percent. Small-cap growth stocks are experiencing an even stronger revival. While small-cap value held its own through the bear market - the Russell 2000 Value index gained a cumulative 25.4 percent in the three years ended in December - the Russell 2000 Growth index slid 62 percent in that same period. It's soared 40.3 percent since October, recouping more than a third of its bear-market losses. Investors should consider keeping about 15 percent of their portfolio in small-cap stocks, says Mark Balasa, a financial adviser with Balasa, Dinverno, Foltz & Hoffman in Schaumburg, Ill. He now recommends a 25 percent allocation, down from a recent 30 percent when small-caps were cheaper. Most individual shareholders are better off investing in small-caps through mutual funds, Balasa says. ""It's a very inefficient market, and the premium in terms of real return can be given back by trading costs."" With that in mind, we screened Morningstar's Principia database for the 15 small-growth funds with the biggest gains since the October market lows. To qualify, funds needed at least $1 million in assets and a retail shareholder base. Beyond that, all that mattered was absolute performance on a load-adjusted basis. The funds that passed this screen can be extremely volatile and are capable of stellar gains and stunning losses - such is the nature of small-stock investing. See related story. Even PBHG Emerging Growth is back on the top-performing list, up 45.1 percent since the October lows -- but in the three years through December it lost a total of 105.4 percent Top-ranked Polynous Growth A PAGFX is up 104.8 percent in the past eight months, but lost 40.7 percent in 2002. More tellingly, manager Kevin Wenck has 35 percent of this eclectic $8 million fund committed to a single stock: Optical Cable Corp. OCC, -4.67% which manufacturers fiberoptic cable to upgrade business systems. Shares have almost tripled year-to-date, but Wenck says Optical Cable still trades at roughly one-third the value of competitor Corning GLW, -2.19% Another 30 percent of the Polynous fund is in cash, when 10 percent is more typical. ""Stocks hit target prices and they get sold, and nothing comes along to replace them,"" Wenck explains. ""That's usually a pretty good indicator that maybe things have gone too far, too fast."" Most small-cap funds broadly diversify across stocks and market sectors, if only to minimize the risk of any one investment going wrong. The Oberweis portfolio, for example, has about 60 holdings, spread among nine major market sectors, according to Morningstar. And for all the recent trouble Oberweis had attracting investors, it turns out that his fund has been one of the small-growth rally's best performers. ""This is SO much fun,"" Oberweis writes in the current issue of the monthly Oberweis Report newsletter. The $87 million Emerging Growth fund is up 55.7 percent since the depths of the small-stock sell-off last October. Sibling Oberweis Micro Cap OBMCX, +1.68% recently closed to new investors after its assets surged above $90 million. And while some small-cap investors are turning cautious, Oberweis predicts that small stocks could be breaking out into a multi-year rally. As more buyers come into the market, he says, demand grows for a limited supply of shares. ""The natural tendency is for this to fuel itself,"" Oberweis adds. ""It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.""

The online media company didn't provide specifics as to what jobs would be cut, or when the staff reductions would take place. The company did not comment beyond restating its goal to reach operating profitability in the fourth quarter. The company is set to announce results on Jan. 30, after the close of trading. The stock ended the regular session Monday up 1.8 percent. Intel (INTC: news, chart, profile) will report its fourth-quarter results after Tuesday's closing bell.

Robert Avery, the chipmaker's corporate director of finance, is to assume Colvin's duties until a permanent replacement can be found. Bionx Implants BINX soared almost 41 percent after the maker of implants for orthopedic applications said it had agreed to be acquired by Conmed CNMD, -1.99% for $48 million, or $4.35 a share. The bid represented a 45 percent premium over Friday's closing price, but a 29-percent discount to its 52-week high of $6.10. Conmed expects the deal to be financed from its revolving credit facility. It anticipates closing the deal in the next four months. Broadwing BRW, +0.82% rose nearly 8 percent after the company said financing commitments increased to $350 million from $200 million in the previous month, and said it has initiated discussions with its agent banks over a comprehensive amendment to the terms of its credit facility.

Cholestech CTEC, +0.73% advanced 28 percent after Adams Harkness & Hill boosted its rating on shares of the Hayward, Calif., provider of medical diagnostic testing products and services to ""buy"" from ""market perform.""

Analyst Rob Schwartz said he expects deferred revenue and backlog to increase ""because of seven-figure deals that closed at the end of the quarter."" Coinstar CSTR, -4.06% jumped nearly 11 percent after the Bellevue, Wash., coin-counting firm said that earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization for its North American operations would come in at the high end of its range of $50 million to $51.5 million in 2002. The company sees 2002 revenue for North America at roughly $149.6 million. Earnings per share and net income from continuing operations for North America are projected at the high end of previous estimates of 95 cents to $1 per share, and $21.5 million to $23 million, respectively. Coinstar also said that it expects to record a fourth-quarter gain of $42.6 million, or $1.87 per share from its recognition of deferred tax assets. Covad Communications COVD gained almost 15 percent after Kaufman Bros. released a research note reiterating its ""buy"" rating on the shares. Kaufman said it expects Covad to pre-release operating statistics for the fourth quarter after Monday's closing bell, or Tuesday morning. The firm expects the company to meet its outlook for net subscriber additions of 20,000 to 25,000. It also believes Covad will beat its outlook for EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of $25 million in the period. ""Accelerating growth should attract a new round of investors to the stock, as growth has been a missing key ingredient to the Covad story without which the company cannot prove its model is viable,"" Kaufman said. Endwave ENWV rose more than 41 percent after the provider of radio frequency subsystems raised its fourth-quarter revenue outlook. The company now anticipates revenue of $6.6 million to $6.9 million for the quarter ending December, up from a previous forecast of $5 million to $6 million.

Motorola holds 74 percent of Next Level's common stock. The offer values Next Level shares at $1.04 each. Shares of Numerical Technologies NMTC, +0.00% leapt almost 87 percent after the provider of sub-wavelength integrated circuit technology announced an agreement to be acquired by Synopsys SNPS, -2.03% for about $250 million, or $7 a share in cash. That represents an 89 percent premium to Friday's closing price, but a 76 percent discount to its 52-week high ($29.75). Synopsys said it expects the acquisition, which is expected to close in the first quarter, to be dilutive to fiscal 2003 earnings by less than 10 cents a share, then accretive to fiscal 2004 results. Optical Cable OCC, -4.67% gained nearly 13 percent after the Roanoke, Va., fiber optic cable firm said that it has repurchased more than 21 percent of its outstanding common stock in a privately negotiated transaction.

Including items, the company earned $315 million, or 64 cents a share, up from its year-ago profit of $89 million, or 18 cents a share. Revenue rose 11.3 percent in the latest three months to $3.79 billion from $3.39 billion in the same period a year earlier. The company said, however, that its second-quarter results ""are not indicative of what we expect beginning with the third quarter, given the new Medicare outlier policy we've volunteered to adopt as of Jan. 1. Looking ahead, the company forecast fiscal 2003 earnings of $2.40 to $2.60 per share, below its previous outlook for a profit of $2.38 to $2.78 per share. The lower outlook reflects the company's voluntary adoption of a new outlier policy last week and share repurchases. Monday decliners CryoLife CRY, -2.74% fell more than 6 percent after the company said that its interim agreement with the Food and Drug Administration has been renewed. The move allows CryoLife to distribute non-valved cardiac and vascular tissue processed prior to Sept. 5, 2002 for an additional 45 working days, or until March 20. For equivalent tissue processed since Sept. 5, CryoLife isn't required ""to obtain physician prescriptions, label the tissue as subject to a recall, or require special steps regarding procurement agency records of donor screening and testing beyond those required for all processors of human tissue."" The company said it continues to work with the FDA toward a full resolution of issues that led to the recall of certain tissue transplant products. Duke Energy DUK, -0.15% dropped almost 15 percent after the company warned that 2002 earnings would fall short of a previously given range due to the slump in the merchant energy sector and the economy overall. The company said in October that earnings for the year would be at the low end of the projected range of $1.95 to $2.05 a share, but now believes it will earn closer to $1.85 a share. The company added that 2003 earnings would come in between $1.35 to $1.60 a share, well below the average analyst estimate compiled by Multex of $1.84. Separately, the energy company said it would take total charges of approximately 65 cents a share for the year related to ice storm damage, restructuring and asset impairment. Georgia-Pacific GP, +0.00% lost nearly 8 percent after the company warned that continuing operations would break even in the fourth quarter. The suspension of production at some manufacturing facilities and competitive lumber pricing hurt results. Competitive market conditions and higher manufacturing costs also hurt its North American consumer products business. Analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call had been expecting the paper company to earn 22 cents a share, on average, in the quarter ending December. Separately, G-P said it would take a charge of $315 million in the fourth quarter for asbestos liabilities and defense costs. Hibbett Sporting Goods HIBB, +0.21% fell almost 11 percent after BB&T Capital Markets lowered its rating on shares of the Birmingham, Ala., retailer to ""buy"" from ""strong buy.""

Saks SKS, +0.75% gave almost 6 percent after the company was downgraded by J.P. Morgan to ""underweight"" from ""neutral."" The broker cited tough comparisons in 2003 and the stock's ""full-looking"" valuation. J.P. Morgan said it remained cautious on the department store chain's fundamental outlook, given its poor operating history and weak industry positioning. Standex SXI, +1.57% lost more than 8 percent after the Salem, N.H., manufacturing firm warned that it expects second-quarter results to be hurt the impact of a weak consumer market and soft holiday sales on its consumer group operations. The company now sees earnings of 29 to 33 cents a share in the period, including items. In the same period a year earlier, Standex earned 52 cents per share. ""Revenues for the Consumer Group are down 10 percent for the quarter compared with the second quarter last year resulting in the projected earnings decline,"" said Roger Fix, the company's president, in a press release after Friday's closing bell.

The lights haven't turned on just yet as Wenck's Polynous Growth Fund PAGFX with over $6 million in assets under management, has struggled with a 27-percent year-to-date pullback while the S&P 500 has shed 16 percent. Over the last three years, his fund has lost 8 percent while the S&P 500 has fallen nearly 2 percent. ""Polynous' overall emphasis is on growth stocks,"" Wenck said.

His first pick, Optical Cable OCC, -4.67% makes up almost 20 percent of the fund. As Wenck pointed out, ""You hear the words 'optical cable' and you feel like gagging? All you can imagine is the glut of cable running from Seattle to Chicago with 6 percent getting used."" But the bulk of Optical Cable's revenue comes from internal enterprise usage in markets that seem to be doing just fine, he said. ""The company has historically been profitable, it's always been cash flow positive, and it's had no debt."" Its shares fell 5 cents to 56 cents on Friday. Next up, VeriSign VRSN, -1.98% While Wenck admits a chunk its business comes from the deteriorating market of domain registration, he likes the fact that two-thirds of sales stems from ""plumbing the Internet and telecom systems."" And that the stock has been ""obliterated"" only makes its case more compelling. Verisign fell 4 cents to $9.08. His last pick is Able Laboratories ABLA Wenck sees a bright future for this generic drug manufacturer as the company has 15 new drug applications on file that he says are ""about to be acted on by the FDA."" The last year and a half has been especially good for Able, as Wenck sees it. ""The company was probably within a couple days of going out of business before the approvals started coming in."" Its shares fell 6 cents to $5.60.

Summary of Company Performance for First Quarter of Fiscal Year 2018 ? Net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 were $17.6 million, an increase of 20.2% compared to net sales of $14.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, and a sequential increase of 2.0% compared to net sales of $17.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. ? As of January 31, 2018, our sales order backlog/forward load was $14.8 million, or approximately 11 to 12 weeks of net sales (on a trailing 12 month basis). At the end of February 2018, our sales order backlog/forward load further increased to $19.0 million, or approximately 14 to 15 weeks of net sales (on a trailing 12 month basis), as compared to our sales order backlog/forward load that varies throughout the year, but is generally between approximately 3 to 4 weeks of net sales, or approximately $4 million to $5 million. As a result, at this time we believe it is likely we will see a significant positive impact on net sales during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to the same period last year. ? Gross profit increased 8.7% to $5.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $4.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. ? Gross profit margin (gross profit as a percentage of net sales) was 29.8% during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to 32.9% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Table of Contents ? Net loss was $410,000, or $0.06 per share, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $616,000, or $0.09 per share, for the comparable period last year. Results of Operations We sell our products internationally and domestically to our customers, which include major distributors, various regional and smaller distributors, original equipment manufacturers and value-added resellers. All of our sales to customers outside of the United States are denominated in U.S. dollars. We can experience fluctuations in the percentage of net sales to customers outside of the United States and in the United States from period to period based on the timing of large orders, coupled with the impact of increases and decreases in sales to customers in various regions of the world. Sales outside of the U.S. can also be impacted by fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar compared to other currencies. Net sales consist of gross sales of products by the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis less discounts, refunds and returns. Revenue is recognized at the time of product shipment or delivery to the customer (including distributors) provided that the customer takes ownership and assumes risk of loss (based on shipping terms), collection of the relevant receivable is probable, persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable. Our customers generally do not have the right of return unless a product is defective or damaged and is within the parameters of the product warranty in effect for the sale. Cost of goods sold consists of the cost of materials, product warranty costs and compensation costs, and overhead and other costs related to our manufacturing operations. The largest percentage of costs included in cost of goods sold is attributable to costs of materials. Our gross profit margin percentages are heavily dependent upon product mix on a quarterly basis and may vary based on changes in product mix. To the extent not negatively impacted by product mix, gross profit margins tend to be higher when we achieve higher net sales levels, as certain fixed manufacturing costs are spread over higher sales. Hybrid cables (fiber and copper) with higher copper content tend to have lower gross profit margins. Selling, general and administrative expenses (""SG&A expenses"") consist of the compensation costs for sales and marketing personnel, shipping costs, trade show expenses, customer support expenses, travel expenses, advertising, bad debt expense, the compensation costs for administration and management personnel, legal, accounting, advisory and professional fees, costs incurred to settle litigation or claims and other actions against us, and other costs associated with our operations. Royalty income (expense), net consists of royalty income earned on licenses associated with our patented products, net of royalty and related expenses. Amortization of intangible assets consists of the amortization of the costs, including legal fees, associated with internally developed patents that have been granted. Amortization of intangible assets is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets. Other income (expense), net consists of interest expense and other miscellaneous income and expense items not directly attributable to our operations. Table of Contents The following table sets forth and highlights fluctuations in selected line items from our condensed consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated: Three Months Ended  January 31, Percent 2018 2017 Change Net sales $ 17,551,000 $ 14,606,000 20.2 % Gross profit 5,229,000 4,810,000 8.7 % SG&A expenses 5,558,000 5,193,000 7.0 % Net loss (410,000 ) (616,000 ) 33.4 %  Three Months Ended January 31, 2018 and 2017 Net Sales Consolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 increased 20.2% to $17.6 million compared to net sales of $14.6 million for the same period last year. Sequentially, consolidated net sales increased 2.0% compared to net sales of $17.2 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017. We experienced an increase in net sales in our specialty markets in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the same period last year, particularly in our military and wireless carrier markets. This increase in the specialty markets was partially offset by a decrease in net sales in our enterprise markets. Net sales to customers outside of the United States increased 32.1% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to the same period last year, and net sales to customers in the United States increased 17.3% compared to the same period last year. During our first fiscal quarter of 2018, we experienced an increase in our sales order backlog/forward load-particularly for our fiber optic cable products. Generally, OCC's consolidated sales order backlog/forward load varies throughout the year between approximately 3 to 4 weeks of net sales, or approximately $4 million to $5 million. As of January 31, 2018, our sales order backlog/forward load was $14.8 million, or approximately 11 to 12 weeks of net sales (on a trailing 12 month basis). At the end of February 2018, our sales order backlog/forward load further increased to $19.0 million, or approximately 14 to 15 weeks of net sales (on a trailing 12 month basis). As a result of our elevated sales order backlog/forward load, at this time, we believe it is likely we will see a significant positive impact on net sales during the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to the same period last year. Our current sales order backlog/forward load includes orders for hybrid fiber optic cable products with high copper content. Certain of these particular orders are for hybrid products that tend to have lower gross profit margins. Gross Profit Our gross profit increased to $5.2 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, an increase of 8.7% compared to gross profit of $4.8 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was 29.8% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to 32.9% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Our gross profit margin percentages are heavily dependent upon product mix on a quarterly basis. Gross profit margin in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was negatively impacted primarily due to a shift in product mix toward the sale of certain lower margin products in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Table of Contents Selling, General, and Administrative Expenses SG&A expenses increased 7.0% to $5.6 million during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $5.2 million for the same period last year. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 31.7% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to 35.6% in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The increase in SG&A expenses during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the same period last year was primarily the result of increased employee related costs totaling $375,000. Compensation costs have increased largely as a result of new hires, selectively added to accomplish long-term strategic objectives, and increases in commissions due to increases in net sales in the first quarter of fiscal 2018, as compared to the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Royalty Income (Expense), Net We recognized royalty income, net of royalty and related expenses, totaling $5,000 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to royalty expense, net of royalty income, totaling $31,000 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The change when comparing the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 to the same period last year is due to the expiration of a patent in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 for a previously licensed product sold by OCC. We expect the trend of royalty income to offset royalty expense to continue in fiscal year 2018. Amortization of Intangible Assets We recognized $7,000 of amortization expense, associated with intangible assets, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $6,000 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Other Expense, Net We recognized other expense, net in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 of $119,000 compared to $217,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Other expense, net is comprised primarily of interest expense together with other miscellaneous items which may fluctuate from period to period. The decrease in other expense, net during the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to the decrease in the interest rates, effective in fiscal year 2017, of our real estate term loans and revolving credit note. Loss Before Income Taxes We reported a loss before income taxes of $450,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $636,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. The improvement was primarily due to the increase in gross profit of $418,000, partially offset by the increase in SG&A expenses of $365,000, compared to the same period in 2017. Income Tax Benefit Income tax benefit totaled $39,000 in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, compared to $21,000 for the same period in fiscal year 2017. Our effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was 8.8% compared to 3.2% for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. Fluctuations in our effective tax rates are primarily due to permanent differences in U.S. GAAP and tax accounting for various tax deductions and benefits, but can also be significantly different from the statutory tax rate when income or loss before taxes is at a level such that permanent differences in U.S. GAAP and tax accounting treatment have a disproportional impact on the projected effective tax rate. Table of Contents During fiscal year 2015, we established a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets. As a result of establishing a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets, if we generate sufficient taxable income in subsequent periods to realize a portion or all of our net deferred tax assets, our effective income tax rate could be unusually low due to the tax benefit attributable to the necessary decrease in our valuation allowance. Further, if we generate losses before taxes in subsequent periods, as we did in the first quarter of fiscal year 2018, our effective income tax rate could also be unusually low as any increase in our net deferred tax asset from such a net operating loss for tax purposes would be offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. If we generate sufficient income before taxes in future periods such that U.S. GAAP would permit us to conclude that the removal of any valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset is appropriate, then during the period in which such determination is made, we will recognize the non-cash benefit of such removal of the valuation allowance in income tax expense on our consolidated statement of operations, which will increase net income and will also increase the net deferred tax asset on our consolidated balance sheet. If we do not generate sufficient income before taxes in future periods such that U.S. GAAP would permit us to conclude that the reduction or removal of any valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset is appropriate, then no such non-cash benefit would be realized. There can be no assurance regarding any future realization of the benefit by us of all or part of our net deferred tax assets. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the ""Tax Act""), enacted on December 22, 2017, lowers the statutory federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. The reduction of the statutory federal corporate tax rate to 21% became effective on January 1, 2018. Because our fiscal year 2018 commenced on November 1, 2017, the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate applicable to fiscal year 2018 is a blended rate of 23.2%. Beginning in our 2019 fiscal year, the annual statutory federal corporate tax rate will be 21%. As a result of the reduction in the federal corporate tax rate, we remeasured our net deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance in the period that includes the enactment date of the Tax Act, resulting in a reduction of $1.3 million in both our net deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance. The use of a blended rate may result in further adjustment to the remeasurement of the net deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, when the annual results are finalized and the annual change in gross temporary differences are determined. Because we decreased both our net deferred tax assets and our valuation allowance by the same amount, there was no impact on our results of operations from the remeasurement. Any future benefit we may realize from our net deferred tax assets is effectively reduced by $1.3 million, adjusted for any changes that may be recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2018, as a result of the remeasurement. As of October 31, 2017, prior to the enactment of the Tax Act, our valuation allowance totaled $3.6 million, completely offsetting our net deferred tax assets. Net Loss Net loss for the first quarter of fiscal year 2018 was $410,000 compared to $616,000 for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. This improvement was primarily due to the decrease in loss before income taxes of $187,000. Financial Condition Total assets increased $2.5 million, or 6.2%, to $42.6 million at January 31, . . .

OCC,"NEW YORK, Jan. 10, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Read the full report: https://www.reportlinker.com/p05281139    Report Details Fibre optics is the technology used to transmit information through very fine glass or plastic optical fibres from one source to another. The information is transmitted through the optical cables as rapid pulses of light. The receiving end of a fibre optic transmission translates the light pulses into binary values. Fibre optics have advantages such as increased bandwidth; electromagnetic interference immunity; decreased cost, size, and weight; low attenuation rate; electrical isolation; and data security.  Fibre optics are mostly used in various communications applications such as telecoms, premises, utility, CATV, military, and industrial. Fibre optics are also employed in non-communications applications such as sensors and fibre optic lighting. Fibre optics-based sensors are used for measuring physical quantities such as temperature and pressure in industrial applications. Optical sensors are used for detecting faults and failures during industrial operations.  Visiongain assesses that the global fibre optic market will reach $3.3bn in 2017 and the demand for fibre optics is expected to witness a high growth during the forecast period. The increasing demand for internet and growing FTTx are driving the market.

OCC,"ROANOKE, Va., Sept. 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Optical Cable Corporation OCC, -4.39% (""OCC [®] "" or the ""Company"") today announced financial results for its third quarter ended July 31, 2017. Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results Consolidated net sales for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $16.4 million, a 2.9% decrease, compared to net sales of $16.9 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016, primarily resulting from weakness in the enterprise markets during the third quarter.  The Company increased net sales in its specialty markets in the third quarter of fiscal 2017, compared to the same period last year, overcoming continued weakness in the military portion of its specialty markets.  The increase in net sales in specialty markets achieved was not sufficient to overcome the decrease in net sales in enterprise markets.  Sequentially, net sales continued to grow in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, increasing 3.7% compared to net sales of $15.8 million in the prior quarter.  Net sales in the third quarter increased 12.5% as compared to net sales of $14.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017.  The Company saw some improvement in net sales to customers outside of the United States, with an increase of 1.2% in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017 compared to the same period last year.  Net sales to customers in the United States decreased 3.8% compared to the same period last year.  Gross profit was $5.3 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, a decrease of 2.9% compared to gross profit of $5.5 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.  Gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, was 32.3% in the third quarters of both fiscal years 2017 and 2016.  SG&A expenses increased 6.9% to $5.4 million during the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to $5.1 million for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.  The increase in SG&A expenses during the third quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to increases in employee related costs intended to grow future sales into the next fiscal year.  OCC recorded a net loss of $295,000, or $0.05 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to net income of $188,000, or $0.03 per basic and diluted share, for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016.  Fiscal Year-to-Date 2017 Financial Results Consolidated net sales were $46.9 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2017, a slight decrease compared to net sales of $47.3 million for the same period in fiscal 2016.  The Company experienced slight decreases in net sales in both its enterprise and specialty markets in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, compared to the same period last year. Net sales to customers in the United States increased less than one percent in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, compared to the same period last year, while net sales to customers outside of the United States decreased 6.7% compared to the same period last year.  During the first nine months of fiscal 2017, net sales outside of the United States was negatively impacted by a strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly in certain geographic regions.     Gross profit increased 16.7% to $15.8 million in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, compared to $13.5 million in the first nine months of fiscal 2016.  Gross profit margin increased to 33.7% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, compared to 28.6% in the first nine months of fiscal year 2016.  Gross profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2017 was positively impacted by a shift in product mix toward certain higher margin products. SG&A expenses increased 6.5% to $16.5 million during the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, compared to $15.5 million for the same period last year.  The increase in SG&A expenses during the first nine months of fiscal 2017, compared to the same period last year, was primarily due to increases in employee related costs, legal fees, and marketing expenses.  OCC recorded a net loss attributable to the Company of $1.2 million, or $0.18 per basic and diluted share, for the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, compared to a net loss of $2.5 million, or $0.40 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year.  Management's Comments Neil Wilkin, President and Chief Executive Officer of OCC, said, ""During the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, OCC significantly improved gross profit and bottom line performance.  After strengthening in the first half of the year, net sales were weaker in our enterprise markets during the third quarter. We believe this market weakness is temporary. In our third quarter, we continued taking steps to improve long-term performance, including executing on sales and business development efforts, as well as product innovation. These efforts have helped us increase net sales in the past two consecutive quarters, despite weakness in certain of our specialty markets. We are confident that these efforts will drive future growth and enhance shareholder value.""

OCC,"ROANOKE, Va., June 13, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Optical Cable Corporation OCC, -4.39% (""OCC [®] "" or the ""Company"") today announced financial results for its second quarter ended April 30, 2017. Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results Consolidated net sales for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017 were $15.8 million, a 3.0% decrease compared to net sales of $16.3 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.  The Company experienced an increase in net sales in its specialty markets in the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year, despite significant weakness in the military and the wireless carrier portions of its specialty markets.  The net increase in net sales in specialty markets was offset by a decrease in net sales in enterprise markets.  Sequentially, net sales increased 8.5% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to net sales of $14.6 million for the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, with increases in both the Company's enterprise and specialty markets. Net sales to customers in the United States decreased 3.0% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to the same period last year, and net sales to customers outside of the United States decreased 3.3% compared to the same period last year.  Net sales outside the U.S. continue to be negatively impacted by a strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly in certain geographic regions.  Gross profit increased 24.4% to $5.7 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to $4.6 million in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.  Sequentially, gross profit increased 17.7% in the second quarter compared to the first quarter of fiscal 2017. Gross profit margin, or gross profit as a percentage of net sales, increased to 35.7% compared to 27.9% in the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.  Gross profit margin was positively impacted by a shift in product mix toward certain higher margin products.  SG&A expenses increased 10.2% to $5.9 million during the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to $5.4 million for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016.  The increase in SG&A expenses during the second quarter of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to increases in employee related costs, legal fees, and marketing expenses. OCC recorded a net loss attributable to the Company of $239,000, or $0.04 per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, compared to a net loss attributable to the Company of $983,000, or $0.15 per basic and diluted share, for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016. Fiscal Year-to-Date 2017 Financial Results Consolidated net sales for the first half of fiscal 2017 increased slightly to $30.5 million, compared to net sales of $30.4 million for the same period in fiscal 2016.  The Company experienced an increase in net sales in its enterprise markets in the first half of fiscal year 2017, compared to the same period last year, but this increase was partially offset by a decrease in net sales in the Company's specialty markets as a result of significant decreases in the military and the wireless carrier potions of its specialty markets. Net sales to customers in the United States increased 3.2% in the first half of fiscal year 2017, compared to the same period last year, while net sales to customers outside of the United States decreased 10.5% compared to the same period last year.  During the first half of fiscal 2017, net sales outside of the United States continued to be negatively impacted by a strong U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, particularly in certain geographic regions. Gross profit increased 30.0% to $10.5 million in the first half of fiscal year 2017, compared to $8.1 million in the first half of fiscal 2016.  Gross profit margin increased to 34.4% in the first half of fiscal year 2017, compared to 26.5% in the first half of fiscal year 2016.  Gross profit margin for the first half of fiscal 2017 was positively impacted by a shift in product mix toward certain higher margin products. SG&A expenses increased 6.2% to $11.1 million during the first half of fiscal year 2017, compared to $10.4 million for the same period last year.  The increase in SG&A expenses during the first half of fiscal 2017 compared to the same period last year was primarily due to increases in employee related costs, legal fees, and marketing expenses.  OCC recorded a net loss attributable to the Company of $855,000, or $0.13 per basic and diluted share, for the first half of fiscal year 2017, compared to a net loss of $2.7 million, or $0.43 per basic and diluted share, for the same period last year. Loan Modification Agreement OCC entered into a Third Loan Modification Agreement with the Bank of North Carolina on April 27, 2017, revising the fixed interest rates for its two term loans, lowering the applicable repayment installments and extending the maturity date to May 1, 2024.  The two term loans were previously scheduled to expire on April 30, 2018.  Management's Comments Neil Wilkin, President and Chief Executive Officer of OCC, said, ""We are pleased to have increased gross profit and improved the Company's bottom line during the second quarter and fiscal year-to-date periods.
