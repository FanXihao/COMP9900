ACP,"In the immediate aftermath of the financial crisis, investors were quick to seize on the potential of junk bonds. After all, there weren’t a lot of good places to find yield, and equities seemed plenty risky, so why not cross your fingers, hope against defaults and collect 8% to 10% a year? Talk of a junk-bond bubble arose as early as the beginning of 2011, after the high-yield bond market surged 85% from its Great Recession lows. But junk defied gravity, and investors were lulled into a false sense of security. And at the end of 2015, the bottom fell out. I think the rise and fall of junk is illustrated pretty well by the story of the AdvisorShares Peritus High Yield ETF HYLD, +0.08% This junk ETF was launched at the end of 2010 after most of the rebound was already priced into high-yield bonds and there was feverish demand. The ETF moved mostly sideways and threw off roughly double-digit yields for almost four years, but is down about 20% in the past six months as the junk-bond market has imploded. Of course, it’s easy to kick around junk bonds and the investors who chased yield. But as the saying goes, the time to be greedy is when others are fearful, and while there may be legitimate reasons to be cautious about high-yield bonds with ugly credit ratings, it’s worth considering the opportunity in this unloved asset class as we enter 2016. Here’s why junk may not be as trashy as you think right now. Don’t confuse fund closures with defaults Investors have good reason to be skeptical after the Third Avenue Focused Credit Fund blocked redemptions in December until it could find a way to unwind itself, and a fund operated by Lucidus Capital Partners was forced to liquidate its entire $900 million portfolio to satisfy redemption demands. But let’s not confuse investors demanding their money back all at once with the underlying value of these assets crashing to pennies on the dollar. In fact, we saw this kind of turmoil in junk before, most notably with the Charles Schwab High Yield Plus mutual fund during the financial crisis. Yes, managers made an unfortunate decision to invest as much as half the fund in mortgage-backed securities. And they were criminally stupid to market the fund as a “safe as cash” holding for investors. But the problem that ultimately doomed the Schwab fund wasn’t the 25% drop in market value; it was a race for the exits as investors pulled about $12 billion, or almost 90% of assets, from the fund in about a year’s time. The painful irony is that while investors successfully sued Schwab and in 2010 won $200 million in damages for their collective troubles, the junk-bond market came roaring back. Surely there is a lesson here about bad bond managers building shaky portfolios, and the whole “buyer beware” thing that we all have heard ad nauseam about any asset class. But it’s worth wondering if this doomed Schwab fund that became representative of the financial crisis to so many would actually have been kinder to investors if they had just held on for a few more years instead of demanding redemptions all at once. Or more to the point, it’s worth wondering if you should considering buying junk now when everyone is fleeing, particularly via a closed-end fund that is not subject to the same rush for redemptions as an open-end mutual fund. Three such closed-end junk funds trading at double-digit discounts as of Dec. 31 are the AllianceBernstein Global High Income Fund AWF, +0.34% the Avenue Income Credit Strategies Closed-End Fund ACP, -0.22% and the Babson Capital Global Short Duration High Yield Fund BGH, +0.81% PREV PAGE 1 2 NEXT PAGE","Jan 4, 2016 9:58 a.m. ET",1,"Junk bonds, after a tumultuous 2015, are now alluring",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/junk-bonds-after-a-tumultuous-2015-are-now-alluring-2016-01-04
