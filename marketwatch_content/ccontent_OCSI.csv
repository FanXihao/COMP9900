OCSI,"Bloomberg NEW YORK (MarketWatch) – Fifth Street Asset Management said Wednesday it is postponing its initial public offering, citing continued volatility and difficult conditions in the equity markets. The credit-focused asset manager with nearly $6 billion under management did not offer any possible timing for another attempt at a listing. “While we received demand from potential investors, market conditions are not optimal for an IPO at this time,” Chief Executive Leonard M. Tannenbaum said in a statement. The recent wild swings in the market, fueled by global growth concerns, tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East and Ebola fears, has many companies thinking twice about going public. Seven other companies have pulled their IPOs this month, according to data from Dealogic. Fifth Street Asset Management was planning to offer 8 million shares of common stock at a price range of $24 to $26 a share. The Greenwich, Connecticut-based company was supposed to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol FSAM. Two other asset managers that completed IPOs this year are currently trading below their issue price. Shares of Ares Management LP ARES, +0.23%  , which went public in May, were last trading at $16.80, 11.6% below their issue price of $19 a share. Shares of Medley Management Inc. MDLY, -0.88%  , which went public in September, were trading at $16.72, 7.2% below their issue price of $18. Tannenbaum, a former equity analyst at Merrill Lynch, founded the Fifth Street entities in 1998. Fifth Street Asset Management has two publicly-traded business development companies, Fifth Street Finance Corp. US:FSC   and Fifth Street Floating Rate Corp. US:FSFR  . BDCs invest in the debt of smaller companies and are sometimes compared to venture capital fund. as they serve growth-stage businesses that may otherwise find it difficult to access capital. Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, RBC Capital Markets and Credit Suisse were the mandated underwriters on the IPO.

OCSI,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion should be read in connection with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Some of the statements in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q constitute forward-looking statements because they relate to future events or our future performance or financial condition. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q may include statements as to: our future operating results and distribution projections; the ability of Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., or Oaktree or our Investment Adviser, to reposition our portfolio and to implement our Investment Adviser's future plans with respect to our business; our business prospects and the prospects of our portfolio companies; the impact of the investments that we expect to make; the ability of our portfolio companies to achieve their objectives; our expected financings and investments; the adequacy of our cash resources and working capital; the timing of cash flows, if any, from the operations of our portfolio companies; and the cost or potential outcome of any litigation to which we may be a party. In addition, words such as ""anticipate,"" ""believe,"" ""expect,"" ""seek,"" ""plan,"" ""should,"" ""estimate,"" ""project"" and ""intend"" indicate forward-looking statements, although not all forward-looking statements include these words. The forward-looking statements contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed in the forward-looking statements for any reason, including the factors set forth in ""Item 1A. Risk Factors"" in our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2017 and elsewhere in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. changes in the economy, financial markets and political environment; risks associated with possible disruption in our operations or the economy generally due to terrorism or natural disasters; future changes in laws or regulations (including the interpretation of these laws and regulations by regulatory authorities) and conditions in our operating areas, particularly with respect to business development companies or regulated investment companies, or RICs; and other considerations that may be disclosed from time to time in our publicly disseminated documents and filings. We have based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q on information available to us on the date of this quarterly report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Although we undertake no obligation to revise or update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, you are advised to consult any additional disclosures that we may make directly to you or through reports that we in the future may file with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q and current reports on Form 8-K. companies across a variety of industries that typically possess business models we expect to be resilient in the future with underlying fundamentals that will provide strength in future downturns. We intend to deploy capital across credit and economic cycles with a focus on long-term results, which we believe will enable us to build lasting partnerships with financial sponsors and management teams. Under normal market conditions, through January 18, 2018, at least 80% of the value of our net assets plus borrowings for investment purposes will be invested in floating rate senior loans, which include both first and second lien secured debt financings. Effective January 19, 2018, the Company is no longer subject to this policy. We invest in unsecured loans, including subordinated loans, issued by private middle-market companies and, to a lesser extent, senior and subordinated loans issued by public companies and equity investments. Our Investment Adviser intends to reposition our portfolio in the near-term in order to (1) rotate out of a small number of investments that it views as challenged, (2) focus on increasing the size of our core private investments and New Investment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree Upon the closing of the transactions, or the Transaction, contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, by and among Oaktree, our Former Adviser and, for certain limited purposes, Fifth Street Asset Management Inc., or FSAM, the indirect, partial owner of our Former Adviser, and Fifth Street Holdings L.P., the direct, partial owner of our Former Adviser, on October 17, 2017, Oaktree became the investment adviser to each of Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation, or OCSL, and us, and Oaktree paid gross cash consideration of $320 million to our Former Adviser. The closing of the Transaction resulted in an assignment for purposes of the 1940 Act of our investment advisory agreement with FSM, or the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, and, as a result, its immediate termination. The material terms of the services to be provided under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, other than the fee structure, are substantially the same as the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, except that services are provided by Oaktree. See ""Note 11. Related Party Transactions-New Investment Advisory Agreement"" and ""-Administrative Services"" in the notes to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements. Directors must not be interested persons of Oaktree or our Former Adviser. Second, an ""unfair burden"" must not be imposed on us as a result of the closing of the Transaction or any express or implied terms, conditions or understandings applicable thereto during the two-year period after the closing of the Transaction. Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follow: Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the measurement date. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. Level 3 - Unobservable inputs that reflect management's best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model. If inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy, an investment's level is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment. This includes investment securities that are valued using ""bid"" and ""ask"" prices obtained from independent third party pricing services or directly from brokers. These investments may be classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions. If the quotation provided by the pricing service is based on only one or two market sources, we perform additional procedures to corroborate such information, which may include the market yield technique discussed below and a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the credit quality and market trends affecting the portfolio company. Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with management of our Investment Adviser; The Investment Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee; The Audit Committee reviews the preliminary valuations with our Investment Adviser, and our Investment Adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee; The Audit Committee makes a recommendation to our full Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio; and Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio. The fair value of our investments as of December 31, 2017 and September 30, 2017 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has and will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Board of Directors may reasonably rely on that assistance. As of December 31, 2017, 77.7% of our portfolio at fair value was valued either based on market quotations, the transactions precedent approach or by independent valuation firms. The percentage of our portfolio valued by independent valuation firms may vary from period to period based on the availability of market quotations for our portfolio investments during the respective periods. However, our Board of Directors is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process.

We may also invest in unsecured loans, including subordinated loans, issued by private middle-market companies and, to a lesser extent, senior and subordinated loans issued by public companies and equity investments. Following entry into the New Investment Advisory Agreement, our Investment Adviser intends to reposition our portfolio in the near-term in order to (1) rotate out of a small number of investments that it views as challenged, (2) focus on increasing the size of our core private investments and (3) supplement the portfolio with broadly syndicated and select privately placed loans. We expect that our Investment Adviser will focus on middle-market companies, which we define as companies with enterprise values of between $100 and $750 million. Going forward, we expect our portfolio to include primarily first lien floating rate senior secured financings. We generally invest in securities that are rated below investment grade by rating agencies or that would be rated below investment grade if they were rated. Below investment grade securities, which are often referred to as ""high yield"" and ""junk,"" have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal. Business Environment and Developments New Investment Advisory Agreement with Oaktree Upon the closing of the Transaction on October 17, 2017, Oaktree became the investment adviser to each of OCSL and us, and Oaktree paid gross cash consideration of $320 million to our Former Adviser. The closing of the Transaction resulted in an assignment for purposes of the 1940 Act of the Former Investment Advisory Agreement and, as a result, its immediate termination. The material terms of the services to be provided under the New Investment Advisory Agreement, other than the fee structure, are substantially the same as the Former Investment Advisory Agreement, except that services are provided by Oaktree. See ""Business-The Investment Adviser"" and ""-New Investment Advisory Agreement."" Hierarchical levels, defined by ASC 820 and directly related to the amount of subjectivity associated with the inputs to fair valuation of these assets and liabilities, are as follow: Level 1 - Unadjusted, quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date. Level 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data at the measurement date for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

These investments may be classified as Level 3 because the quoted prices may be indicative in nature for securities that are in an inactive market, may be for similar securities or may require adjustments for investment-specific factors or restrictions. We estimate the fair value of privately held warrants using a Black Scholes pricing model, which includes an analysis of various factors and subjective assumptions including, the current stock price (by using an EV analysis as described above), the expected period until exercise, expected volatility of the underlying stock price, expected dividends and the risk-free rate. Changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates. Our Board of Directors undertakes a multi-step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments: Preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with management of our Investment Adviser; The Investment Adviser compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the valuations of the independent valuation firms and prepares a valuation report for the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors; The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors reviews the preliminary valuations with our Investment Adviser, and our Investment Adviser responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any discussions between our Investment Adviser and the Audit Committee; The Audit Committee of our Board of Directors makes a recommendation to our Board of Directors regarding the fair value of the investments in our portfolio; and Our Board of Directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio. The fair value of our investments at September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 was determined in good faith by our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors has authorized the engagement of independent valuation firms to provide valuation assistance. We will continue to engage independent valuation firms to provide assistance regarding the determination of the fair value of a portion of our portfolio securities for which market quotations are not readily available or are readily available but deemed not reflective of the fair value of the investment each quarter, and the Board of Directors may reasonably rely on that assistance. The percentage of our portfolio valued by independent valuation firms may vary from period to period based on the availability of market quotations for our portfolio investments during the respective periods. Typically, a higher percentage of our portfolio is valued by independent valuation firms in our fiscal fourth quarter due to additional year-end procedures. However, our Board of Directors is responsible for the ultimate valuation of the portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and a consistently applied valuation process. The percentages of our portfolio, at fair value, valued by independent valuation firms as of the end of each period during the current and two preceding fiscal years were as follows: As of December 31, 2014 54.1 % As of March 31, 2015 (1) 32.1 % As of June 30, 2015 23.8 % As of September 30, 2015 (2) 76.5 % As of December 31, 2015 29.3 % As of March 31, 2016 25.0 % As of June 30, 2016 32.0 % As of September 30, 2016 (2) 73.5 % As of December 31, 2016 29.6 % As of March 31, 2017 30.1 % As of June 30, 2017 29.4 %  As of September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016, approximately 92.1% and 92.2%, respectively, of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at prices equal to fair value.

OCSI,"LOS ANGELES, CA, Feb 09, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation OCSI, +0.63% (""Oaktree Strategic Income"" or the ""Company""), a specialty finance company, today announced its unaudited financial results for the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2017. First Fiscal Quarter 2018 Highlights Total investment income of $10.7 million, or $0.36 per share;  Net investment income of $4.5 million, or $0.15 per share;  Net asset value per share as of December 31, 2017 of $9.84; and  Originated $136.2 million of new investment commitments and received $71.3 million in connection with full repayments and exits of investments. Recent Developments On January 31, 2018, the Company entered into a new secured revolving credit facility. The facility's total capacity is $100 million and the revolving period expires on January 30, 2021 with a final maturity date of January 31, 2023. Management Commentary ""We are glad to report the credit quality of the Oaktree Strategic Income portfolio is strong as the majority of our investments are performing well,"" said Edgar Lee, Chief Executive Officer and Chief Investment Officer of Oaktree Strategic Income. ""Since we began managing the portfolio in mid-October, we have been focused on redeploying capital from loan payoffs and exits into larger, first lien loans to a diversified group of stable, middle-market companies. Looking to the future, we are excited about the opportunity to deploy capital into higher yielding, proprietary originations generated by Oaktree's platform."" Portfolio and Investment Activity As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $541.4 million and was comprised of investments in 65 portfolio companies and the investments in FSFR Glick JV LLC (""Glick JV""). At fair value, 89.2% of the Company's portfolio as of December 31, 2017 consisted of senior secured floating-rate debt investments, including 86.0% of first lien loans and 3.2% of second lien loans; 10.6% consisted of a subordinated note investment in Glick JV; and 0.2% consisted of equity investments in other portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2017, Glick JV had $151.5 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 25 portfolio companies. The joint venture generated income of $1.5 million for Oaktree Strategic Income during the quarter ended December 31, 2017. The weighted average yield on the Company's debt investments as of December 31, 2017, including the return on our subordinated note investment in Glick JV, was 7.1%. During the quarter ended December 31, 2017, the Company originated $136.2 million of new investment commitments, including investments in 17 new and three existing portfolio companies and funded $143.9 million of investments across new and existing portfolio companies. During the quarter, the Company received $71.3 million in connection with the full repayments and exits of eight of its investments, and an additional $90.1 million in connection with other paydowns and sales of investments. Results of Operations Total investment income for the quarter ended December 31, 2017 was $10.7 million, including $10.0 million of cash interest income from portfolio investments, as compared with total investment income of $11.8 million and cash interest income of $10.9 million for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The decline in total investment income was primarily due to a lower weighted average yield on investments and a smaller average portfolio size during the quarter, as loan payoffs and exits exceeded fundings. Net expenses for the quarter were $6.2 million, a slight decline from $6.3 million in the prior quarter, primarily due to lower management and incentive fees and general and administrative expenses, partially offset by higher professional fees. Net unrealized appreciation on the investment portfolio for the quarter was $1.7 million. Net realized loss for the quarter was $4.4 million, which was primarily driven by the sale of the Company's first lien term loan investment in New Trident Holdcorp, Inc. during the quarter. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of December 31, 2017, the Company had $46.2 million of cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash), total principal value of debt outstanding of $254.1 million, and $95.9 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facilities and 2015 debt securitization, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 3.57% as of December 31, 2017. As of December 31, 2017, the Company's total leverage ratio was 0.88x debt-to-equity. Dividend Declaration The Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.14 per share, payable on March 30, 2018 to stockholders of record on March 15, 2018. Dividends are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company's stockholders. Portfolio Asset Quality As of December 31, 2017, there were three investments on which the Company had stopped accruing cash and/or payment-in-kind (""PIK"") interest or original issue discount (""OID"") income that, in the aggregate, represented 4.1% of the debt portfolio at cost and 1.2% at fair value.

Management Commentary ""We are very excited to be managing Oaktree Strategic Income,"" said Edgar Lee, Chief Executive Officer of Oaktree Strategic Income. ""The vast majority of the portfolio is invested in senior secured loans to established middle-market companies that are performing well. We have begun making new investments and over time, we intend to increase our exposure to larger, more liquid first lien loans in both the broadly syndicated and private placement markets. We believe the Oaktree platform and our ability to co-invest alongside other Oaktree funds positions us well to deliver stable income and attractive returns to our stockholders over time."" Portfolio and Investment Activity As of September 30, 2017, the fair value of the investment portfolio was $560.4 million and total assets were $608.7 million. The investment portfolio consisted of investments in 67 companies and also included the Company's investment in FSFR Glick JV LLC (""Glick JV""). At fair value, 89.5% of the Company's portfolio as of September 30, 2017 consisted of senior secured floating-rate debt investments, including 84.9% of first lien loans and 4.6% of second lien loans; 10.3% consisted of a subordinated note in Glick JV; and 0.2% in equity investments in other portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2017, Glick JV had $126.7 million in assets, including senior secured loans to 23 portfolio companies. The joint venture generated income of $1.2 million for Oaktree Strategic Income during the fourth quarter. The weighted average yield on the Company's debt investments as of September 30, 2017, including the return on our subordinated note investment in Glick JV, was 7.5%, including 7.3% representing cash payments. During the quarter ended September 30, 2017, the Company originated $108.7 million of investment commitments in 10 new and seven existing portfolio companies and funded $108.4 million across new and existing portfolio companies. During the quarter, the Company received $71.3 million in connection with the full repayments and exits of eight of its investments, and an additional $23.2 million in connection with other paydowns and sales of investments. Results of Operations Total investment income for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 was $11.8 million, including $10.9 million of cash interest income from portfolio investments. Net expenses for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 were $6.3 million. Net expenses increased slightly from $6.2 million in the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Net unrealized depreciation on the investment portfolio for the quarter was $20.0 million, which was primarily due to significant write-downs on a number of the Company's portfolio companies, including $10.3 million on one of the Company's investments. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2017, the Company had $43.0 million of cash and cash equivalents, total principal value of debt outstanding of $263.0 million, and $67.0 million of undrawn capacity on its credit facilities, subject to borrowing base and other limitations. The weighted average interest rate on debt outstanding was 3.26% as of September 30, 2017. As of September 30, 2017, the Company's total leverage ratio was 0.90x debt-to-equity. Dividend Declaration On August 7, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter dividend of $0.19 per share, payable on December 29, 2017 to stockholders of record on December 15, 2017. Dividends are paid primarily from distributable (taxable) income. To the extent taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of distributions for that fiscal year, a portion of those distributions may be deemed a return of capital to the Company's stockholders. Portfolio Asset Quality As of September 30, 2017, there were three investments on which the Company had stopped accruing cash and/or PIK interest or original issue discount (""OID"") income that, in the aggregate, represented 5.6% of the debt portfolio at cost and 1.1% at fair value.

OCSI,"GREENWICH, CT, Aug 21, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. FSAM, -2.29% (""FSAM"" or ""we"") today announced its financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2017. Second Quarter 2017 Highlights GAAP net loss attributable to FSAM for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 of $0.9 million, or $0.06 per share;  Total revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 of $15.9 million; and  Management fees represented 88.8% of total revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2017. Results of Operations Total revenues for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $15.9 million, representing a $7.3 million, or 31.4%, decrease from $23.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. Management fees (which include base management fees and Part I fees) for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $14.1 million, representing 88.8% of total revenues. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower levels of fee-earning assets and pre-incentive fee net investment income at FSC. Total expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $19.4 million, and include amounts reimbursed by our funds of $1.8 million and IPO-related compensation charges of $1.0 million. After adjusting for these items, net expenses were $16.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2017, which included non-recurring professional and consulting fees of $8.9 million and severance and other one-time compensation costs of $1.3 million. Total expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 were $22.1 million, and include amounts reimbursed by our funds of $1.8 million, IPO-related compensation charges of $1.9 million, lease termination/abandonment charges of $2.9 million and operating expenses attributable to MMKT of $0.4 million. After adjusting for these items, net expenses were $15.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016, which included non-recurring professional and consulting fees of $5.9 million and severance and other one-time compensation costs of $0.7 million. Net expenses for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 were $16.7 million, representing an increase of $1.6 million from $15.1 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. This increase was primarily due to higher levels of non-recurring professional and consulting fees and one-time compensation costs in the current period. Excluding these non-recurring professional and compensation costs, net expenses decreased by $2.0 million as compared to the quarter ended June 30, 2016, primarily driven by lower employee headcount in the current period. GAAP net loss attributable to FSAM for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 was $0.9 million or $0.06 per share, versus GAAP net income attributable to FSAM of $0.8 million, or $0.15 per share, for the quarter ended June 30, 2016. The decrease in GAAP net income (loss) attributable to FSAM was primarily due to the revenue and net expense variances described above.

As amended and restated, the credit facility is a $100 million term loan facility that matures on August 1, 2019 and provides for monthly amortization of amounts owing under the facility beginning on January 1, 2018 at a rate of 5.0% of the aggregate amount outstanding as of January 1, 2018, subject to certain reductions. The credit facility is now secured by substantially all of the assets of FSH and certain of its subsidiaries. NewStar Financial Purchase Agreement On July 1, 2017, FSH entered into a purchase agreement with New Star Financial, Inc (""Newstar""). At the closing of the transactions contemplated thereby on July 20, 2017, NewStar acquired 100% of the limited liability company interests of Fifth Street CLO Management LLC (""CLO Management""), a wholly-owned subsidiary of FSH and the collateral manager for the two Fifth Street-managed CLOs. The aggregate purchase price was $29.0 million less borrowings outstanding at CLO Management, subject to post-closing adjustments for working capital and transactions expenses, which resulted in an aggregate net purchase price of $15.3 million. Oaktree Asset Purchase Agreement On July 13, 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (""Oaktree""), under which Oaktree would become the new investment adviser to Fifth Street's two business development companies (""BDCs""), Fifth Street Finance Corp.

On completion of the transaction, Oaktree will take over as the investment advisor of both the BDCs from FSM and an affiliate of Oaktree will become their administrator. Post the acquisition, FSC will take on the name of Oaktree Specialty Lending Corporation, and will trade under the ticker ""OCSL"", whereas, FSFR will take on the name of Oaktree Strategic Income Corporation, and will trade under the ticker""OCSI"".

Tannenbaum, CEO of FSAM said: ""Over the course of FSAM's strategic review, it became clear to us that given the market environment and headwinds we faced over the past year and a half, it would be difficult to scale our CLO business. We believe that exiting this business line is in the best interest of our shareholders and is an important step as we continue to enhance our liquidity position and streamline operations."" Tim Conway, Chairman and CEO of NewStar added: ""This acquisition is consistent with our strategy to expand our asset management activities in ways that add to our value proposition for institutional investors and leverage our core strengths in direct lending, securitization and credit management. This transaction also provides an attractive way to diversify our business mix, adding to fee revenue and accelerating improvement in equity returns."" Details of the transaction The transaction is valued at approximately $16 million including $13 million in debt. The offer price is subject to adjustments at the time of closing of the transaction. The transaction is expected to close in Q3 2017 and is subject to consents from certain investors and other closing conditions. Once the transaction is closed, FSCM will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of NewStar and all funds managed by FSCM will be managed by NewStar's middle market investment team. FSAM plans to use the funds raised from the sale of its middle market CLO business to reduce its debts and take care of other corporate expenses. Benefits of the acquisition for NewStar The acquisition will increase NewStar's assets under management (AUM) by approximately $726 million. After the transaction is completed, NewStar's total pro-forma AUM will increase to approximately $7.3 billion. The transaction is expected to be accretive to NewStar's EPS (earnings per share) for FY 2017. The transaction is expected to add to NewStar's run-rate fee revenue by more than $2.5 million and is also expected to help in the growth of the Company's asset management activities. In the last few months, NewStar has been focused on expanding its asset management platform. For this, the Company has launched new managed funds, acquired investment management platforms, and increasing its investment activity. The current acquisition is part of NewStar's strategy in this direction. The acquisition is also highly complementary to NewStar's existing middle market direct lending business and provides balance to its overall asset management platform. The acquisition significantly increases NewStar's lending capacity and helps it meet the needs of its private equity clients and make the most of the opportunities in direct lending.

OCSI,"GREENWICH, CT, May 15, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Fifth Street Asset Management Inc. FSAM, -2.29% (""FSAM"" or ""we"") today announced its financial results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017. First Quarter 2017 Highlights GAAP net income attributable to FSAM for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $1.6 million, or $0.10 per share; Adjusted Net Income after tax for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $5.2 million, or $0.10 per share; Fee-earning Assets Under Management (""AUM"") of $3.5 billion as of March 31, 2017; Total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 of $15.6 million; and Management fees represented 86.6% of total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2017. ""As we described last quarter, we took actions at both of our business development companies, FSC and FSFR, to stabilize net asset values and drive long-term value for shareholders of FSAM, as well as FSC and FSFR.  We are pleased that during the March quarter, at both FSC and FSFR, we began to stabilize net asset values, we reduced the amount of investments on non-accrual and we operated within our targeted leverage ranges.  We look forward to providing further updates on how we are improving the fundamentals of our business to drive stockholder value,"" stated Leonard M. Tannenbaum, Chief Executive Officer of FSAM. Results of Operations Total revenues for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $15.6 million, representing a $3.4 million, or 17.9%, decrease from $19.0 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  Management fees (which include base management fees and Part I fees) for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $13.5 million, representing 86.6% of total revenues. The decrease in revenues was primarily due to lower levels of fee-earning assets and pre-incentive fee net investment income at FSC. Total expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $12.0 million, and include amounts reimbursed by our funds of $2.1 million and IPO-related compensation charges of $0.5 million.  After adjusting for these items, net expenses were $9.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which included litigation and other non-recurring legal costs of $1.8 million and severance and other one-time compensation costs of $0.8 million.  Total expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2016 were $16.5 million, and include amounts reimbursed by our funds of $1.9 million, IPO-related compensation charges of $1.6 million, and operating expenses attributable to MMKT of $0.6 million.  After adjusting for these items, net expenses were $12.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016, which included litigation-related costs of $3.2 million. Net expenses for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 were $9.4 million, representing a decrease of $3.0 million from $12.4 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  This decrease was primarily due to reduced headcount and a lower level of litigation-related costs in the current period.  Excluding the non-recurring litigation and compensation costs, net expenses decreased by $2.3 million as compared to the quarter ended March 31, 2016, primarily driven by lower employee-related expenses in the current period. GAAP net income (loss) attributable to FSAM for the quarters ended March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2016 was $1.6 million or $0.10 per share, and $(1.2) million, or $(0.21) per share, respectively.  Adjusted Net Income after tax was $5.2 million, or $0.10 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2017, which represented a $0.9 million, or 15.0%, decrease as compared to Adjusted Net Income after tax of $6.1 million, or $0.12 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, 2016.  The decrease in Adjusted Net Income after tax was primarily due to the revenue and net expense variances described above.

Adjusted Net Income is a non-GAAP measure that represents income before income tax benefit (provision) as adjusted for (i) certain compensation-related charges, (ii) unrealized gains (losses) on beneficial interests in CLOs, MMKT Notes and derivative liabilities, (iii) certain litigation costs and related insurance recoveries, (iv) the difference between cash dividends received from our investments in FSC and FSFR and the related income recognized under the equity method of accounting and (v) other non-recurring items.  Please refer to Exhibit A for a reconciliation of net income (loss) and income (loss) before provision for income taxes to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income after tax.  (2)  AUM refers to assets under management of our funds and material control investments of these funds and represents the sum of the net asset value of such funds and investments, the drawn debt and unfunded debt and equity commitments at the fund or investment level (including amounts subject to restrictions) and uncalled committed debt and equity capital (including commitments to funds that have yet to commence their investment periods). (3)  Fee-earning AUM refers to the AUM on which we directly or indirectly earn management fees and represents the sum of the net asset value of our funds and their material control investments and the drawn debt and unfunded debt and equity commitments at the fund or investment level (including amounts subject to restrictions). Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Operating Metrics Certain of the terms used in this press release, including AUM, fee-earning AUM, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income after tax, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. In addition, our definitions of AUM and fee-earning AUM are not based on any definition of AUM or fee-earning AUM that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage and may differ from definitions of AUM set forth in other agreements to which we are a party from time to time. Further, Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income after tax are not performance measures calculated in accordance with GAAP.  Adjusted Net Income has been included in this press release to adjust for certain one-time, non-recurring or non-operating items. Adjusted Net Income after tax has been included in this press release to reflect certain tax adjustments in connection with our IPO and exclude the financial results of MMKT.  We use Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income after tax as measures of our operating performance, not as measures of liquidity. We believe that Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income after tax provide investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance and Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income after tax are evaluated regularly by our management as decision tools for deployment of resources. We believe that reporting Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income after tax is helpful in understanding our business and that investors should review the same supplemental non-GAAP financial measures that our management uses to analyze our performance. Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income after tax have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyzing our results prepared in accordance with GAAP. The use of Adjusted Net Income or Adjusted Net Income after tax without consideration of related GAAP measures is not adequate due to the adjustments described herein. Income (loss) before provision for income taxes is the GAAP financial measure most comparable to Adjusted Net Income and net income (loss) is the GAAP financial measure most comparable to Adjusted Net Income after tax. Please refer to Exhibit A for a reconciliation of net income and income before income tax benefit (provision) to Adjusted Net Income and Adjusted Net Income after tax.
