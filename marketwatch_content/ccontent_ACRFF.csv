ACRFF,"SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- The $3.3 billion sale of the Fairmont luxury hotel-resort chain to an investment company and a Saudi Arabian prince could be announced as soon as Monday, according to a media report. Colony Capital LLC and Prince Alwaleed bin Talal are near a deal to buy Fairmont Hotels & Resorts Inc. FHR, +5.53% which has 33,000 rooms in 88 properties around the world, The Wall Street Journal reported in its online edition, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. See Wall Street Journal story (subscription required). The deal is for $45 a share, a slight premium to the stock's Friday closing at $43.82, The Journal said. . In the past three months, Fairmont shares have climbed nearly 50% in the past three months as investors anticipated a sale, The Journal said.

Fairmont's board previously rejected Icahn's offer of $40 a share to take control of the company. And such a deal would extend Colony's collection of luxury resort and real-estate assets, which include the Raffles hotel group and the Resorts International gambling concern, The Journal said. Prince Alwaleed, one of the world's richest individuals, has once had or currently maintains stakes in London's Savoy Hotel, New York's Plaza Hotel and Geneva's Hotel des Bergues, The Journal said. Colony and Prince Alwaleed are getting some of the most desirable properties in the business, including two massive properties in Bermuda, resorts across Canadian ski destinations and a Maui hotel and golf club.
