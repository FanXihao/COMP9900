AAXN,"After every mass shooting, there are inevitable headlines saying gun manufacturer stocks have rallied. Then, very often during earnings season, there is a nasty surprise for shareholders, as a company disappoints with sales, earnings or its outlook. So what is going on with industry? It might seem logical after a mass shooting to expect politicians on the federal or state level to begin negotiations on legislation to curb firearms sales in some way. Or one may also expect this if a gun-control advocate is elected. Either circumstance would be expected to lead to a short-term spike in sales of weapons and ammunition, which might make shareholders of the right companies a lot of money. But introducing a bill, negotiating it, passing it and having it signed by a president or governor is no easy task. Buying a stock on the expectation that legislation will lead the federal government or state governments to curb weapons sales is a very risky business. The pop of a gun-maker’s stock following a mass killing or election can be very short lived. FactSet, MarketWatch Also read: Gun-maker stocks rally after mass shooting in Las Vegas. On Thursday, shares of Vista Outdoor Inc. VSTO, +1.37%  were down as much as 33%, after the company missed analysts’ consensus sales estimate for its fiscal second quarter and lowered its full-year outlook. The stock has now plunged 41% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.38%  has gained 3.8%. This makes for a particularly ugly 12-month chart: FactSet It has been a year of suffering for shareholders of Vista Outdoor Inc. What’s going on here? We decided to take a broad look at publicly traded U.S. manufacturers of small firearms and related companies that make different types of weapons that consumers can buy, or that make accessories for firearms that are available to consumers. We prepared the list with help from FactSet and excluded major aerospace/defense government contractors and excluded stocks priced below a dollar and companies for which at least a year’s worth of financial data wasn’t available from FactSet. So the list is relatively short. Here are the companies, sorted by market capitalization as of the market close on Nov. 8: Company Ticker Main business Market capitalization ($mil) Total return - 2017 through Nov. 8 Total return - 3 years Total return - 5 years Olin Corp. OLN, +1.91% Chemical products, ammunition through Winchester segment $6,113 46% 61% 107% Axon Enterprise Inc. AAXN, +3.67% Conducted electrical weapons $1,132 -12% 16% 165% Vista Outdoor Inc.

Some of the longer-term returns are quite impressive, but you can see from this year’s returns, not to mention Thursday’s brutal action for Vista Outdoor, how volatile these stocks can be. Here’s the same group again, in the same order, showing changes in sales gross profit margins, for their most recently reported quarters: Company Ticker Sales - most recent reported quarter ($mil) Sales - year earlier ($mil) Change in sales Gross margin - most recent quarter Gross margin - year earlier Olin Corp. OLN, +1.91% $1,555 $1,453 7% 13.58% 11.59% Axon Enterprise Inc. AAXN, +3.67% $90 $72 26% 55.13% 64.80% Vista Outdoor Inc. VSTO, +1.37% $587 $684 -14% 23.66% 27.09% Sturm, Ruger & Co. RGR, +4.58% $105 $161 -35% 28.83% 31.13% National Presto Industries Inc. NPK, -1.42% $71 $93 -24% N/A 19.84% American Outdoor Brands Corp. AOBC, +4.35% $129 $207 -38% 31.49% 42.31% VirTra Inc.

It is a measure of the profitability of a company’s core business. It excludes overhead. For Vista Outdoor, you can see that not only were sales down significantly, the gross margin was declined. This could indicate a high level of discounting, which wasn’t enough to keep sales from dropping. So even though mass shootings continue to feed controversy over whether or not the U.S. needs a greater level of gun control, it is clear that for most of these companies, the recent sales trend hasn’t been very good. Maybe a lack of demand is the problem, believe it or not as Paul Brandus discussed last year. Yes, some investors have made a lot of money holding certain gun-maker stocks over the long term. But if you wish to jump in now, you had better do plenty of research and be ready to ride out volatility.

AAXN,"With U.S. military strikes top and center in the news, readers have been introduced to some of the most advanced and powerful weaponry built by aerospace and defense companies. Because of the complexity of government procurement processes, the use of certain missiles doesn’t necessarily mean the makers of those weapons will benefit from near-term increases in sales. But it’s helpful for investors to know which contractors have been most successful recently, and which are most favored by analysts. Tomahawk cruise missiles, manufactured by Raytheon Co. RTN, +2.26% were used against a Syrian airfield on April 6. The Massive Ordinance Air Blast (MOAB), or “mother of all bombs,” is made by Boeing Co. BA, +2.46%  and was used against Islamic State terrorists in Afghanistan last week. Raytheon is the fourth-largest U.S. defense contractor, with a market capitalization of $44.5 billion, while Boeing is the biggest player, with a market cap of $106.8 billion. There are 28 aerospace and defense companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index, which comprises the large-cap S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% the S&P 400 Mid-Cap Index MID, +1.35% and the S&P 500 Small-Cap 600 Index SML, +0.99% The industry’s stocks as a group are up 7% this year, with dividends reinvested, while the S&P 1500 is up 4%. Since Donald Trump was elected president Nov. 8, the aerospace and defense industry group has risen 15%, compared with 10% for the index. Trump has said he wishes to increase defense spending by 10%, or by $54 billion. It remains to be seen if the president will get his way, but the stock market tends to be forward-looking, and the recent action shows investors believe favorable times are ahead for defense contractors. Here are several sets of data showing which companies have excelled and which are favored most by Wall Street analysts. The Big Five There are five U.S. aerospace and defense companies with market caps over $40 billion — the Big Five. Here they are, in size order, along a comparison of total returns for their stocks, compared to the index: Company Ticker Total return - 2017 through April 13 Total return 2016 Total return - 3 years Total return - 5 years Boeing Co.

AAXN,"The first generation of police body cameras was introduced in 2005 in Great Britain. Their primary task was, and still is, to record police interactions with the public as well as to gather evidence at crime scenes. During a typical day, every police officer captures hours and hours of footage. To separate the irrelevant data from incriminating evidence, every recording needs to be reviewed and edited. Now imagine sifting through hundreds of hours of police footage, looking for a specific piece of information, such as a verbal exchange between an officer and a suspect, a clear shot of license plates, or a suspect entering a particular building or meeting a particular person. It’s a rather time-consuming task, so a lot of this footage ends up archived to be reviewed later, forfeiting potentially valuable or time-sensitive evidence. The solution could be the use of artificial intelligence. Machine-learning algorithms within an AI system can be trained to differentiate between people and objects, recognize various events, such as car chases and shootings, and even identify people caught on tape through its facial-recognition abilities. It also can do some of the officers’ paperwork. Once AI recognizes patterns, it tags them appropriately, enabling police officers to browse for a particular scene within a video using keywords, just like via online search engines. It also can do some of paperwork that consumes a good chunk of police officers’ time. AI can transcribe verbal interactions as well as handle images and then enter both in reports. With AI working hard as officer’s “personal secretary,” he or she will have more time to concentrate on more important matters. Axon Enterprise Inc. AAXN, +3.67% formerly Taser International and best known for its Taser electroshock weapon, has since diversified into technology products for police officers. Its Axon AI division is now working to create a system that will use enhanced image/video/audio processing and integrate AI and deep-learning capabilities. As you can see, there are many reasons why using AI and body cameras in police work is a good idea. However, there’s another side to this story. AI’s facial-recognition ability raises privacy concerns, because it allows the police to track down any individual captured on the footage simply by running the video through the algorithm. Here's how drones will change the future of warfare This footage be abused by police departments as well as other officials. In addition, hackers, criminals and others could get their hands on it since the data are stored in the cloud. Although faces can be redacted from the videos as it’s being uploaded, it’s only a matter of time before systems evolve enough to enable dynamic facial recognition, making these videos even more powerful tools in the hands of individuals or organizations that seek to establish mass surveillance — a dream come true for any authoritarian regime. Finally, some may ask what guarantee there is to prevent for-profit companies from acquiring and reselling police footage on the black market or on the dark web. Criminals can use that information to learn how police operate, for example. Still I believe these cameras should exist since their benefits outweigh their disadvantages. Could the same be said in five, 10 or 15 years? Only time will tell. In the meantime, you could start wearing these while running errands to trick facial-recognition systems.

AAXN,"Donald Trump wants to bring the word “Christmas” back into the public lexicon, rescuing it from years of banishment by the PC crowd. He might as well just go all the way and dress up as Santa, too, as far as investors are concerned, because he will enter office bearing lots of potentially sweet presents for them. By far the biggest: a huge tax cut for companies. Trump wants to reduce their tax rate to 15% from 35%. He might not get that. Any reduction may more likely put the new rate at around 20%. That’s because that is closer to the level often cited by Congressional Republican leaders, says Larry Puglia, who manages $55 billion in assets including the T. Rowe Price Blue Chip Growth Fund TRBCX, +1.79% Puglia was busy recently hunting for companies that pay high tax rates because they stand to benefit the most from a Trump tax cut, and for good reason. Even a reduction to 20% would bring enormous benefits to investors. To gauge how much, consider this simple rule of thumb, says Bastiat Capital founder Albert Meyer, an accounting expert whose stock selections for investors are up 123% since April 2006, compared with 68% for the benchmark S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38% Theoretically, at least, the market capitalization, or value, of a company should increase by the dollar amount of tax saved multiplied by the company’s price-to-earnings ratio. This is another way of saying that as earnings increase by the amount of tax saved, either the P/E has to go down or the stock price has to go up. This won’t always be the case, of course, but it is a good rule of thumb. As an example, Meyer cites Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW, +2.59% because it pays no foreign taxes. Schwab paid $734 million in federal taxes in 2015, for an effective tax rate of 32.2%. If that fell to 20%, the company might have paid $456 million in taxes, saving $278 million. Multiply Schwab’s P/E of 25.5 by that $278 million in extra earnings and you get a $7.1 billion increase in market cap. That boosts Schwab’s capitalization to $59.1 billion from $52 billion, for a 13.6% increase in the value of the company, and presumably its stock. Here’s another way to think about it, from Puglia at T. Rowe Price. If a company has a 40% tax rate, that means it has a 60% after-tax profit margin. If you lower the tax rate to 20%, that’s a 33% boost in earnings. (The decline of 20 percentage points divided by 60% is 33%.) “The change would be very favorable to companies that have a high tax rate,” he says. “I don’t think people are focusing on this as much as they should.” Bigger division of wealth? Of course, it’s tempting to write off the Trump tax cut as yet more benefits for corporate bigwigs while the little guy gets ignored. But that’s not necessarily the case. Presumably, companies would invest much of the windfall, creating new jobs, and inventing new products and drugs. “We are robbing ourselves when we tax these engines of wealth, jobs, innovation and progress,” says Meyer. “If [former Fed Chairman] Ben Bernanke thought it was a good idea to apply quantitative easing to engineer a wealth effect, a cut in corporate taxes is far more effective and tangible.” Plus, if the tax cut boosts the stock market, that will reduce unfunded pension liabilities at governments across the country, potentially lowering the tax burden on individuals, says Neil Hennessy, chairman and chief investment officer of the Hennessy Funds. “If you truly want to take care of middle America, you want a lower corporate tax,” he says. The fine print There are a few qualifiers to this theory, though. One is that fiscally conservative Republicans may well push hard for any cut in the corporate tax rate to be revenue neutral, because of worries about our nation’s $19 trillion in debt, which goes above $60 trillion if you include promises from Medicare and other entitlements. This suggests the elimination of corporate tax deductions to offset the lower tax rate. “We don’t know what the tax structure will ultimately look like, but many deductions might be phased out,” says Puglia. So, theoretically, as many companies could be hurt as helped by Trump’s tax changes. That could make the whole thing a wash, in terms of how much it helps the economy. The other problem is that while the S&P 500 could get a boost from the tax cut, it would theoretically be about 10.5%. That’s certainly nice. But it won’t solve the financial woes of Chicago or other profligate governments. For the math geeks, here’s the logic behind my estimated 10.5% boost to the market, from a corporate tax cut to 20%. Among S&P 500 companies, 441 of them broke out U.S. taxes paid in their most recent annual reports, according to screens run for me by S&P Global Market Intelligence. I cut out the rest of them for my calculation here, since we don’t know what they paid in domestic taxes. My “S&P 441” paid $218.6 billion in U.S. taxes in 2015. I knock that down by 7% to account for state and local taxes, for an estimated federal tax paid of $203.3 billion. This number includes current year tax paid plus deferred tax. A cut in the tax rate to 20% implies a tax savings of about $87.1 billion. That’s because 20% divided by 35% times $203.3 billion suggests a new tax bill of $116.2 billion, for the roughly $87.1 billion in savings. (That’s $203.3 billion minus $116.2 billion.) Multiply that $87.1 billion by the forward P/E of 22 for my “S&P 441” (that P/E comes from S&P Global Market Intelligence) and we get $1.9 trillion. Added to a $18.3 trillion market cap for the 441 stocks that are my subgroup of the S&P 500, and that’s a gain of about 10.5%.

AAXN,"The iPhone 7 is a hot new item, but followers of Apple expect the company’s next “supercycle” to take just a year, with the iPhone 8 coming out next fall with some radical new features. Sandy Villere, co-manager of the Villere Balanced Fund VILLX, +1.31%  believes investors are looking at an excellent opportunity to scoop up shares of Skyworks Solutions Inc. SWKS, +1.41% because the stock has nose-dived, as revenue at Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78% has declined.  Skyworks derives about 40% of its revenue from Foxconn Technology, which purchases components from Skyworks for use when assembling iPhones for Apple, according to comments made by Skyworks CFO Kris Sennesael during a conference call with analysts on Nov. 3. Here’s a two-year chart for the stock, through Nov. 10, showing just how volatile it has been, and its huge decline since July 2015: Skyworks Solutions stock has been volatile. Apple’s sales for its fourth fiscal quarter ended Sept. 24 were down 9% from a year earlier, while Skyworks reported a 5.2% decline in its third-quarter sales. The recent trend obviously hasn’t been good for either company, and it remains to be seen how much of a sales bump Apple will get from the iPhone 7, which was rolled out in September. But Villere still pins his hopes for Skyworks on Apple. “The revenue Skyworks is getting on each phone is increasing. As time goes on, your iPhone is going to do more and more and more,” he said in an interview. He also said he expected a massive bump for iPhone sales after the iPhone 8 supercycle begins, hopefully in 2017. Don’t miss: It may be time to take some Trump stock profits Skyworks also supplies manufacturers who make Android smartphones. “It is a play on phones in general becoming better all the time,” Villere said. Villere & Co. Sandy Villere, co-manager of the Villere Balanced Fund The Villere Balanced Fund is “unique,” according to Villere, because it typically holds only about 30 stocks, with at least 25% of the fund invested in bonds, to provide growth and income, with some downside protection. According to Morningstar, funds in the same category, with stock allocation of 50-70% equity, hold 391 securities on average. Villere said he and his colleagues select stocks of “dominant companies that trade at reasonable prices, “usually with a theme.” He likes some bank stocks, because of the expected end of the low-interest-rate cycle. He also thinks “technology stocks will be leaders.” Two more stock picks Villere likes First Hawaiian Inc FHB, +0.29% the holding company for First Hawaiian Bank, which was partially spun off by BNP Paribas SA BNPQY, +0.58%  in July. First Hawaiian’s stock trades for 18.4 times the consensus 2017 earnings estimate, among analysts polled by FactSet, and for 1.6 times book value. While those valuations don’t look particularly low, Villiere said the stock is “trading at a discount... since BNP still owns 83% of the bank. Everyone is assuming BNP will continue to sell. So nobody wants to step in now.” In January, after a required six-month waiting period following the initial offering, there can be plenty of pressure on the shares if BNP begins selling heavily. Villere expects major investors will “want to wait until they can get a bigger piece, or wait until selling pressure is out of the way.” Another stock Villere mentioned as being attractive but “off the beaten path,” is Financial Engines Inc. FNGN, +1.74% which is a large registered investment adviser that helps large 401(k) providers select mutual funds. The company’s larger customers include Ford Motor Co. F, +2.03% Comcast Corp.

AAXN,"SAN DIEGO — The day when police zap suspects from the sky with drones carrying stun guns may be nearing. Taser International Inc., known for its stun guns and body cameras, is exploring the concept of a drone armed with a stun gun for use by police. This week, the company held discussions with police officials about such a device during a law-enforcement conference here. “Following recent events, including the use of a robot to deploy lethal force in Dallas to eliminate a highly dangerous threat, we’ve received questions about whether it would be feasible to similarly deploy a TASER from an autonomous vehicle,” Taser US:TASR   spokesman Steve Tuttle said, referring to the Dallas police department’s use of a bomb-disposal robot armed with C-4 explosive to take out a gunman who had targeted and killed five officers in July. The concept is likely to generate backlash from those opposed to the militarization of police as tensions are already high among authorities and minority communities over police killings of black men. “The public is going to initially be alarmed by this,” Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation, a research group, who viewed the drone at the conference and talked with a Taser employee about it.

AAXN,"Taser International Inc. on Thursday said sales jumped 26% in the latest quarter as bookings for body cameras more than doubled, though profit fell during the period because of higher expenses. Shares rose 1.9% to $29.50 in after-hours trading, as the lower earnings were still stronger than expected. More police agencies have moved to equip officers with body cameras as demand for police accountability and transparency grows. Taser, known for its stun guns, has expanded its Axon brand to combine its body cameras with the technology from its video system. The company has said its Axon body camera segment is accelerating faster than the company had anticipated, and it expects increased bookings to continue. For the three months ended June 30, revenue in the Axon segment increased 49% to $13.2 million. The result was propelled by a $1.93 million increase in service revenue. Revenue in Taser's weapons segment increased 20% to $45.5 million. In the latest quarter, however, total operating expenses climbed 46% to $31.1 million. Over all, Taser's profit fell from a year ago to $3.7 million from $6.1 million. Its per-share earnings sagged to 7 cents from 11 cents a year ago. Sales rose to $58.8 million from $46.7 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected 4 cents in per-share profit on $54 million in revenue.

AAXN,"The big question is whether this market’s five-week rush higher will rev up even more — or now totally fall apart. Look closely at one market leader for an answer, says Chris Kimble over at Kimble Charting Solutions. He advises watching the biotech sector, “which has been in the leadership role since the 2011 lows.” Plenty of market watchers are tracking the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF IBB, +0.72% in particular. Some are sounding bearish after the sector’s recent runup, which accelerated yesterday as IBB component Dyax US:DYAX  popped 28% on Shire SHPG, +3.36% SHP, +2.01%  gobbling it up. One negative take: And speaking of market-leading and growthy ETFs, other traders are fired up about the latest action by the QQQ QQQ, +1.83%  — the big tech-heavy ETF that tracks the Nasdaq 100 NDX, +1.86%  . Though some find recent trading volume unconvincing: Read on for more on biotech from Kimble, who provides the call of the day. Meanwhile, today’s chart pokes fun at all those bears who have been dead wrong — at least over the past five weeks. The call Biotech has been a “downside leader” during the market’s summer slump, after helping take the market higher for years, writes Kimble in his latest blog post. Therefore, he suggests that as it goes for the iShares biotech ETF, so it goes for the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  . “What IBB does at resistance, could tell us a ton [about] where the broad markets are at year end,” he writes. The resistance area for IBB is shown in the chart below from Kimble. The biotech ETF was certainly trying to fight through that troublesome spot on Monday, as it jumped 3.9%.

AAXN,"When a large company has a major problem, it’s natural for investors to think about when they might be able to scoop up the stock cheaply and make a killing on an eventual rebound. But it’s too early to consider bottom-fishing for Volkswagen AG VOW, +3.50% even though the company’s stock declined 29% over two days this week. The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday that Volkswagen admitted creating software to lower diesel cars’ emissions during inspections. Based on the 482,000 affected diesel cars that were sold in the U.S., VW VLKAY, +3.65% could face fines as high as $18 billion. Read: Volkswagen lied to me when I bought my Jetta diesel Cheating on emissions rules has actually affected 11 million cars around the world. There’s no way to know how many countries’ regulators will become involved in the scandal and how much money will ultimately be on the line, not only from fines, but from lawsuits. Read: VW CEO resigns over EPA emissions-test scandal “We look at single events that are assessable and containable,” said Villere & Co. partner George Young, when discussing the type of so-called special situations he and his colleagues look at when picking stocks. Villere & Co. is headquartered in New Orleans and has about $3 billion in assets under management. In an interview Wednesday, Young mentioned two special situations that led to profitable investments for his firm. One was Carnival Corp. CCL, +1.45% which took a beating after the Costa Concordia ran aground off Italy’s west coast in January 2012. “We could quickly assess the liability, apart from the environmental liability,” from the cruise-ship disaster, Young said. Young contrasted his risk assessment for Carnival with the explosion of the BP PLC BP, +2.37%   Deepwater Horizon well in the Gulf of Mexico in April 2010. It took three months to cap the well, which meant there was no way to know how much oil would be spilled, not to mention the ultimate total of risk to BP from fines and civil suits. Villere & Co. prefers to stick with U.S. companies “because we have a level paying field with GAAP [financial accounting] and more liquidity and opportunities for diversification,” Young said. He also said that while he and his colleagues prefer to invest in small and mid-sized companies, Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.78%  was an attractive stock when it showed weakness in the summer of 2011. Apple co-founder and former CEO Steve Jobs died on Oct. 5, 2011. Read: The numbers don’t lie: Apple’s stock is a bargain “Apple and Carnival were unfortunate,” Young said, but they were “objective rather than subjective,” like Volkswagen is now, because of the fraud. A special opportunity Young favors Taser International Inc. US:TASR because of law enforcement’s need for nonlethal weapons, especially in light of the events in Furguson, Mo., and other shootings of unarmed civilians. Taser also makes body cameras, which can lower police officers’ risk while protecting civilians, and the company stores and manages the data as well. Taser isn’t the lowest-price competitor in its industry. But Young said: “We’ve heard from several law enforcement sources that it’s the best out there.” The stock isn’t cheap, closing at $23.37 on Tuesday and trading for 44.9 times the consensus 2016 earnings estimate among analysts. That’s twice the valuation of the Nasdaq Composite. But when seeking investment opportunities based on special circumstances, it’s best to look for growth, and not only recovery plays. There’s no question that there’s a pressing need for the products and services that Taser offers.

AAXN,"The market has finally come to a head. We are now at the point where the market will ultimately have to make a decision, and the next move in the upcoming week will be the determining factor. As I have been saying for weeks now, I do not have a strong edge as to which direction the market is going to take for its next bigger move, and I am looking for a strong clue. Early next week will likely provide that clue, and should provide us with a directional bias for at least the next few weeks, if not few months. As I have also been noting for weeks, those that want to make directional ""bets"" on the market should be utilizing individual stocks, as they will likely outperform the market. This past week reinforced just how correct that expectation has been. To this end, our StockWaves analysts once again performed exceptionally. On the long side of the market, their SunPower SPWR, +4.18% Booz Allen Hamilton BAH, +1.71%  and Western Digital earnings analysis outperformed the overall market. Moreover, their Qorvo and Taser International US:TASR analysis provided some very impressive short side opportunities this past week. For this week, I am going to lay out the patterns I am watching in the S&P500, and will allow the market to clue us in early next week as to which one is the most likely in play. First, we have moved up into our next turn date, as you can see on our 60-minute chart linked at the end of this column. Ideally, this would present a market high to me, as long as we remain below the high made on Friday. A decline from this region would either be a wave ii in the green count, which sets up a rally to the 2150-2175SPX region, or a big wave iii down in red taking us to the 2000 region by the middle of August. The manner in which the decline takes shape will provide us with the difference between the two patterns. Should that decline develop impulsively, then I will be looking for the wave iii toward the 2000 region, with the entire decline ending at the end of August in the 1980SPX region. We need to break 2064SPX to begin that confirmation process. However, a corrective decline would have me looking for a long-side trade toward the higher target region between 2150-2175. But please note that an immediate breakout over Friday's high, with strong follow through over 2125SPX early next week would make me view us has heading directly toward 2175 without much of a pullback. Should the market set us up in bullish count to 2150-2175, then that will likely complete this larger-degree 3rd wave off the 2009 lows, and will likely be immediately followed by the larger-degree 4th wave taking us back to the 1800 region. Alternatively, it would take a break out over the 2220 region to make me rethink this potential, as such a break out would be telling us we are heading to 2500. But again, while that was my ideal expectation coming into 2015, the market has developed in such a way as to make me view that as a lower-probability potential at this time, and it would need to break out over 2220 to make a move to 2500 a much higher probability. Should the market drop next week in impulsive fashion to confirm the bearish case, then we will likely be dropping quite strongly back down toward the 2043SPX region in red wave 3 of iii, and as long as we remain below 2072SPX on any bounces thereafter (ideally below 2064), then we are likely heading down to the 1980SPX region to complete the larger degree a-wave of wave 4 by the end of August. From there, I would be looking for a month long corrective rally in the b-wave of wave 4, which would then set up the c-wave down to the low to mid 1800 region to complete wave 4 in the fall. So, as I have been saying for weeks now, I need the market to finally make a decision between one of these patterns on the table, so that I can set up a trade for the next larger 200-plus-point move in the S&P500. The upcoming week ""should"" see the market finally chose a direction. See charts illustrating the wave counts on the S&P 500.

AAXN,"Taser International Inc. on Thursday posted a 57% increase in its second-quarter profit as higher revenue driven by its body-cameras segment helped results. More police agencies have equipped officers with body cameras as demand for police accountability and transparency becomes greater. Taser, known for its stun guns, has moved to expand its Axon brand to combine its body cameras with the technology from its video management system. Within its Axon segment, which includes Taser's body cameras, revenue increased to $8.8 million from $4.5 million in the previous year. In addition to an increase in sales, the company said Axon's revenue increase benefited from a sharp rise in licenses for its video management system through Evidence.com and other service revenue. Total service revenue jumped to $2.96 million from $907,000 in the previous year. Within its weapons segment, revenue rose to $37.8 million from $32.7 million. Overall, for the period ended June 30, Taser posted a profit of $6.1 million, or 11 cents a share, up from $3.9 million, or 7 cents a share a year ago. Sales rose 26% to $46.7 million from $37.2 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had projected 9 cents of profit on $46 million on revenue. Shares rose 1.8% in recent trading.

NEW YORK (MarketWatch)—The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average ended slightly higher on Wednesday, scoring their 47th and 30th record closes this year, respectively. Trading on Wall Street was thin with many participants taking off early for the Thanksgiving holiday. Markets will reopen on Friday for a shortened session ending at 1 p.m. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  closed 5.74 points, or 0.3%, higher at 2,072.77. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07%  added 12.81 points, or 0.1%, to 17,827.75. Gains were led by telecoms and technology sector stocks, but a big drop in energy companies’ shares capped the advance. Energy sector stocks sold off due to falling oil prices, driven by concerns about what the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will do about oil oversupplies.

Market reaction to mostly disappointing economic reports was muted, as much of the data were shrugged off as volatile and in some cases backward looking. Need to Know: Happy wealthy Thanksgiving and steer clear of Herbalife Eric Wiegand, senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, described Wednesday’s action as ‘big data, little action’. “It looks like investors are more worried about holiday travels than about economic data. The U.S. economy is muddling through, but it is still doing better than our biggest European and Asian trading partners,” Wiegand said. Economic reports on Wednesday were mostly disappointing. Weekly jobless claims spiked to the highest level in 11 weeks, in a sign that hiring may have slowed down a bit. Consumer spending climbed by less than expected in October, while inflation remained below the Federal Reserve’s target rate of 2%. Durable-goods orders rose, but thanks largely to orders for military aircraft. U.S. Economy Soars, but Wage Growth Lags The Chicago purchasing-managers index for November fell, due to a sharp drop in new orders.

Sales of new single-family homes ticked up 0.7% in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 458,000, the fastest pace in five months, the government reported Wednesday. Meanwhile, a gauge of pending home sales fell 1.1% in October, signaling that upcoming deals could slow down, the National Association of Realtors reported Wednesday. Long the S&P 500, and oil worries: Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG, has pointed out that funds are running the second-lowest short positions in S&P 500 futures for the year, while the cash market shows 88% of stocks are now above their 50-day moving average. That figure stood at 13% in mid-October, he said in a note. This isn’t screaming “selloff”, as 20% of companies are still trading below their 200-day moving averages, said Weston in a note.

AAXN,"Taser International Inc. TASR on Thursday sharply lowered prices for certain camera and software products used by police, citing a tight budgetary environment. Shares of the Scottsdale, Ariz., company, which had hit a nearly six-year high of $17.16 in Wednesday trading, were recently off 9.4% to $15.08. The company lowered the price of its AXON flex police cameras to $499 from $949, while Taser's cloud-based digital-evidence management system Evidence.com has lowered its prices to start at $9.95 a month. Taser said the new pricing addresses the primary challenges with enterprise cameras and software in a tight budgetary environment--affordability and predictability. ""Every officer deserves protection and price should not be a barrier,"" said Evidence.com President Jason Droege. Taser is known for its namesake device, an electroshock weapon used by some police forces to disable violent people. The company's shares have surged since August amid reports that a U.S. District Court judged ordered New York City police to pilot body-worn police cameras, a move that was seen as a potentially significant opportunity for Taser's video products. The stock has risen 69% since the start of the year.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Shares of Taser International Inc. and Smith & Wesson Holdings Corp. headed in different directions Thursday as the stun-gun maker fell following a disappointing sales outlook while the firearms firm gained on a growing backlog and expectations for its current fiscal year. Taser TASR fell almost 5% to $3.37 after the company announced that it expects second-quarter sales of about $18.5 million, well below the $25.6 million average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet Research. The company cited delays in international orders and slower domestic sales due to decreased stimulus funding for law enforcement. Chief Executive Rick Smith said he was ""disappointed"" with the expected revenue, but that deals with foreign buyers ""remain active"" and he expects new products in the pipeline to boost 2011 performance. The company touts its ""nonlethal"" technology as an alternative to police use of deadly force, though its products have been linked to multiple deaths. Eric Wold of Merriman Curhan Ford cut his rating on the company to neutral from buy on a price target of $3.70, despite Taser's ""dominant position"" in the field of less-lethal devices. Wold cited a delay in revived demand since ""economic and budget woes are lingering longer than expected."" Smith & Wesson SWHC jumped 7% to $4.37. Late Wednesday, the company reported that its fiscal fourth-quarter profit fell to $2.7 million, or 4 cents a share, from $7.4 million, or 14 cents a share, in the same period a year ago. But revenue rose to $103.8 million from $99.5 million. The average estimate of analysts polled by FactSet Research had been for the company to earn 4 cents a share on revenue of $98.7 million. But, Smith & Wesson noted that its total backlog at the end of the quarter had grown to $143.1 million, up 23% from the previous quarter, largely on the back of brisk demand for its new BodyGuard line of personal protection handguns that feature integrated laser sights. ""Although the period of heightened consumer demand, which began in fiscal 2009, subsided in mid-fiscal 2010, we grew our firearm sales, supported by a broad product portfolio that was strengthened with new products,"" said Michael Golden, chief executive, in the earnings report. Further, the company rolled out a sales target for the current fiscal year of $430 million to $445 million, compared with the latest actual annual top line of $406.2 million. Following the results, Rommel Dionisio of Wedbush Securities reiterated an outperform rating on shares of Smith & Wesson, noting that the ""sharp increase in order backlog reflects stabilization and demand for upcoming product launches"" while ""the recent Supreme Court decision striking down an existing ban on handgun ownership could be a long-term driver for the handgun industry."" Merriman's Wold bumped his rating on the company to buy from neutral. ""Not only do we continue to have confidence in the long-term growth opportunities for the firearms industry [and Smith & Wesson's ability to gain market share], but now believe that recent clouds regarding normalized firearms growth trends, risk to USR guidance as well as potentially restrictive legislation are all passed -- clearing the path for both improving sales trends as well as margin expansion,"" he said. ""With the improved backlog outlook and visibility it brings, we are now comfortable once again moving off the sidelines and recommending purchase of the shares at current levels.""

AAXN,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- It was the worst of times, and it was the worst of times. Say goodbye, and good riddance, to the Zeroes. For ordinary American investors this was the worst decade on record -- even worse than the 1930s, says Standard & Poor's analyst Howard Silverblatt. In real purchasing power terms, someone who invested in the market index ten years ago has lost nearly a third of their money. But however badly your decade went, here's the good news: Chances are you did better than investors in the Frontier Microcap mutual fund. Next Year's Big IPOs Last week the 87 investors who were left voted to wind this sucker up and distribute what was left in the pot. You can see why. Total investment return over the past decade: minus-99%. No, that's not a typo. Someone who started out with $1,000 in the fund at the start of this decade is left with enough for a few beers. They probably need it. One should be wary of superlatives. This isn't the worst investment fund of the decade -- Mr. Madoff lost 100%. But it's close. It did well briefly, during the dotcom bubble. Then it crashed with the market. Freedom Investors, run by Joel Blumenschein and Amy Siesennop, has been managing the fund since 2002, after the previous manager, James Fay, died. What's happened since? ""The value of the stock picks in the portfolio lost value,"" Siesennop, Freedom Investors' vice-president, explained, somewhat superfluously. ""The stock picks deteriorated "" No kidding. Blumenschein adds a bit of context. The fund's main problem was simply that it was so small, he said. The peak asset figure was just around $1.5 million. As a result its costs were too high compared to its assets (it is much more expensive to run a small fund than a large fund). Frontier Microcap's expense ratio was a staggering 18%, and even at that level Freedom Investors was losing money. ""Real performance did fine,"" insisted Blumenschein. ""But once you throw (in) the expenses ... it got killed."" Either way, $1,000 get you $10. Call it symbolic. Frontier Microcap is my nominee for Mutual Fund of the Decade. It began with high hopes, and it turned into a disaster. Everybody lost. Most disastrous funds are small ones you've never heard of (unless you're an investor, in which case you merely wish you'd never heard of them). But for the last decade there's one exception to the rule: Fidelity Growth Strategies FDEGX, +1.23% You don't expect to see a fund managed by Fidelity Investments, the blue chip money firm in Boston, lose an average of 9.5% a year for a decade. To put that in graphic terms: Anyone who backed this fund ten years ago with a $10,000 stake is holding less than $3,700 today. ""It's pretty bad,"" says Katie Rushkewicz, fund analyst at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. ""The 10-year numbers are terrible."" She blames a double whammy. First, the fund went overboard on technology stocks at the start of the decade and got crushed. And while the latest manager -- Steve Calhoun, who took over in 2005 -- has been an improvement, he hasn't really made up the ground. Look on the bright side: The fund can now carry these past losses forward for tax purposes. That may shelter subsequent profits -- should they materialize. When asked for comment, Fidelity Investments noted the fund's performance has improved in recent years. Heroes of the Zeroes But enough about the losers. The decade had some winners, too. Among diversified (non-sector) U.S. stock funds, many of the best performing were those focused on small company stocks, especially those with a so-called ""value"" orientation, which means the investors focus on hard on old-fashioned measures like low price-to-earnings ratios and dividends. Many small value stocks were being ignored ten years ago, which is why they have done so well since. Top performing funds, according to Lipper, include RS Investors Partners RSPFX, +1.78% a small-cap value fund that has turned $10,000 into $36,400 over the decade, and Bridgeway Ultra Small Company BRUSX, +1.96% $35,400. Bridgeway founder John Montgomery says his fund -- which is closed to new investors -- targets tiny companies, meaning those worth some $200 million or less. At that level, it's often possible to find bargains. The stocks are simply too small to attract much, if any, attention from Wall Street analysts. Bridgeway is a ""quant shop"" -- they invest on the basis of computer models, which screen stocks mainly on company fundamentals. Sometimes they can find stocks just before they grow big enough to attract that attention: One big win this decade, says Mr. Montgomery, was Taser International Inc. TASR RS Investments says it focuses on buying businesses with improving fundamentals. Big wins of the decade range from Correction Corporation of America CXW, -0.56% to recently, back-from-the-brink insurer XL Capital XL, -0.16% Joe Wolf, one of the firm's portfolio managers, says the key to long-term returns is that ""it's not that we make a lot more money when the market is going up, it's that we lose a lot less when the market is going down."" And this is the point where I get to sound like Edward G. Robinson in ""The Cincinnati Kid."" You were good, guys. Real good. But you weren't the best, see? So who was the real Hero of the Zeroes? Step forward Ken Heebner at CGM Focus CGMFX, +1.58% Yes, he's had a disaster in the last 18 months -- he turned bullish just before the crash, and his fund plummeted as a result. But his longer term numbers still shine: Over 10 years he's gained an average of 18.8% a year, turning $10,000 into a golden $56,000. His biggest wins were astute commodity and emerging market bets through 2006-2007. Heebner has declined repeated requests for an interview. Little wonder: He appeared on the front cover of Fortune in mid-2008, just before his fund fell flat on his face. But his record is a timely reminder that going against the herd has advantages, even though it also has its costs and risks.

AAXN,"LOS ANGELES (TechTrader) -- A stock market that looks to be topping at least short-term makes trading on the long side rather nerve-racking, but some stocks with extremely strong technicals should not be overlooked by traders with a longer time horizon. The following are seven stocks setting up for potential intermediate- to longer-term (three- to six-month) moves, and although they may be a bit short-term overbought and the market may be due for a retracement of the recent strong run-up, they're worth monitoring for potential entry points, especially on low-volume pullbacks to support. Taser Looking at the daily chart of Taser TASR going back two years, you can see a large narrowing coil-type pattern has formed. The stock recently has been thrusting back up to test the major declining tops lines and key overhead resistance. Technicals are surging and positively diverging, indicating this stock may want to break out and create a new intermediate- to long-term uptrend. Key overhead resistance at the October high at around 10.20 may be tested next. Beyond that a move above the February-April double-top up near 11.30 - 11.35, which is secondary resistance, on strong volume could get Taser going again. Targets would be the mid-teens intermediate-term and beyond that a move to the low-20s is possible. Short-term support is at 8. IDM Pharma IDM Pharma IDMI is another stock on the move. This junior biotech, which had been in a seven-year down-channel, exploded in early April through its declining tops line and out across the mid-year 2005 and spring 2006 resistance highs around 6.5. The stock then backed off and formed a very distinct pennant pattern, which was followed by another breakout last Friday, although the stock pulled back on Tuesday. The technicals, however, look great, and IDM could reach our initial trading target in the 13 range on an intermediate basis, with our longer-term projection in the 18-19 range. Short-term support is in the 6.5-7 zone. Research Frontiers Research Frontiers REFR, +1.88% also broke out recently, thrusting out of a two-year base pattern on strong volume at the very end of January. The stock followed through in early February and then backed off very bullishly on low volume, holding the 8.25 - 8.5 area. Since then, REFR has stair-stepped its way up to nominal new highs, reaching as high as 12.75 a couple weeks ago before backing off recently to retest the three-month rising bottoms line and the 40-day moving average. It did this on low volume with the technicals holding up very well. Beneath the current levels, there's strong short-term support around the 8.5 - 9 zone, but targets are 14, 17 and 20 short-, intermediate and longer-term. Nymox Pharmaceutical Breakouts of long bases on strong volume are frequent harbingers of continued price appreciation, and Nymox Pharmaceutical NYMX, -4.51% is another recent breakout stock. Earlier this year the stock broke out of a six-year basing pattern when it surged across key overhead resistance at around 5.75. After a secondary surge, the stock reached as high as 7 before backing and filling in a two-month large pennant-type pattern. That pennant was recently taken out with another surge late last week. The stock backed off at its March high and is currently consolidating, but the target at the top of the intermediate up-channel indicates a move to 9 is possible, my initial trading target. Secondary target is around the 13 area, and longer-term target in the high teens. Moving average and price support is around 5. Ceragon Networks Similarly, Ceragon Networks CRNT, +1.51% just last Friday had a strong price-volume surge out of a three-year base pattern, and as a result hit the top of its nine-month rising channel. It could easily back off and consolidate, but there's a very distinct possibility that the early 2004 highs around 8.75 will be tested in the not-too-distant future. That's my initial trading target, followed by a secondary target around 12 and longer-tem target at 18. Short-term support is around the 6 level and beneath that the trendline and moving averages would be between 5.5 and 5.75. Spectrum Control Spectrum Control SPEC, +21.36% built a nice multi-year base pattern from the low in 2001 through the spring of 2006, and although it had a nominal breakout last summer, it then pulled back in the fall and consolidated, testing the bottom of the nine-month rising channel before a January surge took it to more new multi-year highs. Another pullback/retest on low-volume occurred in February and March before a strong price-volume breakaway gap occurred, with a strong follow-through in early April. Since then the stock has been in a very positive bullish-looking consolidation, and I'm expecting support around the 12 - 12.25 area to hold. Should resistance at 14.85 be taken out, the stock should move to our initial trading target around 17. Intermediate target is in the 20 - 20.5 area, and longer-tem target in the mid-20s. Exide Technologies Finally, Exide Technologies XIDE had a long drop from 24.5 down to under 2.5 from the spring of 2004 to the spring of 2006, after which the stock then turned around, moved up, backed off and retested and formed an 18-month base pattern. In early January the stock began a move, followed by a four-day bullish flag pattern that then resulted in a very strong price-volume surge, taking the stock to new multi-year highs. A brief pullback held support and then the stock made higher highs. It's currently consolidating and near its moving average and trendline. XIDE should make it near the 12 range, my initial trading target, if it gets out over the 9.75 area. Secondary target is at 17 and longer-term target in the low 20s. Price support is at 8.25 - 8.5.

AAXN,"LAS VEGAS (MarketWatch) -- If anyone was looking for insight into 2007 consumer electronics trends at the CES Show this week in Las Vegas they would be sorely disappointed since none emerged. All we saw was a lot of junk and a continuation of confused older trends. Many people thought the most interesting news to hit the Show was actually made at the Macworld event in San Francisco, where Apple AAPL, +0.78% rolled out its iPhone and promptly got threatened for trademark violation by Cisco Systems, the owner of the iPhone moniker. Other than that, the only possible trend was one targeting sobriety since, for some unknown reason, a bunch of consumer-oriented breathalyzers appeared at the Las Vegas show. The most controversial item on display was from the Taser International Inc. TASR which showcased a $300 consumer model of a genuine Taser device that shoots out the little prongs to drop an attacker at a distance. Many critics ask whether such a product should even be available to the public. Curiously, a slew of people attending CES were lined up to get blasted by the thing. I assume this was the only thrill anyone could get from this year's show. Journalists who visited openly complained about the lack of interesting products and specifically carped about the ""mine is bigger than yours"" approach that many of the TV makers were exploiting with various companies showing huge LCD's and plasmas all larger then 100-inches. Claims of the ""world's biggest"" were everywhere making the place look like a carnival sideshow. Probably the most interesting things were in the various Asian pavilions. There was even some company with a AA-cell battery that you activated with water. I'm looking into it since nobody at the booth could come close to explaining how it worked except for the fact that you put water into it. Many of these booths were unfortunately peopled who couldn't speak a single word of English except the words ""yes"" and ""OK."" I suspect a lot of potential business was lost. A few booths had people who thought they could speak English, and that was actually worse since they'd drag you into the booth to practice on you. One company had a universal battery charger that could take any weird battery and through a Rube Goldberg-like mechanism manage to lock onto it, properly adjust the polarity, determine the type of battery and charge it. It's probably too complicated to ever sell well. Again the language barrier was an issue as all I really found out was they had ""many patents."" Overall the big consumer electronics companies had nothing new to show. Most of the buzz seemed to stem from the LG Electronics booth, where the combination Blue-ray/HD-DVD drive was showcased. With a price point expected to exceed $1,000 it will be a while before the HD trend takes over the DVD business. Most people seem happy to use their HD screens to watch standard DVDs, which are affordable. If anyone's seeking investment advice coming out of this show, I'd look at the gaming companies since the town of Las Vegas itself seems to be once again undergoing a building boom with virtually every property putting up new additions. The most ambitious (and weirdest) is the MGM-Mirage project called City Center [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_City_Center], a 66-acre mini-city right across from the Aladdin hotel. Originally budgeted at $4 billion, the project may now cost as much as $9 billion to complete, according to the locals. City Center will incorporate condos, people movers, its own firehouse and police department as well as stores and hotels. It's being built on the recently imploded Boardwalk Casino. If you drive up the street you find the classic old Stardust Hotel boarded up and targeted for demolition. God knows what they'll put there, but I'm sure it will have to be something spectacular and expensive. There seems to be no end in sight for this growth and the desert is still out there waiting to be filled up with more stuff. \ More from MarketWatch Uber for Bikes Could Save Your Commute More Coverage Damn the torpedoes — what could take the S&P 500 to 3,000 What America’s gun fanatics won’t tell you Bloodbath for cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin sheds 10%, now down 40% year-to-date","Jan 11, 2007 2:24 p.m. ET",1,CES was little more than breathalyzers and bad trade booths,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/ces-was-little-more-than-breathalyzers-and-bad-trade-booths

AAXN,"SAN DIEGO (MarketWatch) -- What could analysts be thinking on AMR, parent of American Airlines? Average analyst estimates for earnings next year are 48 cents per share, or a profit of around $80 million. But based on the guidance AMR AMR, -4.53% gave for fuel costs, inflationary expenses, revenue initiatives and cost savings - the closest the airline gets to giving a forecast -- it appears this year's operating loss could be more than $100 million greater than last year's reported loss. How does that result in a profit? Answer: Unless oil prices collapse, it doesn't, which is why its stock is flying (he said, sarcastically) - a theme, you'll soon discover, of today's sermon. And while we're on irrational stocks: Harley Davidson HDI, -1.78% has, for more years than I can recall, left tire marks on anybody who dared be anything but bullish on its prospects. (Present company included.) But those critical of Harley are a hearty bunch. Among them, hedge fund manager John Succo, writing on Minyanville.com, notes that dealer inventories continued to swell as the resale prices on used bikes continued to fall, ""which puts a great deal of pressure on the prices of the new ones,"" he says. Yet beating estimates, he adds, ""caused the earnings surprise guys"" to buy, which drove the stock a few points higher. Of course, it doesn't matter how the company beat those numbers, which were puffed up by stock repurchases the company itself says helped earnings per share rise faster than sales - hardly what you'd call a high quality beat. But since when did quality matter? Not in this market -- that's when! Oh, and by the way, delinquencies on the credit side of the company's business are on the rise. One day, with Harley, all of that may actually matter. More market mania: I go out of my way not to write about the overall market. I don't know any more or less than the average guy in the gutter or the average strategist on the street. But one thing I'm good with (if I don't say so myself) is inflection points. I can say, unequivocally, we're at one now. There is always an inflection point, for example, when I start hearing neophyte investors say that they're hanging onto every word I write - and that they are ""making money"" by shorting stocks merely because they show up in this column with some kind of cautionary statement. That usually means stocks have fallen too quickly, in which case the spring is ready to be sprung on the upside. The other inflection point, which we're at right now, is when stocks I red-flag either here or on TV wind up going higher just because I mention them. At the same time, at this inflection point, bearish sources clam up, I start thinking maybe I ought to throw in the towel and become a coffee barista (how does ""Herb's Hut"" sound?) and investors start thinking they're geniuses as stocks of companies with questionable fundamentals fly for no apparent reason other than they're going up. But just remember: In the past, whenever this has happened - and I've lived through quite a few episodes-- it has been only a matter of time before the market hits one of those unexpected and unpleasant air pockets that remind people that the reality of potential risks should be respected and that hubris (about how easy it is to make money in some of these stocks) can be horribly humbling. Further signs of ridiculous speculation On Thursday I wrote a piece in my subscription newsletter, Herb Greenberg's RealityCheck, about Novastar NFI, +0.90% I've been writing negatively about the subprime mortgage lender for more than three years. This time I noted how someone smart, who has been publicly bearish, turned temporarily bullish. Within a minute of the alert hitting subscriber mailboxes the stock started to zoom higher. Shortly thereafter, blurbs hit rumor wires that ""Herb Greenberg"" had turned ""positive"" on Novastar. No, what Herb Greenberg (otherwise known as I) did was report the conversion of a bear to a short-term bull, how he thinks his prior theory and that of current bears is ""flawed"" and how the current bears think his argument is equally ""flawed."" I also pointed out how the short-term bull agrees with the perma-bears that as credit risks take hold, Novastar's stock is headed considerably lower than it is today. (Which is why it remains red-flagged on the RealityCheck watch list.) Sudden thought: A year ago American Italian Pasta PLB, +0.58% was around $26 headed to an April intraday high of close to $30. Today it's closer to $6. A few years ago, Taser TASR was around $31, post a few splits, on its way to a low later in the year of around $5. And remember Movie Gallery MOVI as it peaked mid-year at around $27 after more-than doubling in a matter of months? Today it's under $6. You just might want to keep those three in mind next time you find yourself smug about a stock whose rise appears to be too good to be true. The trouble with parabolic rises is that what goes up fast has a way of falling even faster. All of which is a long-winded way of saying: Fasten those seatbelts and never mind the air sick bags; they'll be of no use.

There were more than 539 million shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, where declining stocks outpaced rising shares by 18 to 12. More than 645 million shares traded in the Nasdaq market, with 14 advancing shares for every 13 declining stocks. The market closed at 1 p.m. Commodities markets were closed, but stocks, foreign exchange, and Treasurys markets were open. There were no scheduled economic reports to lend direction to trading. All eyes were trained on the retail sector because the Friday after Thanksgiving traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season. Investors are eager for data and anecdotal evidence about how much investors are spending because consumers remain one of the engines of the economy. ""Everyone is trying to get a handle on retail sales to see how good they are,"" said Jim Awad of Awad Asset Management. ""Money managers would like to keep the rally going. If retail sales look good, money managers will look for the market to have a good close for the year."" However, Robert Pavlik, chief investment officer at Oaktree Asset Management, said, ""There is increased concern that the market is getter ahead of itself. We've come so far so fast and the market has not had a chance to consolidate. The question for next week is whether we will get a continuation of the rally or a selloff.""

""Japanese CPI failed to show any inflationary pressures despite the fact that expectations were suggesting otherwise,"" Scrase said. ""Once again this is pushing the Bank of Japan's plans to start tightening monetary policy back somewhat and the return of the dollar to above 119 yen is clearly linked to this news."" Treasurys were rallying, sending yields to their lowest level in nearly four weeks. The gains were linked to expectations that the Federal Reserve could end its interest-rate hiking cycle in early 2006.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) - U.S. stocks closed lower Wednesday, after an attempt at a rally was thwarted by worries over higher borrowing costs and disappointing earnings from Boeing Co., Amazon and Anheuser-Busch Cos. The Dow Jones Industrials Average DJIA, +1.07% ended down 32.89 points at 10,344.98, after flitting back and forth between positive and negative territory many times. However, Dow components Alcoa AA, +1.22% DuPont DD, +2.74% and American Express Co. AXP, +1.16% locked in solid gains. The S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% and the Nasdaq Composite $COMPX closed down 5.16 points at 1,191.38 and down 9.40 points at 2,100.05 after unsteady performances. There were more than 1.82 billion shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange, where falling shares outweighed rising stocks by 21 to 10. Volume in the Nasdaq market was over 1.84 billion stocks; decliners outweighed advancing shares by 17 to 11. Trade was uneven with frequent shifts of direction as every attempt at a rally was met with resistance Tuesday. ""We are still trying to bottom out, but we need a good catalyst,"" said Donald Selkin, director of equity research at Joseph Stevens. However, he said investors were kept in a negative frame of mind owing to sharp gains in interest rates -- jumps in both long and short-term bond yields that have followed the White House's nomination of Ben Bernanke to replace Alan Greenspan at the Fed - as well as weak earnings. Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz, King & Nussbaum described Wednesday's market as ""trading stock by stock and sector by sector."" The stock-price volatility is making investors anxious, but Hyman said he is optimistic that the market is poised for an upswing. Many analysts expect the market to start a rally soon because they think disappointment over third-quarter reports, along with some weak outlooks, have taken too much of a chunk out of stock prices in October. Jeff Kleintop, chief investment strategist at PNC Advisors, said possible catalysts for a late-year market rally include S&P 500 component companies posting double-digit earnings growth for the third quarter and guiding to mid-teens growth for the fourth quarter. Kleintop also noted a large mound of surplus corporate cash ""that is fueling a wave of buybacks, dividend increases, and mergers and acquisitions"" as a possible catalyst. Bond yields soar, energy prices fall However, all eyes Wednesday were on climbing rates. The Treasury market was under pressure due to investor belief that Ben Bernanke, the White House nominee to replace Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve, will continue Greenspan's program of rate increases, Hyman said. See full story. The falling prices pushed the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to a seven-month high of 4.592%. Earlier price declines lifted yields on 2-year notes to their highest since May 2001. The Energy Department reported that motor gasoline stocks were up 200,000 barrels at 195.9 million barrels in the latest week, below expectations. Crude inventories rose for a third consecutive week and distillate supplies fell 1.6 million barrels to 121.1 million, the department said. Crude futures were higher after the inventories data, but later dropped. They lost nearly 3% to close at $60.66 a barrel. See full story.

Gold for December delivery fell from recent highs to close down $1.70 at $473 an ounce. Recent indications of rising inflation have made gold attractive, Hyman said.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- U.S. stocks closed sharply higher Monday, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 posting their biggest one-day gains in six months, after strong earnings and the White House's nomination of administration economist Ben Bernanke as the next Federal Reserve chief. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% closed near its session high, rising 169.78 points to 10,385, locking in its biggest rise since April 21.

Replacing Greenspan The White House nominated Ben Bernanke, a former Fed governor and chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, as the replacement for Greenspan. See full story. With President George Bush at his side in the White House, Bernanke said Monday that he would seek to continue Greenspan's legacy. Read about Greenspan's legacy. Experts said the economist's nomination is likely to win Senate approval. See full story. Analysts had mixed views about the equities- and bond-market implications of the nomination. See full story. ""Bernanke is a strong advocate of inflation targeting, but, as simple and elegant as that sounds, it can prove an unrealistic goal,"" said Peter Morici, a University of Maryland business professor. ""These days, too much of the inflation challenge stems from structural issues beyond the control of the Fed -- for example, hypergrowth in China and the resulting pressures on oil prices, and the mismanagement of energy policy and resulting shortages of refining and natural gas capacity,"" Morici said. James Park, director of institutional trading at Rodman & Renshaw, said the announcement lifted the market by removing an element of uncertainty. ""I would say the news [about a Greenspan replacement] gave the market some incremental gains,"" said Larry Wachtel, a consultant to Wachovia, noting that shares rallied for two hours before the market received word of the announcement.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Shares of Taser International Inc. surged Monday as Jefferies & Co. raised its rating on the stun-gun maker, citing evidence of a business turnaround, growing market opportunities in the U.S. and the U.K., and an attractive valuation. Analyst Matthew McKay upgraded the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company TASR to buy from hold and lifted his price target by $1 to $7. Taser's stock traded up as much as 23.6% to $6.75 in morning trade . The stock closed up 19.4% at $6.52. McKay's rosier outlook is based on checks with a number of U.S. distributors, which show business has firmed up and may turn around by the end of the year. He said one distributor, which experienced a severe drop-off in its business during the first half of they year, reported receiving a significant increase in orders at the end of the September quarter. ""Another distributor highlighted a harder time meeting demand, which we attribute to picked-up demand and leaner inventories after management adjusted inventory levels for the slower business in the first of half of the year,"" said McKay. Meanwhile, a manufacturer of holsters for Tasers pointed to continued healthy demand during the current quarter. Growth opportunities in the U.K. Expectations that the company will be able to grow its U.K market position also fueled McKay's upgrade of Taser. The analyst learned from talks with members of the Association of Chief Police Officers, a U.K police union, that the Minister of State for Crime, Securities and Communities has agreed to meet with it about potentially expanding the use of of the Taser to all non-firearm officers in the country. If the U.K. government decides to move forward with a trial period for use of the gun's by the country's 100,000 non-firearm officers, McKay says, Taser could be looking at an ""$80 million to $100 million revenue opportunity beginning in one to two years."" Currently, the U.K. is in the process of rolling out Taser guns to about 10,000 officers who carry firearms. Among other international opportunities, France is considering arming its officers with Taser guns although ""appears to be one-to-two years behind the U.K,"" said McKay. Outlook for U.S. sales In the U.S., the company can tap into a market in which 600,000 sworn law-enforcement officers could be eligible to use the gun, accoding to data supplied by the Department of Homeland Security. ""Over the next five years, this market segment should provide over $150 million of revenue from new customers, assuming an average sale price of $750 per Taser and the company can reach 50% market penertration from the current 15%."" Cartridge sales, new product launches Cartridge sales for the gun also offer a significant revenue opportunity, said the analyst. Assuming Taser achieves a 50% market share and an average of five cartridges are bought annually per gun, cartridge sales should provide about $27 million of steady annual revenue. ""Given that each certified Taser user must shoot a minimum of two cartridges per year for training purposes, we believe five cartridges per year per Taser is reasonable,"" said McKay. New product introductions offer further reason for optimism, according to the analyst. In particular, the launch of the Taser CAM, a stun-gun that records video once it has been switched to the armed position, could be a significant revenue driver for the company. The company is expected to begin production of this model in the first quarter of 2006. Stun-gun safety Finally, said the analyst, the tone of the debate over the safety of the Taser gun is evolving to the benefit of the company. He said the debate is much more focused on the appropriate situations for using the device rather than the argument over the lethal or non-lethal aspects of the gun. The use of the stun gun has been mired in controversy for a number of years In January, Taser shares plunged after management announced that the company was the subject of a Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into safety statements related to the gun, and recent sales to a distributor. Read more The American Civil Liberties Union has claimed a number of deaths in the U.S. and Canada can be linked to police use of the gun. Amnesty International, meanwhile, said the use of Tasers should be suspended pending a rigorous, independent investigation into their safety. Since the start of the year, Taser's shares have plunged more than 80% on those safety concerns. Disclosing its interest in the company, Jefferies & Co said it makes a market in shares of the company. Making a market is when a brokerage holds an inventory of stock in a particular company to allow it to fill customer orders quickly.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) - Shares of Taser International slumped Tuesday after the stun-gun maker said a previously disclosed Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry is now formal. The stock closed down 96 cents, or 13%, to $6.35. The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company TASR also said the SEC's probe has been expanded to include examination of ""the possible unauthorized acquisition of material non-public information"" by individuals outside the company in an effort to manipulate the price of Taser stock. The formal designation of the inquiry gives the SEC subpoena power to obtain documents and testimony from all parties it deems relevant. For its part, Taser said it plans to supply the SEC with all materials it requests and continue to fully cooperate with the probe, first disclosed in early January. At that time, Taser said it was compiling information for the SEC related to the safety of its products, and a then-recent order from Davidson's Inc. ""We recognize that this has been a difficult process for our employees and shareholders,"" said Rick Smith, the company's CEO, in a statement. ""We continue to make all efforts to assist the SEC in completing their investigation as expeditiously as possible."" Smith went on to say he hopes the SEC will look into recent data that indicate the existence of what he termed ""a large improper, naked short position in Taser International stock."" The stock has been extremely volatile in the past year, running within a range of $33.45 on Dec. 30 to its prior 52-week low of $7.11 set last Friday.

AAXN,"(Editor's note: This is a free version of Herb Greenberg's RealityCheck. For more information on how to subscribe to his paid newsletter, click here.) SAN DIEGO (MarketWatch) -- Americans think the press is too critical of America. That's the word from the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press. They were talking about political coverage, but they might as also be referring to business reporting. That's the same message I get more often than you would believe from readers who, for whatever reason, think that questioning the quality of a company's earnings or doubting management is akin to trying to rip apart the very things that make America great. I've thought about it (for a second) and I think they're right. From here on out...it's an all new me. No more negative news. So, when it comes to oil of $60 a barrel, who cares? The higher the price, the higher inflation and the more the economy will get strangled, which means the Fed eventually will stop raising interest rates, which is supposed to be good for stocks! Jarden JAH doing yet another acquisition of an appliance company -- one of the toughest industries I know? No worries. It resets the cost-savings clock, which helps the company continue to churn out that high earnings growth. Don't worry if the earnings we're talking about are low-quality and unsustainable. They're earnings -- and that's all that counts! Apollo Group's APOL, -1.69% growth continuing to slow? Oh, please, it's still an impressive number so the trend is irrelevant. Besides, everybody loves this stock so it must be good. Amazon AMZN, +1.11% is entering the liquidation business to compete with Overstock OSTK, -0.96% ? Isn't that added competition? Nah, it's actually a positive, as one analyst wrote, because it'll expand the market. Several closed end funds, such as the Gabelli Utility Trust GUT, +2.81% and the Cornerstone Strategic Fund CRF, +0.53% which trade at the highest premiums of any closed end fund, paying out dividends that mostly amount to a return of investor money? But that means you pay less taxes! Another person dies after being hit by police with a gun made by Taser TASR ? My sympathies, but think about how many people haven't died. In this new world order: There's no news but good news, which is why a glass half full has just as few calories as a glass half empty. Now...imagine how the world would be if that were your daily dish of news. Don't know about you: I know I'd rather not. With that behind us: Got this email from a guy who wrote: ""Great call on Jarden on Mad Money. Stock is up $5.68 today."" Indeed it was after Jarden announced it was acquiring a privately held appliance maker. Yet another reader whose life is consumed, no doubt, by the ""trade."" He must've either avoided buying Jarden or sold it after watching me last week on Jim Cramer's Mad Money on CNBC without doing an ounce of his own research. (I'm still amazed, after all of my years of doing this, how many people want others to tell them what to buy or sell.) As for Jarden, I was throwing up a few of the red flags I had mentioned in my subscription newsletter, Herb Greenberg's RealityCheck. The difference between the two venues: TV is a minute or two; the story, which he no doubt didn't read, was nearly 1,800 words. And I wouldn't change a word of what I wrote - or what I said! And what I wrote, in summary, is that Jarden is an acquisitive hodge-podge of big, boring (but well-known) companies that would be earning little or next to nothing if it weren't for cost savings tied to the acquired companies, which include Sunbeam -- in the past the kiss of death to anybody who has dared touch it. The company says much of the 20% to 25% earnings growth it's expecting over the next few years will come from cost-savings tied to acquired companies. During that time, Jarden has said, it expects to see $75 to $110 million in savings. As a result, I wrote, ""The bigger the company gets, the higher the stock goes and the more the guys running it get hooked on a strategy they can't kick: Acquisitions for the sake of acquisitions so nobody will see that, hype or no hype, growth at Jarden is an illusion."" I believed it then. I believed it now. Short of the entire company getting acquired, one day this will matter. As for Apollo APOL\ -- to repeat some of what I wrote Tuesday on Minyanville.com, where some of my posts now appear: After Apollo reported fiscal third quarter earnings, I checked in with a long-time Apollo short who noted that after taking into account taxes and a slower share count, the company beat expectations by just 1 cent or less than 1% above consensus, which is the smallest ""beat"" in more than three years. This was also the second consecutive quarter the company missed on revenues -- likely the result of higher discounting. In all, revenue growth of 24.5% was the slowest in three years. Cash flow fell considerably while earnings were higher (always a red flag) and consolidated enrollment fell for the fourth straight quarter. Who knows (sounding like the broken record I am on so many companies): One day this too may actually matter. On that note, unless we meet sooner: Have a bang-up Fourth.

Rick Smith, the Scottsdale, Ariz., company's chief executive, said ""significant adverse publicity"" has led to ""a temporary disruption in our sales pipeline."" As a result, ""we decided not to issue financial guidance because of the lack of visibility on our business in light of this controversy."" The average analysts' estimate compiled by Thomson First Call is for sales of $13.6 million and income of 3 cents per share. The stock fell 13 percent to $10.42 in trading Friday. Taser TASR cited recent studies that it said support the view that its hand-held devices, while not risk free, reduce the chances of death. Smith said Taser had formed a team of ""experts"" to defend the company ""against the myriad of erroneous and misleading information in the public domain"" and launched a publicity campaign that includes a users conference in April. Morgan Keegan analyst Brian Ruttenbur cut his 2005 revenue estimate for Taser to $10.1 million and his earnings estimate to breakeven on a per-share basis. Sales to new customers could be weaker, but existing Taser customers will continue to use the products, Ruttenbur predicted. He reiterated an ""underperform"" rating and withdrew sales and earnings estimates for 2006.

AAXN,"LONDON (MarketWatch) -- U.S. stock futures lifted early Friday after weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs growth in March sent welcome signals to the market about the probable pace of interest rate hikes.

AAXN,"Corrects percent decline in Sirius stock SAN FRANCISCO (MarketWatch) -- Attacking the bearer of bad news is a human custom with a rich history. In practice, it's an often brutal one, as the fate of killjoys from John the Baptist to Sir Thomas More attests. Business journalists don't cover life and death issues and aren't martyr candidates, so relaying unflattering facts about public companies doesn't carry the deadly consequences of telling a king he shouldn't have married his wife. But while having your inbox filled with irate emails isn't in the same league as losing your head, it is a reminder that investors who fall in love with a stock and then are confronted with bad news about it often choose to savage the messenger, rather than evaluate his message. I was reminded of this last month after writing an analysis which argued that Qwest Communications International Q, +0.00% judging by its relative financial health, is a weaker suitor for MCI MCIP than Verizon Communications. VZ, -0.37% As evidence, I cited Qwest's heavy debt load -- a fact I'd gleaned directly from its most recent regulatory filing -- and its puny revenue compared to Verizon's. Because the story broke no new ground, I was surprised to get passionate emails from readers (whom I assumed were Qwest shareholders) asking why I had it in for the company. The questions ranged from the cordial ""why can't you give Qwest a break?"" to the ironically humorous ""do you own MCI stock?"" The latter one is ironic because as someone who's signed the Dow Jones & Co. employee code of ethics, I'm prohibited from owning the stocks of any companies I write about. That complaint called to mind the dozens of responses I'd received in December from investors in SIRI, +1.05% Sirius Satellite Radio. They were enraged, even though I merely relayed the opinion of some analysts who thought the shares' rapid rise in the wake of Howard Stern's signing had gone too far. One reader accused me of owning shares of XM Satellite Radio XMSR Sirius' biggest rival. Notice a pattern here? The shoot-the-messenger reaction seems to be strongest among investors who own stock in companies with reputations for being an upstart brand. Besides Sirius, other examples include Taser International TASR and Krispy Kreme Doughnuts KKD Taser, after all, is out to revolutionize how law enforcement subdues suspects. Sirius, meanwhile, plans to poke a finger in the eye of big corporate radio firms like ClearChannel Communications. Krispy Kreme, like its products, apparently appeals to those in open rebellion against the low-carb craze. ""Tell me I can't eat myself into obesity, will you? Take that!"" investors seemed to be saying, as they loaded up on Krispy Kreme shares early last year. Investors' passion for these stocks is understandable. Americans love an underdog, after all. The problem is that passion is no help when you own shares of a company whose run is over. Sirius shares are down more than 40 percent since early December, while Taser shares have plummeted more than 60 percent in three months and Krispy Kreme is down more than 70 percent since last April. Yet a portion of shareholders in those companies still believe that Herb Greenberg, who writes a column for MarketWatch, is somehow responsible for their losses. Greenberg fought a running battle for months with Krispy Kreme shareholders who were convinced that it was he - and not the company's unsustainable growth - that put the bruising on their portfolios. Given the stock drop, it's no surprise that Krispy Kreme's chief executive stepped down in January. What is surprising -- given the corporate scandals at Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and Adelphia, among others -- is that investors still cling to statements made by company executives as if they were gospel, even while attacking the bearers of bad news. What investors forget is that corporate officers have a responsibility to NOT say anything negative about their company and, except in very rare cases, always accentuate the positive. Think about it. Among the thousands of public company executives out there, who among them gets paid to say bad things about the firms they run? It may be springtime, but investors would do well to remember that when it comes to their portfolios, falling in love can be an expensive mistake.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Taser International shares shot up more than 22 percent in Thursday trading after reports from a medical journal and the Pentagon asserted the company's stun guns are safe. Taser's TASR stock added $3.79 to finish at $20.80. The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based maker of ""less-lethal"" weapons said a cardiac safety study published in the Pacing and Clinical Electrophysiology Journal found that Tasers had an ""extraordinarily wide safety margin"" for causing heart fibrillations. Dr. Richard Luceri, a cardiologist and member of Taser's medical advisory board, said in a statement the company's stun guns have a greater margin of safety than most cardiac drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Meanwhile, the Department of Defense said a study conducted by the Air Force Research Laboratory found that Tasers do not have a ""significant risk of unintended severe effects."" However, the ACLU and Amnesty International said the studies still cast doubts on Taser's safety claims and urged local police departments to re-evaluate their use or purchase of the weapons based on safety concerns. The ACLU said 89 deaths in the U.S. and Canada have been linked to police use of Tasers. Amnesty International said the use of Tasers should be suspended pending a rigorous, independent investigation into their safety. ""The deaths have generally involved people whose hearts are already at greater risk of fatal ventricular fibrillation because they've ingested drugs or alcohol, are in severe mental distress, or are very pumped with adrenaline,"" said John Crew, an ACLU lawyer and police practices expert. ""The question is -- and always has been -- how Taser shocks interact with these other 'at risk' factors in these deaths. That's why we need more study."" The PACE journal and Pentagon reports followed Wednesday's endorsement of Tasers by a Miami-Dade County panel of county commissioners. The grand jury ""strongly recommended"" the use of Tasers by police in their ""confrontations and dangerous encounters with mentally ill subjects."" Taser's stock lost almost half its value between Jan. 6 and Tuesday's close, following a series of disclosures that rattled investors. Among the issues battering Taser's shares was its Jan. 6 statement that it was cooperating with an informal Securities and Exchange Commission probe into its safety statements and a sale to a distributor. Additionally, on Tuesday the company warned that it may see some delays in orders in the first half of fiscal 2005, as customers test and evaluate potential rivals' products. One would-be rival, Stinger Systems Inc. STIY which trades on the pink sheets, has seen its shares move in inverse proportion to Taser's. That company's stock plunged 35 percent Wednesday to close at $30, while Taser's shares added 21 percent to $17.01 after the Miami grand jury's endorsement. Stinger's stock lost more than 18 percent to $24.50 Thursday.

AAXN,"SAN DIEGO (CBS.MW) -- When dealing with Taser it appears even the company's top execs don't necessarily know all the details about things they're commenting on. In a follow-up to my column from Tuesday, which pointed to a possible conflict of interest between Taser and a former officer in the Minneapolis police department, USA Today Wednesday pointed out that Taser paid stock options to four ""active"" police officers who are part of its training board. The paper says it received the information from Taser president Tom Smith. Funny, because in his interview with me earlier this week Smith said options were only paid to employees, ""down to production workers."" Why the change of heart? In a brief interview Wednesday Smith says he was driving during the original interview and didn't have all information at hand. (So why guess?) As it turns out, in its 10-K Taser TASR says options were also paid to consultants. How many consultants? In addition to the four active officers, Smith says, they went to a patent attorney and a medical adviser as well as ""three others"" on the training board. One, he says, was a retired cop. Who are the others? According to the company's 10-K, the training board includes another active police officer and a ""representative from the commercial airline industry."" Did they get options as well? And what airline does the airline employee work for? In an e-mail response to those questions, Smith said, ""Due to privacy requirements and regulation FD, we cannot provide any information beyond what is contained in our public statements and is consistent with what I provided to you this morning."" Thursday thwack Medicine for Medicis: Medicis Pharmaceutical MRX which has plenty of fans on Wall Street for its knack of always meeting or beating earnings estimates, went on the yellow-flag list of my subscription newsletter, Herb Greenberg's RealityCheck, on Nov. 8 when its stock was $39. (And, for now, there it will stay!) The concern at the time was the drug company's dispute with BioMarin Pharmaceutical BMRN, +1.82% which claimed Medicis overcharged BioMarin for the rights and option to buy Orapred, a pediatric asthma drug. After the deal closed, BioMarin found the Orapred sales (and therefore sales price) had been artificially pumped up by a distribution channel that was stuffed with more inventory than BioMarin imagined. BioMarin sued Medicis, which is best known for wrinkle-corrector Restalyn. The suit was then dropped and the two settled the dispute out of court. They finally reached an agreement this week, reducing the licensing payments on Orapred starting ""after"" July; Medicis also reduced the price it will charge BioMarin to buy all of Orapred, and it agreed to lend up to $25 million to BioMarin, via a convertible note. All of this is a long-winded way to say: It appears Medicis did indeed try to make the Orapred market look stronger than it really is. Orapred's stock, which had tumbled to around $32 before the deal was announced, lifted slightly on the news and now trades at around $34. My original source, a money manger who is short Medicis, continues to be bearish. ""Now I think the headwind for them next year is virtually impossible to overcome, short of an acquisition,"" he says. Not only is there brewing competition for Restalyn, but the company will now get incrementally less licensing revenue from BioMarin. (Note the price paid by BioMarin doesn't get rolled back until July, which would appear to be convenient timing for Medicis from the meeting or beating estimates vantage point.) Medicis will also have to come up with an encore to fill BioMarin's licensing revenue, which was already scheduled to fall sharply next year. As I mentioned in RealityCheck, in the wake of the BioMarin fiasco you can bet that future buyers of anything from Medicis are likely to take a closer look at what they're really getting. Final point: My year-end report card's ""incomplete"" on NovaStar NFI, +0.90% didn't go over well (surprise, surprise) with the NovaStar noisemakers, which have bombarded me with e-mails pointing out ""how much money people would've lost"" if they had followed my ""recommendation"" to short NovaStar two years ago. The only problem with that comment: this column does not make recommendations; it points out risks or situations that are otherwise overlooked. It's then up to readers to decide whether to sell the stock (if they own it), avoid it (if they're considering owning it), ignore what I've written or, if they're so inclined, make a negative bet on a company. (For the record: I think shorting, by the average investor, is like playing with fire. Too many risks and nuances.) As for NovaStar, I wouldn't change a word in any item I've written regarding the company. The beat, as they say, goes on.

The Scottsdale, Ariz. stun-gun maker made the disclosure in an open letter to shareholders and customers -- which the company normally only publishes in conjunction with it annual report -- intended to ease investors' concerns amid an informal Securities and Exchange Commission inquiry into the safety of its less-than-lethal weapons and the timing of a sale to a distributor. Since its disclosure of the informal SEC inquiry, Taser shares have plummeted 49 percent from its closing Jan. 6, including a drop Monday of 11.8 percent. After the markets closed Jan. 6, Taser said it was cooperating with the informal SEC inquiry into its safety statements, as well as a sale to distributor Davidson Inc. The sale raised the eyebrows of at least one analyst, Gradient Analytics' Rob Miceli, given that it came just 11 days before the end of the quarter, possibly allowing the company to meet its fourth-quarter and full-year revenue forecasts. Potential Taser competitors include Stinger Systems STIY shares of which advanced more than 9 percent to $46 in Tuesday pink-sheets trading; and Law Enforcement Associates LENF which shed more than 25 percent to $8.10, after trading as high as $12.64 earlier in the session. Morgan Keegan told clients in a note Tuesday that although it's maintaining its ""market perform"" rating on the stock and likes its long-term prospects, it has concerns regarding the SEC inquiry, as well as rivals' product offerings. ""We are also concerned that potential competition may slow down Taser sales to the law enforcement community in the first half of 2005,"" said the broker in a note. ""We see some competition coming into the company's market in the next few of months. We believe that despite these new entrants, Taser will continue to penetrate domestic and international markets."" Insider sales defended In addition, Taser disclosed insider sales, in which Phil Smith, who retired as chairman Dec. 31, sold most of the Taser stock he owned. The company said Smith sold the shares as part of his transition to retirement. Meanwhile, co-founders Tom Smith and Rick Smith sold about 22 percent of their respective Taser share holdings in the fourth quarter. ""We still retain a significant majority of our personal assets,"" Tom Smith and Rick Smith said in the letter. ""Hence, we feel that the rumors about us 'bailing out' are not fair, nor accurate."" Executives at Taser International have profited well from the company's sharp stock swings over the past year, despite controversial news reports about the company's main product. According to insider trading data from Thomson Financial, executives and board members at Taser sold more than $125 million of shares during 2004. In the previous year, insider sales totaled about $17.3 million, according to Thomson data. The bulk of those sales came in November, as Taser shares crossed into record territory above $30, on a split-adjusted basis. Insiders sold off $61.6 million of shares during the month. Members of the company's founding family have made the most profitable insider transactions this year. Chairman Phillips Smith and sons Patrick and Thomas -- who serve as the company's CEO and president, respectively -- sold about $105 million of shares in 2004. A portion of those shares were acquired through the exercise of options. The stock made sharp swings in both directions last year as news of new contracts was offset by reports questioning the safety of the company's products. On November 8, Taser shares jumped 16 percent after its stun guns were cleared for use aboard planes by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. That gain was offset by a New York Times article later in the month reporting an unreleased government study that reportedly found the company's stun guns to be dangerous in certain circumstances.","Jan 11, 2005 6:03 p.m. ET",1,Taser's stock craters; warns of  potential order delays,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/tasers-stock-craters-warns-of-potential-order-delays
AAXN,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - Stocks tumbled Tuesday as disappointing numbers from Alcoa and several warnings in the technology sector sparked concerns about fourth-quarter profits as reporting season began. ""We went into this earnings season following a very benign preannouncement season so people started to believe that my company didn't pre-announce and therefore everything should be fine,"" said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. That changed, he said, with Alcoa's weaker-than-expected report and preannouncements from Advanced Micro Devices and STMicroelectronics. ""[They] woke people up to the fact that just because you don't pre-announce doesn't mean that you're not going to have anything negative to say,"" Boockvar said. The tech warnings, especially, unnerved investors who were waiting to hear what Intel Corp. would reveal when it reported after the closing bell. (After the bell, Intel Corp. INTC, +5.00% posted a slight drop in fourth-quarter earnings to 33 cents despite a 13 percent gain in revenue to $9.6 billion. The recent quarter included a tax benefit of 3 cents per share. Analysts were expecting earnings of 31 per share on revenue of $9.4 billion. Intel shares lost 1.5 percent ahead of the report.) The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% closed down 64.81 points, or 0.6 percent, at 10,556.22 while the Nasdaq Composite Index $COMPQ skidded 17.42 points, or 0.8 percent, to 2,079.62 and the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% shed 7.26 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,182.99. Decliners led advancers 5 to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange and 11 to 5 on the Nasdaq. Big Board volume was about 1.48 billion shares while some 2.22 billion shares traded on the Nasdaq. Within the Dow, only 3M MMM, +1.38% and United Technologies UTX, +1.10% managed gains. 3M climbed 0.9 percent after Deutsche Bank raised its stock price target to $95 from $90 and said it expects the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape to post earnings that at least meet and possibly beat expectations when it reports Jan. 18. Hewlett-Packard HPQ, +1.06% was the Dow's biggest decliner, sliding 3.7 percent after Morgan Stanley slammed the computer hardware maker with a downgrade. The broker cut its recommendation to ""underweight,"" saying competition from Dell Inc. DELL and continued signs of supply chain inefficiencies increase the chance for near-term business execution missteps. But the focus was really on earnings as Alcoa kicked off the reporting season with a weaker-than-expected report. ""One of the big worries about 2005 is how earnings are going to do,"" said Al Goldman, chief market strategist at A.G. Edwards. ""The news is scary when a company [Alcoa], despite product prices being up, has lower earnings due to higher energy costs and interest rate costs,"" he added. Whether Wall Street takes Alcoa's report as a company specific issue or a universal problem will be determined by the mood of investors, he said. ""If investors remain in a glass-is-half-full attitude, then they will assume it's company specific, but if investors decide to get grouchy, they're going to go into a mood of the glass is half empty and they're going to worry overall."" Right now, he noted, the mood is basically optimistic, though it has deteriorated a bit because of the poor market start this year. Shares of the aluminum giant AA, +1.22% stumbled 2.7 percent after it said fourth-quarter profit fell 8 percent, despite higher prices for its aluminum, because of the cost of selling assets, decreased production at its Quebec smelter and higher materials costs. Its report of fourth-quarter earnings of 39 cents a share from continuing operations, excluding one-time items, was 2 cents shy of analysts' forecasts. See full story. Advanced Micro AMD, +2.45% meanwhile, said it expected fourth-quarter sales to be ""up slightly"" from the $1.24 billion it posted in the previous quarter. Analysts polled by Thomson First Call had expected AMD to post sales of $1.35 billion, on average, for the quarter. See full story. At least four brokers downgraded the stock, which plunged 26 percent. Strategists were concerned about the disappointing start to earnings season but weren't ready to write off the remainder of the reporting period. ""I wouldn't want to base a new down market or another negative trend developing on the backs of Alcoa or AMD,"" said Barry Hyman, equity market strategist at Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. As the season progresses, Hyman thinks markets may start to see some counterbalance to these early-stage earnings. ""Even though there may be some downside in the near term, I think once we get deeper into the earnings season ... a lot of the concern as to earnings growth and GDP growth for 2005 will dissipate and the market will right itself and start another uptrend,"" he added. European-based chipmaker ST Microelectronics STM, +0.63% meanwhile, also warned that fourth-quarter margins would fall short of forecasts. Its shares fell 4.3 percent. See full story. More caution in the tech sector came from Unisys Corp.

AAXN,"Editor's note: Corrects typographical error in 14th paragraph. SAN DIEGO (CBS.MW) -- Taser's stock has been stunned in recent days by news the SEC was probing the safety of its products and a recent order from a distributor. In a letter to shareholders Tuesday morning, the company said the inquiry ""may not be resolved quickly."" While regulators are at it, they might as well see if the company is properly disclosing its relationship with customers. In late December, Minneapolis television station WCCO reported the Minneapolis police launched an internal investigation of its stun gun point man who was also paid by Taser TASR to train users outside of the department. The report included an on-camera interview with Deputy Chief Tom Dolan, who said the officer, Ron Bellendier, didn't have permission to work for Taser. He said Bellendier was the department's chief Taser trainer and was responsible for monitoring Taser use within the department. He was also believed to have influence over recommending how many guns should be purchased by the department. In response to my questions, a police department spokeswoman sent a copy of Bellendier's employment history, which shows he resigned on Christmas Day, three days after the report aired. One week later, the 16-year Minneapolis police veteran was hired by Taser as a regional manager in charge of the Midwest. Bellendier's dual role in charge of Taser training for the Minneapolis police department and as a Taser ""master instructor,"" paid by Taser, is ""sure cozy -- uncomfortably so,"" John Gavin of SEC Insight wrote Monday in a report to clients detailing the WCCO report. Like many local TV reports, the WCCO piece was ignored by other media; Gavin, who lives in Minneapolis, only heard about it after mentioning Taser to someone who had seen it. In its last annual 10-K filed with the SEC, Taser said that it had certified more than 11,500 ""law enforcement training officers"" as Taser instructors. Of those, 263 are certified by Taser as ""master instructors"" who train ""other law enforcement and corrections agency trainers, not just end-users within these organizations."" The company says master instructors are paid for each session they conduct. ""These training sessions have led directly to the sale of Tasers to a number of police departments,"" according to the 10-K. Taser President Tom Smith told me the master instructors are paid a cash consulting fee and do their training when they're not on duty for their regular job -- much like police officer who moonlight as bouncers ""at a local nightclub."" Isn't it a conflict for an active police officer whose department uses Taser guns to also be employed by Taser? ""That's between the officer and that department,"" Smith says. A department spokeswoman says the investigation ended when Bellendier left the department because there can be no outcome for a non-employee. However, sources say the department is continuing to look deeper into whether Bellendier, who had a flexible schedule, did work for Taser while on the department's clock. A bigger question: In the law enforcement industry, was Bellendier the rule or the exception? Meanwhile, one of the knocks on Taser from Gradient Analytics was that the company recorded an unusually large sale to a distributor at the end of its fourth quarter. Such big end-of the-quarter shipments often suggests a company has stuffed its distribution channel by convincing customers to take more product than they really need to help boost revenues. Enter Tuesday's letter to shareholders: Taser said it may see ""delays"" in orders growth during the fist half of 2005 as customers ""test and evaluate potential new entrants."" Since when has competition ever been an issue? For what it's worth, stuffing also tends to steal sales from future quarters. Short Positions Pump and dump: Several weeks ago a self-proclaimed investment newsletter editor jumped on the Novastar NFI, +0.90% bandwagon with a lengthy report extolling the virtues of the subprime mortgage lender. A good portion of the report was spent trying to discredit yours truly, but the bottom line was that Novastar is a good investment. (Sounded like a recommendation, which was borne out by the fine print: The newsletter editor owns a small Novastar stake.) Then came his second report over the weekend, with more Greenberg grousing and the likelihood that Novastar's stock is likely to soar in the wake of a short squeeze prompted by Regulation SHO, a new government regulation designed to crack down on illegal so-called naked shorting. Then, at the bottom of the report, the newsletter editor repeats that he owns a small position in Novastar but then quickly added he is ""NOT recommending the issue."" So he owns it but doesn't recommend it. Talk about mixed messages! Speaking of Regulation SHO: In recent days there has been tremendous buzz over possible short squeezes of stocks that are on the NYSE and Nasdaq threshold lists. This is a list of stocks where there appears to be more stock that has been sold short than there are shares. The list includes Novastar, Taser and Krispy Kreme KKD Now there's a solid reason to own stocks. Works until it doesn't. Taser, which rose 12 percent in the final days of last year, is down more 53 percent from its year-end highs. Krispy Kreme is down 23 percent over the same period but considerably more from all-time highs. Their swift declines should serve as a reminder of what can happen, Regulation SHO or no Regulation SHO, if it turns out the performances of puffed-up companies aren't all they're cracked up to be.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Shares of two companies preparing to launch products to rival Taser International's electric ""stun guns"" rallied Friday, after Taser said the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission had launched an informal probe of its safety statements and sales to a distributor. Neither Taser rival trades on a major U.S. exchange. Bulletin Board-traded shares of Law Enforcement Associates LENF rallied as much as 52 percent before settling back to close at $7.72, up more than 34 percent. Volume was heavy at 4.6 million shares traded, about 16 times the stock's average full-day volume. Stinger Systems STIY which trades on the pink sheets and is therefore not subject to reporting requirements, rose 16 percent in volume of 358,000 shares traded, or about five times its average daily turnover. Taser, meanwhile, fell almost 18 percent to $22.72. Investors jarred Law Enforcement Associates and Stinger Systems surged after Taser disclosed the informal regulatory inquiry of its weapon, which is widely used by U.S. law-enforcement agencies and the military. Questions about the weapon's safety -- and studies used to support safety claims -- were raised last fall, when The New York Times reported that a U.S. Air Force laboratory study had concluded the weapons could be dangerous, and in November, after police in Florida used the device on children. Taser TASR had claimed tests showed the weapon was safe to use even against children. The company has consistently defended its weapon, which is designed to shoot a bolt of temporarily disabling electricity into a person to enable law-enforcement officials to subdue them. See full story. Law Enforcement Associates, based in Youngsville, N.C., is preparing to launch a rival less-lethal weapon in March, according to the company's president, Paul Feldman. Feldman said the new LEA gun has demonstrated greater capacities for distance and accuracy than Taser's gun. ""It will be significantly less expensive than other products, so it'll be really competitive,"" he said. LEA specializes in video and surveillance eq uipment for law-enforcement agencies and has annual sales of about $6 million. The company decided to expand into the less-lethal-weapon market after purchasing patents from James McNulty, former vice president of operations and engineering at Tasertron, acquired by Taser in 2002. Charlotte, N.C.-based Stinger Systems, which also purchased patents from McNulty, is preparing to release its own less-lethal weapon, called Stinger 4 Dart, in the next 30 days. Chief Executive Robert Gruder said early marketing has generated strong interest from the law-enforcement community. Morgan Keegan analyst Brian Ruttenbur is expecting the weapon to offer serious competition to Laser's stun gun, he said. The Stinger uses four darts, while the Taser weapon uses just two. ""When you shoot with the Taser, you have to have both probes go in to create the shock effect,"" Ruttenbur told CBS MarketWatch. ""With Stinger, you only need two of the four probes to go in -- and it's selling at $600 a unit against the $1,000 Taser charges for its gun."" Hear more from Ruttenbur. Addressing concerns CEO Gruder said the Stinger is also equipped with a video camera, with four-hour recording capability, for day or night use. ""It's very important for accountability with the police and also organizations like Amnesty International,"" he said. Amnesty has been critical of the findings of some of the safety studies carried out on Taser's weapons. The Stinger has attracted a great deal of criticism from one quarter: Taser International. In December, Taser filed a lawsuit against Stinger Systems, accusing it of false advertising and unlawful patent marking. Among the long list of allegations in the suit, Taser claims that Stinger Systems' new device is not even at the prototype stage and that videos on its Web site demonstrating its use are faked. Gruder rejected all the charges in a press release issued Tuesday. ""They're basically calling all the law-enforcement officers who've tested our gun a bunch of liars, which is incredible,"" he said. Stinger is planning to vigorously defend itself and is mulling a countersuit, he said. Stinger Systems was created in September with the acquisition of Electronic Defense Systems and its merger into a shell company, Gruder said. On Jan. 1, the company announced a $10 million private placement, with two institutional investors. Those investors received warrants for a further $7.5 million worth of stock. The CEO was unable to provide any details of the company's financials ahead of a filing with the SEC due next week.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) - U.S. stocks ended lower Friday as the market kicked off 2005 with a weekly loss on fears a solid December employment report and Federal Reserve concerns about inflation may lead to a pick-up in the pace of future interest rate hikes. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% ended down 18.92 points, at 10,603.96, notching up a weekly decline of 1.6 percent. Within the blue-chip benchmark, Alcoa Inc. AA, +1.22% climbed 1 percent as investors bought into the stock ahead of its fourth-quarter earnings report due out on Monday. Intel Corp. INTC, +5.00% scheduled to report quarterly results next Tuesday, gained 1.5 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index $COMPQ drifted lower into the close, to end down 1.39 points, at 2,088.61. The tech-rich index tumbled nearly 4 percent on the week. Strength in semiconductor SOX, +2.24% and Internet stocks $GIN helped put a floor underneath the Nasdaq. The S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38% dipped 1.70 points, to 1,186.19. The broad gauge fell 2.1 percent on the week. Historical trends offer investors little in the way of guidance as to the future behavior of a market which kicks off a year on a down note, as this one did. Of the 20 down First Five Days since 1950, 10 were followed by full-year gains and 10 by full-year losses, according to the Stock Trader's Almanac. And in six of the last 13 post-election years, full-year losses averaged 11.1 percent. Friday's employment report left investors pondering the pace and size of U.S. interest rate hikes. ""The problem is that we're getting job growth that is good, but not great,"" said Peter Boockvar, equity strategist at Miller Tabak. ""But it's good enough to continue inflation pressures building and the Fed still raising interest rates."" He added: ""There was some hope with the rally this morning that maybe we would bounce from the weakness this week, but the lack of any follow-through scared the bulls and brought out immediate selling."" Other market strategists took a more positive view of the employment data. ""Today's jobs report, when you look at all the moving parts, was pretty much in line with expectations, ""said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at Spencer Clarke. 'Should be supportive' ""If anything, it should be mildly supportive for the stock market because it takes some of the pressure off the [Federal Reserve] to raise rates aggressively over the next three to six months,"" Sheldon said. However, a combination of end-of-week profit taking and a little bit of uncertainty caused by the Fed's rising concern about inflation ""put a bit of a dampener on things,"" Sheldon added. U.S. nonfarm payrolls grew by a seasonally adjusted 157,000 in December, while the unemployment rate held steady at 5.4 percent, the Labor Department said. The average estimate of economists polled by CBS MarketWatch had been for a gain of 178,000 new jobs, but revisions to previous months put the December data near this mark. See full story. Bonds, dollar, gold, oil Meanwhile, benchmark U.S. Treasury notes ended little changed after the jobs data, which did little to alter expectations for a continued pace of modest rate increases engineered by the Fed, analysts said. The price of the 10-year Treasury note ended down 2/32 at 99 26/32. In the currencies market, the dollar reversed course against the euro and pared losses against the Japanese yen in mid-morning trading. The greenback's move higher was initiated in part by a repeat of a strong-dollar preference by U.S. Treasury Secretary John Snow and the triggering of sell orders that waited at the six-week euro-dollar lows reached earlier this week, traders said. See currency report Gold ended lower to log a one-week loss of over 4 percent with metals traders' assessment of the jobs report leaning toward the likelihood of near-term gains in the dollar. Strength in the greenback lowers the attractiveness of the precious metal as an investment. February gold closed at $419.50 an ounce, down $2.10 for the session, and down $18.90 for the week. In energy futures, the February crude-oil contract briefly topped $46 a barrel amid growing signs that key oil producers are prepared to stave off any steep prices declines by trimming output even further. Crude for February delivery ended down 13 cents at $45.43, but up almost $2 for the week. See full story.

Apple is expected to issue an update on its prospects for the quarter next Wednesday and has steered analysts toward earnings from 39 cents to 42 cents a share. ""Expectations are running high, as we think investors may be anticipating 4.5-5.0 million iPods and at least 50 cents earnings per share. Nevertheless, we expect consensus estimates for FY05 to take another step function upward, which should enable further appreciation,"" the broker told clients. Apple's shares soared 7.3 percent, climbing to $69.25. In other broker action, Morgan Stanley upgraded ratings on FedEx Corp. FDX, +2.26% and United Parcel Service UPS, +1.93% to ""overweight"" from ""equal weight,"" as the brokerage rebalanced its portfolio of transportation stocks.

Shares of Taser TASR which makes electric stun guns, closed down $4.90, or 17.7 percent, to $22.72, having earlier touched a low of $21.29. Almost 36 million shares changed hands, more than twice the company's average daily turnover. The inquiry was disclosed late Thursday by the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based maker of the devices, which are widely used by U.S. law enforcement and military agencies. Morgan Keegan Equity Research told clients in a note that it's concerned about the probe, although it's sticking with a ""market perform"" rating on the stock. ""We are certain that the company will share all safety studies that are currently available,"" said analyst Brian Ruttenbur. ""However, the available data has been determined, for example by Amnesty International, to be insufficient to make a conclusive decision on the product safety in all circumstances including children, (the) elderly, and individuals with specific health conditions."" Questions about the weapon's safety -- and studies used to support safety claims -- were raised last fall, when the New York Times reported that a U.S. Air Force laboratory study concluded the weapons could be dangerous, and in November, after police in Florida used the device on children. On Nov. 30, Amnesty International called for a nationwide ban on the use of Taser devices until more independent testing proved the safety of the weapons. The company's primary weapon is designed to deliver a bolt of temporarily disabling electricity into a person, allowing law enforcement officers or soldiers to subdue him. ""Our public statements about the safety of Taser devices are consistent with those of medical experts we have consulted, or in the case of the Department of Defense, were reviewed and approved prior to release by the very agencies that have commissioned the research,"" said Taser CEO Rick Smith in a press release. Taser has claimed tests showed the weapon was safe to use on children. Taser's expansion into a consumer version of its devices has also served to heighten safety concerns. The company said the SEC was looking into a recent order received from distributor Davidson's Inc. for 1,000 consumer stun guns. The order, which Taser said was for less than $1 million, was disclosed by the company on Dec. 20, just 11 days before the end of its fiscal fourth quarter. ""The Davidson order was entered into very late in the month, and Taser does make safety claims about its guns,"" said Source Capital Group analyst Joe Blankenship, ""but I doubt that anything negative will come from it."" Rivals ready for launch Adding to its challenges, the company will soon face increased competition from two new entrants, Stinger Systems STIY and Law Enforcement Associates LENF which are both preparing to introduce products. See full story. Morgan Keegan is expecting Stinger Systems' new four-dart, ""less-lethal weapon,"" which is gun-powder based, to offer competition to the Taser stun gun. ""We remain concerned that competition to Taser may rise in the first half of 2005 and potentially slow down Taser sales in the period,"" said Ruttenbur. The analyst is also skeptical that Taser can reach its own forecast of 100 percent revenue growth in the next several years. Ruttenbur forecasts growth of 30 to 40 percent. ""We maintain that we like the long-term prospects for Taser International and other conduct energy weapons but believe shares of Taser are fairly priced at current levels,"" he said. Taser's difficulties, however, were good news for its rivals' stocks. Stinger Systems shares advanced more than 16 percent to finish at $33.75, while Law Enforcement Associates added nearly 38 percent to $7.71.

AAXN,"Corrects chart data for Taser International. BOSTON (CBS.MW) -- In defining ""stupid"" for average investors, I sometimes personify the word, and show myself as ""lacking normal intelligence and reason."" Thankfully, that didn't happen often in 2004. While the most patently ridiculous investment scenarios have supporters -- most sending me nasty letters promising I'd rue the day I highlighted their favorite stock or fund -- there's no denying that 2004 witnessed an abundance of bad investment ideas, the kinds of things that look attractive on the surface but which prove that beauty is only skin deep. As such, it is with pleasure (rather than great discomfort) that I review the best and worst picks for Stupid Investment of the Week in 2004. Stupid Investment of the Week highlights the problems that make specific securities, plans or products less than ideal for the average investor, in the hope that spotlighting one bad issue will make others easier to find. The words ""average investor"" are crucial in deciding where and why I point the finger. Stock jockeys, day traders, investors with advanced technical timing models or an insider's knowledge are far from average, though they represent the bulk of people who send me hate mail. Savvy investors can make money using investments and strategies that don't work for the average guy. There also plenty of occasions when a pick falls into the category of ""good company, bad stock,"" which means that -- despite good promise and potential -- current conditions suggest the issue is in a dangerous place. Profits alone can't make an investment ""smart for the average consumer."" The ride a security provides is critical. Studies show that average investors tend to bail out when losses move into the 20 percent range, so a security that takes a dive after gaining some acclaim is a lousy choice, even if it rebounds to reach new highs. The average investor sees only the downturn, and is gone when the rebound comes. As the arbiter of stupid, there are many issues on which my feelings will never change. The ""Freedom Tower Silver Dollar"" (Read Sept. 24 column) would be a putrid investment even if the National Collectors Mint were not prohibited by court order from selling any more of them. Likewise, the ""burial expense plan"" from Physicians Life Insurance Co.(Read Feb. 27 column.) will never become a good idea, and the massive number of complaints piling up against the computer-financing deal from Blue Hippo Funding(Read Nov. 12 column) simply prove how bad that situation is. Half of the 15 individual stocks chosen for Stupid Investment of the Week will finish the year at least 25 percent below the price they were at when named a poor choice. The smallest, most speculative issues were the worst, with eDollars. (Read March 19 column), losing 97 percent of its value and Computerized Thermal Imaging (Read March 26 column) disappearing entirely. Another small issue, Maui General Stores(Read Aug. 20 column.) is off roughly 80 percent, but also represented one of my failings. Maui General was dragged into the ""vice mail"" scam, where fake ""wrong-number"" voice messages were left in the hope that investors would think they had been blessed with a hot insider tip. I needed to make the Maui pick sooner. I knew the company was in the soup, and the trading patterns showed it was moving because of the scam, but I held the story an extra week to make sure the minute details were correct. Several readers noted that if my column had moved sooner -- before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission notified the public of the fraud (the agency did not name the stocks involved), I would have saved them some heartache. They were reckless to follow the silly voice-mail tip, but my job is helping investors protect themselves and I failed to provide the earliest possible warning. One of the more controversial picks of the year was Taser International, which was Stupid Investment of the Week in early April (Read April 9 column.), about a week before it hit a peak and dropped into a pit that would shave about 50 percent off the price before a rebound. It took seven months to regain the high; while long-term holders have come out ahead on Taser, the average person buying near the peak probably would not have stuck around long enough to profit. The big miss among stocks this year was Tesoro Petroleum, (Read June 11 column.), which refines, markets and distributes oil and gas products. The company was coming off a 222 percent gain in 2003 and was up another 50 percent in 2004 when I wrote about it. I said the gains were not sustainable, particularly if oil prices started to fall. Well, oil prices declined, but TSO didn't; it's up another 40 percent since my column appeared, and while my premise of avoiding the hot name in a cyclical business has merit, I feel silly for reading the tea leaves so badly here. On the mutual fund side, ProFunds Ultra Wireless Investors(Read June 25 column.) was the leading fund at the year's halfway point, which put it on the outs with me. The fund still gets just a one-star rating from Morningstar and gets Lipper's worst grades for total return, consistent return and preservation of capital, but there is no denying that the market conditions that propelled it to the top did not dissipate as quickly as I expected. One bit of solace: last year, the midway leader was Apex Mid-Cap Growth(Read July 11, 2003 column.) and it, too, maintained performance long enough for me to eat some crow. This year, however, Apex Mid-Cap is back down near the bottom of the barrel. My call wasn't bad, so much as it was early, and I think the same will happen with ProFunds Ultra Wireless. Another bad call on funds came late in 2003, when I singled out the Vice Fund, a gimmick issue that buys ""sin stocks,"" and where top management was in some regulatory trouble. At least for 2004, the gimmick worked and the regulatory issues made no difference; the fund is up nearly 20 percent this year, putting it near the top of its asset category. I still hate the premise, but I can't deny I might have been too cynical about the fund's performance potential.

As such, investment newsletters, considered free of such entanglements, have drawn greater attention. In the ""it pays to read the small print"" department,"" it appears that some newsletters may not be so independent. Stock Prospector and Equities Special Situations are two such publications that freely admit in legal disclaimers to having received fees from companies that have been recommended in their newsletters. Eric Dany, who edits Stock Prospector and Mutual Fund Prospector, currently holds 27,500 shares of Turner Valley Oil & Gas TVOG, -9.74% in his Stock Prospector model portfolio. Dany began running this disclaimer in this year's April issue: ""Eric Dany received a payment of $20,000 in cash and additional subscription revenue for a publicly distributed special advertising issue of the Stock Prospector intended to create investor awareness of Turner Valley Oil and Gas and generate subscriptions to the Stock Prospector."" Dany initiated coverage of Turner Valley in November 2003, purchasing 17,500 shares for his model portfolio, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest. An additional 10,000 shares joined the portfolio toward the end of October when the stock was trading near its 52-week low. While Turner Valley's share price is still down roughly 45 percent from its price when Dany initiated coverage in 2003, it has rebounded sharply from the 52-week low. Give Dany credit, he's not shy about noting this stock's volatility, and maintains that this is an extremely speculative buy. The HFD began tracking Eric Dany's Stock Prospector at the beginning of 2000. Since that time, it's lost 5.9 percent annually through the end of November, vs. a 2.2 yearly loss for the Wilshire 5000 SVH, +5.63% Over the 13 months since Dany added Turner Valley to his portfolio, however, the Stock Prospector is off a cumulative 11 percent annually, vs. a 15.1 percent gain for the Wilshire. Similarly, Equities Special Situations has acknowledged a financial relationship with at least seven of its current 12 buy recommendations. Many of these relationships derive from a fee paid by these companies to do presentations at investment conferences hosted by parent publication Equities Magazine. From Equities Special Situations comes this caveat emptor: ""Readers should be aware that (this company) paid $7,500 to present its strategy at (one of our conferences). We have tried to be objective, but may have failed. You readers must decide for yourself."" Other relationships stem from companies purchasing 500 or 1000 copies of the issue of Equities Special Situations in which they were featured, presumably for promotional purposes. The newsletter always discloses the number of copies that each company purchased, as well as the price at which they were purchased. In addition, each issue of the newsletter includes the additional boilerplate disclaimer in even smaller print: ""Some companies written up may be advertisers in our sister publication, paid sponsors at one of our corporate conferences or may buy reprints. However, our buy, sell or hold decisions will never be based on such events but on what we believe is best for our readers."" The HFD has been tracking Equities Special Situations since the beginning of 1987. Equities Special Situations has returned 8.9 percent annualized through the end of November, vs. 11.5 percent annualized for the Wilshire 5000 over the same period. -- Ari Charney Subscribe: HFD Newsletter Performance Profiles More from MarketWatch What Picking Up an Apple Tells You About the Future of Robotics More Coverage Don’t ever do this with your credit card S&P 500 logs longest losing streak of the year as trade-war jitters weigh Delta flight scare is a reminder never to put electronics in checked baggage","Dec 21, 2004 3:20 p.m. ET",1,"Pfizer murmur, Leapfrog stumble and 2004’s top letters",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/pfizer-murmur-leapfrog-stumble-and-2004s-top-letters

CINCINNATI (CBS.MW) -- Tuesday's pre-market bias was higher following stronger-than-expected quarterly results from Morgan Stanley and Bear Stearns. Early buy interest follows a mixed session for U.S. stocks Monday. The Dow rose 11 points, the Nasdaq lost 7 points, and the S&P 500 edged higher by less than a point. This first chart above is an hourly chart of the S&P 500. It serves as a detailed view of the past two weeks. Since finding support two weeks ago at 1,174, the index has rallied as much as 31 points, or 2.6 percent, before consolidating its gains over the past two sessions. Yet also note that for two consecutive sessions, the S&P has found support almost precisely at 1,194. That 1,194 support closely matches the top of a former range, and the support point designated here last week at 1,195. The near-term story on the Dow mirrors that on the S&P. Since lifting two weeks ago from support around 10,425, the Dow has run as much as 314 points, or 3.0 percent. Yet while the Dow has consolidated its gains over the past several sessions, it has maintained a posture above near-term support around 10,640. That 10,640 support closely matches the top of a former range -- the Dec. 3 high came in at 10,643. On a near-term basis, the Nasdaq remains the weakest of the three major averages. Last week, the index topped out for all practical purposes almost precisely at 2,164. Recall that level also matched the Dec. 3 high. Since then, the Nasdaq has trended steadily lower, though it has observed the designated technical levels. On further weakness, the next obvious support point holds at the mid-November highs around 2,110 to 2,112. The Nasdaq's daily chart widens the view on its recent rally. Again, the recent pullback has done little to alter the longer-term uptrend. The Dow is arguably the best positioned index. After staging that sharp rally in early November, the Dow consolidated its gains for five to six weeks, before extending its gains last week. Again, Friday's support around 10,640 is a rough match with the breakout point from that previously tight trading range - the Dec. 3 high came in at 10,643. So from a technical standpoint, the Dow's price action is consistent with an ongoing longer-term uptrend. The daily view on the S&P 500 also remains bullish. Remember the S&P closed the previous week - two Friday's ago -- precisely on 1,188.00. That set the stage for last week's break to three-year highs. The bigger picture Over the past two months, the major averages have spiked to notable new highs. The Dow has cleared a nine-month downtrend, the S&P 500 has made three-year highs, and the Nasdaq has made three-year highs. And to get to those new highs, the markets have staged massive near-term rallies. From the October lows -- where the Dow touched its 2004 low -- each index has carved out the following two-month return: The Dow Industrials has rallied 1,031 points, or 10.6 percent. The S&P 500 has gained 118 points, or 10.8 percent. The Nasdaq has added 272 points, or 13.8 percent. So on the one hand, the markets have staged these massive near-term rallies, making it difficult to be aggressively bullish. Still, it's worth placing longer-term perspective on this rally. Taking the S&P 500 and using January 4, 2002 as a reference point -- almost three years ago -- the S&P 500 at Monday's close was all of 18 points, or 1.5 percent, higher. That means the index has turned in a minuscule three-year return of just 1.5 percent. Yet taking this comparison one step further, note the S&P topped out on January 4, 2002 at 1,176. That's almost an exact match with the recent lift from support, illustrated on the S&P's hourly chart above, at 1,174. So in essence, this recent one-week lift from 1,174 almost precisely matches the net gain on the S&P 500 over the past three years. Again, the frame of reference is the important issue. While the markets are indeed extended near-term -- making it tough to add aggressively following this two-month run of 10 percent -- on a longer-term basis, they're anything but extended at current levels. Tuesday's watch list The charts below identify several names worth watching from a technical perspective. These are intended as radar screen names - sectors or stocks that appear well positioned for a potential move in the specified direction over the near term. For the original comments on the stocks below, check out The Technical Indicator Library. Index Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Gold & Silver Index XAU 98.76 96.0 100 Over the past three weeks, the Gold & Silver Index has broken decisively lower, and even at current levels, isn't exactly attracting buyers. Note that last week the XAU violated the 100 level and has since observed that area as resistance. The group's outlook now favors further downside until it at least reasserts a stance back above its 50-day moving average. Yet the real point illustrated above isn't so much the adverse outlook for gold as it is the bullish near-term outlook for the U.S. dollar. As a very general rule, when interest rates rise it attracts foreign investors to buy U.S. bonds. That requires them to purchase U.S. dollars, which in turn increases the value of the dollar. When the U.S. dollar goes up, gold goes down. Also note that strength in the U.S. dollar dilutes the drop in crude oil prices, making the recent slump in crude more sustainable. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Taser International TASR $28.34 $26.75 $29.00 Stun gun maker Taser International TASR is well positioned technically to rise. In early November, it broke higher on strong volume confirming its longer-term uptrend. Since then, it has consolidated on lighter volume, finding support almost exactly at the breakout point around the July and September highs. Monday, it challenged one-month highs on strong volume, suggesting it may be positioned to resume its longer-term uptrend. The bullish near-term outlook would be placed in question on a close under its one-week low around $26.75. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Nanophase Technologies NANX $7.92 $7.50 $8.40 Nanophase Technologies NANX, -0.22% is another name positioned to rise. Last week, it broke decisively above its 200-day moving average, making five-month highs in the process. Since then, it has maintained those highs behind a sustained increase in volume. That means despite its recent extension, there are still buyers at prevailing levels. Its bullish near-term outlook should remain intact barring a close under very recent support at $7.50. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance InterActiveCorp IACI $25.88 $23.70 $26.85 Profiled in The Technical Indicator on Dec. 10, InterActiveCorp IACI, +0.00% remains technically well positioned. It will open higher Tuesday after the company announced plans to spin off Expedia as a separate public entity. The rally should place InterActiveCorp above its 200-day moving average, currently at $26.85. That 200-day moving average sets the longer-term trend, and assuming it can sustain Tuesday's breakout, the longer-term term outlook will be higher. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Qwest Communications Q $4.23 $4.00 $4.30 Qwest Communications Q, +0.00% is another name positioned to rise. Since breaking out in early December, it has consolidated its gains on lighter volume, finding support around the breakout point of $4.00. Also note the bullish 50-day/200-day moving average crossover signals the intermediate-term uptrend has overtaken the longer-term trend. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Wright Medical Group WMGI $29.65 $28.30 $30.22 Initially profiled Dec. 9, Wright Medical Group WMGI, +1.33% remains technically well positioned. Recall its initial rally occurred on strong volume, after the company reaffirmed its fourth quarter outlook. Yet from a technical standpoint, that early December rally also resolved a bullish inverse head-and-shoulders pattern. The left shoulder is defined by the August low, the head by the October low, and the right shoulder by the November low. The neckline is defined by the September high at $28.34 and the November high of $28.30. Its bullish near-term outlook should be intact barring a close back under that neckline. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Infosys Technologies INFY $71.58 $65.30 New High Profiled Nov. 30, Infosys Technologies INFY, +0.90% has since edged two points higher, and remains well positioned. Last week, it rallied on above average volume, after recently finding support just above its 50-day moving average. Then Monday, Infosys edged to four-year highs, also on increased volume. From current levels, initial support around $65.30 approximates the December low. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance RadiSys RSYS $17.60 $16.80 $18.60 RadiSys RSYS, -0.76% is another name positioned to rise. In early December, it spiked above its 200-day moving average on strong volume. Since then, it has consolidated its gains, favoring the high end of its range on lighter relative volume. Also note the early December rally resolved a four-month ascending triangle, a bullish formation suggesting the shares are attracting buyers at progressively higher prices. Still well positioned The table below includes selected names recently profiled in The Technical Indicator that remain well positioned.

AAXN,"SAN DIEGO (CBS.MW) -- So many stories, so little time. Gas pains: With Cheniere Energy's stock trading below $50 briefly last Thursday, I wondered whether investors who bought 5 million shares of the company's stock the night before at $60 would want their money back. It seemed like an appropriate question, considering that in the same press release announcing the deal's pricing Cheniere also announced that ChevronTexaco had decided not to invest in the company's Sabine Pass liquid gas project. Fast forward to Monday: After the market's close Cheniere LNG, +2.20% announced it had signed a long-awaited, 20-year deal with ChevronTexaco CVX, +1.73% to provide Cheniere with 700 million cubic feet per day of liquefied natural gas at Sabine Pass. (In English: This is gas that Cheniere will take in liquid from ChevronTexaco, convert to gaseous gas, and then return to ChevronTexaco.) As a result, investors who held their stock were back in the money based on after-market trading. And according to fans, those who bought are likely to be richly rewarded down the road -- assuming everything goes the way they're hoping. If the stock's so attractive, why would Chevron back out of its investment? Cheniere hasn't said -- and the company never returned my call from last week. But those who talk to Cheniere say word from inside is that ChevronTexaco actually wanted a bigger piece of the project and Cheniere didn't want to risk losing commercial control to a minority investor. Besides, with $300 million from the stock offering, Cheniere no longer needed ChevronTexaco's cash. Still, the announcement of negotiations with ChevronTexaco allowed investors to extrapolate a value of $80 per share for all of Cheniere. Bulls believe that value should increase at 15 percent a year as Cheniere gets closer to generating cash flow from its three key projects, including Sabine, which should all be on line within the next five years. (No wonder the nasty-grams were flowing in on this one, even though all I really did was point out what had happened -- and how bizarre it all was.) Speaking of nasty-grams: The Hostile React-O-Meter was spinning outta control, outta control, I tell ya, after my Friday night column on OmniVision OVTI, +1.49% which makes image-sensor chips used in cell phones. We're talking religious slurs and everything in between. Pretty par for the course. (Never ceases to amaze me how many people are reading this column for the first time -- and some, I'm sure, the last!-- even after nearly 17 years and three employers.) The column in question merely pointed out what the company itself disclosed in its 10-Q: That it's the focus of an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission. But emotions run high among investors, and that's understandable. The company itself issued a press release Monday regarding the inquiry, saying absolutely nothing. (Actually, to paraphrase, it said it can't comment beyond what it has already disclosed.) Meanwhile, OmniVision also disclose in the quarterly filing that the company's gross margin had been inflated by $3.5 million by the sale of products for which reserves had been taken. That's another way of saying the company sold chips that it previously wrote off. Why would a company sell previously written off products in an increasingly competitive industry in which products are becoming rapidly obsolete? Shouldn't they be turned into sand? Good question, and it's one I would've asked CFO Peter Leigh had he returned my call. On Dec. 2 I reported that he said gross margins were higher, in part, because a smaller reserve was taken, in turn leading to a lower cost of goods. That's what happens, I guess, if you sell inventory that no longer has any cost. That's also one way of not having to having to reverse a reserve. Moving on... Over-the-top on Overstock.com: An analyst from Lehman Brothers, which was the lead investment banker on Overstock's OSTK, -0.96% recent stock offering, initiated coverage on the retailer with a target price of $90. But reading the report is yet another throwback to 1999. The analyst explains there's really no good way to value the company other than using the discounted cash flow method, which uses projections of revenue and EBITDA growth out to 2009. (As if that's really possible, but I digress...) If you didn't know better you'd think you were reading a report by Goldman Sachs from April 2000 on the brilliant potential B2B e-Commerce star Internet Capital Group, then $90 a share -- now $9 a share. Video volley: Investors ignored news last week that according to retail data, Take-Two's TTWO, +0.33% latest version of Grand Theft Auto didn't sell as many copies in November as had been expected. More not-so-great news: Electronic Arts ERTS Monday announced it had signed an exclusive video game licensing deal with the NFL. To quote my pal Jeff Macke, who writes for Minyanville.com: ""Take-Two is once again, effectively, a one horse show... No financials were announced, but no matter what ERTS paid, the deal looks like a Joe-Theisman's-leg type of blow to Take-Two."" Take-Two, of course, is like a cat when it comes to lives, so time will tell whether it lands on its feet this time. Finally -- Doughnut holes: Krispy Kreme's KKD third-quarter 10-Q was delayed as the company tried to work through some accounting issues related to a franchisee... Blast from the past: In my recent ""Have investors learned nothing?"" column I mentioned a company in Ohio that issued a press release years ago denouncing a story that was about to appear in Business Week. (I used it as a reference point in mentioning Taser TASR which did something similar a week ago regarding an upcoming Miami Herald story.) I forgot the name. It's Cincinnati Microwave, which ran into financial problems. Its stock -- or what's left of it -- trades on the pink sheets...

AAXN,"SAN DIEGO (CBS.MW) -- There was a lesson I learned long ago. It was in the mid-1990s. I would write almost daily in my column, which then appeared on the front page of the San Francisco Chronicle, about a now-defunct company called Media Vision. At the time, it was one of the hottest in Silicon Valley. I've told this story here in one form or another several times in the past. But it warrants telling yet again today with the way stocks like Travelzoo TZOO, +1.75% Overstock.com OSTK, -0.96% Taser TASR and even OmniVision OVTI, +1.49% have been acting. After its stock had jumped 22 percent in the wake of my latest critical stab at the company, Media Vision's then-CEO, Paul Jain, called me and crowed, ""That confirms that this is a high-quality story."" It was that comment that made me realize just how often the movement of stocks is totally unrelated to the business. Rising stocks often mean nothing more than, well, stocks are rising. Jain, whose company was the focus of short sellers, took it one step further in the same story when he said, ""The shorts have to understand that they'll be burned by me."" They were -- until several months later, when the company reported a big disappointment, causing Media Vision's stock to crater. Several years later, Jain went to prison after it was discovered the company was booking revenue on products when the parts for some of those very products counted as sold were still on a slow boat from China. (I'm not kidding.) It's a story that often resonates in my head, and it's one reason that today, more than 10 years later, I still take what many CEOs say with little more than a grain of salt -- especially those who are keen on bragging about how well they're doing and talk along the lines of how they're going to ""burn"" the shorts and critics. Don't get me wrong: There are some plenty of really good CEOs out there who go about their business and live or die by their numbers -- not their stock prices. If the numbers bear out, the stock prices go higher. It's human nature to want stocks to rise, but too often they rise merely because of nothing more than unsustainable momentum. Unfortunately, that momentum lulls investors and even company executives into thinking they're smart, when they're really just parading around the chairs while the music is playing. That's why, when I used to work at TheStreet.com TSCM I would often write that it was important to read Jim Cramer because he would tell you what was going on at the ""lunatic fringe"" of the market. There's nobody who understands that world better than Jim, who just last week wrote of Taser and another company: ""They have made fortunes for people, no mean task, and they have enough hope to do it again. I salute them and their ilk rather than thumb my nose at them. That's for old-timers who have forgotten that the process is not an academic one; it is one about making money."" Damn the fundamentals. But Jim's right, and that fringe started having a big influence on the market in direct correlation to the growth of the Internet and popularity of business TV, both of which helped speed the flow of information. But it's all really a game, and in the end, as we all know -- and as companies like Krispy Kreme KKD and Netflix NFLX, +3.35% remind us -- it works until it doesn't. You can justify all kinds of valuations using all kinds of wacky metrics as long as stocks are going higher. It's funny how some of those methods of valuation look so silly after the fact. Is it different this time? No -- just as it wasn't during the bubble. When the music stops you still need to find a chair. It's remarkable so many investors still haven't learned that lesson. What's happening, after all, is so 1999. Except that instead of Amazon, we have Overstock. Meanwhile, back on OmniVision: Quite of bit of reader response to last week's item here on the maker of camera chips, which are better known as image sensors. It was enough to get the Hostile React-o-Meter spinning, but by no means out of control. Many of the responses were along the lines that one reason investors have been bidding up OmniVision's stock is because it's cheap on a cash flow basis. (Since when are chip companies valued their cash flow? Ah, that's right, as I mentioned earlier, you use whatever metrics work. Besides, as we all know, cash flow isn't always what it appears.) Others pointed to the company's cash generation last quarter, which on the surface looks impressive. But cash generation can always look good if you defer payments to suppliers or engage in other maneuverings. Notice that ""other"" current liabilities rose by $16 million. (You have to wonder what the ""other"" means.) Meanwhile, there were readers who said I should be careful about questioning OmniVision, because it's the leader in its industry. Well, I realize that, but in tech, especially chips, today's leader is likely to be tomorrow's laggard. Success in technology breeds competition, which for OmniVision is coming from the likes of Micron Technology MU, +1.26% Micron made that clear at a recent investment conference. ""The major players in that market today is OmniVision, who is, I think, generally considered to be the No. 1 player in the mobile space,"" Micron investor relations chief Kip Bedard said. ""We have moved into what we think is probably No. 2, and we're probably about a 25 percent market share player there. There's about 32 different CMOS image sensor companies. The ones that tend to get mentioned next are ST Micro STM, +0.63% and Agilent A, +0.75% The ones that I think are coming on the horizon you have to keep your eye on would be Toshiba TOSBF, -1.49% Samsung SSNGY, +0.00% and probably even Sony SNE, +0.54% here at some point. So I think the landscape probably changes pretty dramatically over the next couple of years."" If not sooner. Taser Talk: Over the weekend Taser issued a press release damning a Miami Herald story before it was published. No idea how Taser knew what the Herald would write, but it reminds me of an Ohio smoke alarm company that did a similar thing years ago after being interviewed by Business Week. I forget the name of the company, because it no longer exists. Finally, sly as a fox: Was on Fox News Channel's Cavuto on Business over the weekend going head-to-head with Neil Cavuto. (Don't even ask where I got the tie.) He was wondering why the media is always so negative regarding positive economic news. Neil is without a doubt the best of the bunch among business commentators -- even if you don't always agree with his politics or his angle. On this topic not only did I disagree, I told him that if anything, the press isn't negative enough. And can you believe it? He called me a perma-bear! (Who, me?) Neil also wondered how anybody can be so glass-half-empty when they live in San Diego. Well, I muttered something like, ""It's been cold here lately."" (By the way, I'm not a perma-bear but a perma-skeptic -- big difference.) For more information or to subscribe to Herb Greenberg's RealityCheck, click here.

AAXN,"Editor's note: Corrects typographical error in first paragraph. SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Taser International and researchers are debating safety of the company's stun guns for use on children after Miami police zapped two children last month, according to a published report Sunday. The company said its products are safe to use on children and the outcry unwarranted, according to a story Sunday on the Miami Herald's Web site. But researchers, doctors and Underwriters Laboratories, a nonprofit organization that provides product-safety testing and certification, have raised questions about the gun and have called for more study of their safety, particularly on the young, the Herald reported. Taser TASR claims its weapons deliver a shock within a safe range for children as young as 2 years old. But, a researcher at UL told the Herald that tests on the stun guns were not designed with children in mind. ""I don't know that I had ever envisioned the use of this thing on small children,"" Wayne McDaniel, a University of Missouri-Columbia electrical engineer in charge of the Taser studies, told the Herald. ""I don't think anyone has ever tried to draw any inferences as far as use in children...The design of this device is for bad guys."" The debate over the products' safety on children began last month after police in Miami-Dade County, Fla. used the stun guns to subdue a 6-year-old boy and a 12-year-old girl. The report also says that Taser products haven't been tested by UL, despite indications in Taser-company literature that suggest otherwise. Taser said in a statement Saturday that the Herald report ""mischaracterizes"" the basis for its safety claims. Taser's statement comes within weeks of a New York Times article about unpublished results of U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory tests. The article said the stun guns could be dangerous and that more tests were needed to evaluate risks. See full story. Taser, based in Scottsdale, Ariz., said Saturday that its confidence in its technology is based on ""a body of overwhelming evidence that Tasers are generally safe and effective -- not on any one guideline or standard."" Taser said it has published safety charts that compare its stun guns' output to standards published by Underwriters Laboratories, a nonprofit organization that provides product-safety testing and certification. ""Much of the early development of Taser devices utilized electrical safety standards published by Underwriter Laboratories and other agencies,"" said Steve Tuttle, Taser's vice president of communications, in a statement. ""Taser International has never claimed that UL has tested or approved Taser devices, although we invite and welcome them to test our products."" Taser said one safety chart in question was developed by government research contractor Jaycor Inc., now a unit of Titan Corp. TTN from funding by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and the National Institute of Justice. The company said the study shows that Tasers have a ""significant margin"" of safety compared to published standards. On its Web site, Taser has links to studies, including a UL report on electrified fences that could deliver shocks to humans. It also links to the Jaycor study that mentions UL standards for the threshold of electrically injuring people. The company also cited recent independent reports from the Canadian government, the U.S. Department and Defense and the United Kingdom, which it said indicated that the devices are among the lowest-risk alternatives available to law enforcement agencies. The company said the results of additional testing on its devices will be published in a medical journal in January 2005, but did not name the journal. Amnesty International last month added its voice to a growing number of complaints about stun guns, saying more than 70 people have died during the past three years in the United States and Canada after they were jolted by the guns. Taser defended itself against the claims on Nov. 30, sending shares about 9 percent higher that day. See full story. Taser shares rose 47 cents Friday to $28.22.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- U.S. stocks ended lower Tuesday, but posted their best monthly gain for the year after a hitch-free presidential election sparked a broad-based rally in the market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average $INDU ended down 47.88 points, at 10,428.02. The benchmark index climbed 4 percent in November, but is still posting a loss on the year. Among the notable movers on the Dow, Wal-Mart WMT fell 2 percent and Home Depot HD dropped 2.8 percent on fears holiday sales may not live up to expectations. Intel INTC tumbled nearly 3 percent on investor jitters ahead of its midquarter trading update on Thursday. In a note to clients, Merrill Lynch said the chipmaker will likely stick with the midpoint of its previous financial targets. Pfizer Inc PFE was the biggest percentage gainer on the Dow, rising 1.6 percent after reiterating its 2004 earnings outlook, and offering a 2005 forecast within the current range of analyst estimates. The Nasdaq Composite Index $COMPQ fell 10.06 points, to 2,096.81. The tech-rich index soared 6.2 percent on the month. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 Index $SPX fell 4.75 points, to 1,173.82, with the broad gauge putting in a 3.9 percent gain on the month. List of concerns weigh on sentiment Tuesday's action saw investors grappling with a series of conflicting economic reports, prompting investors to consolidate some of those gains made over the last month. A retreat in oil prices offered some comfort, but the weakness of the dollar raised fears the Federal Reserve may have to raise interest rates to contain inflation and keep dollar-denominated assets attractive to foreign investors. ""The market is taking a little breather here while it digests a lot of this information, but it's not falling out of bed,"" said Edgar Peters, chief investment officer at Pan Agora. ""I think it will come back again."" Peters minimized the importance of an unexpected drop in the Conference Board's closely watched consumer confidence report. ""Consumer confidence falling is probably tied to higher energy prices and it's not completely clear that is going to result in lower Christmas sales."" The Conference Board reported U.S. consumers became more cautious in November. Its consumer confidence index fell to 90.5 points in November from a revised 92.9 in October. Economists had forecast the confidence index to rise to 95.7 in November Over at Miller Tabak, equity strategist Peter Boockvar was somewhat more cautious. ""It's worrisome in the context of a holiday season. This is the wrong time of the year to see faltering consumer confidence."" On the current weakness in bonds, Peters of Pan Agora said it could be seen as a positive factor for stocks. ""Part of the rise in bond prices may be due to the fact that people are going to be selling their bonds and buying some stocks with them in the coming days,"" said Peters. Bonds came off lows as the mixed bag of economic reports lowered the odds of a pickup in the scope and size of future interest rate increases. The benchmark 10-year note ended down 9/32 at 99 4/32. Its yield rose to 4.36 percent from 4.32 percent Monday. See full story. Elsewhere, retailers were dealt a double blow as the weaker-than-expected consumer confidence reading followed on the heels of a survey appearing to point to a softer-than-expected start to the holiday shopping season. Citing consumers holding out for bargains and a drop-off in Saturday's customer traffic, U.S. retail chains' same-store sales fell 1.5 percent in the week ended Nov. 27 compared with the previous week, according to data from the International Council of Shopping Centers compiled with UBS. The S&P Retail Index $RLX which tracks the sector, fell nearly 2 percent. However, solid consumer spending was one factor in this morning's upward revision to U.S gross domestic product growth for the third quarter. The economy grew at a 3.9 percent annual rate in the quarter, slightly faster than the 3.7 percent estimated a month ago, the Commerce Department reported. The figure was in line with economist expectations. The Commerce Department said higher exports, business investments and consumer spending drove the revision. See full story. On a more upbeat note, business activity expanded more than expected in the Chicago region this month. The Chicago Purchasing Managers Index stood at 65.2 percent compared to forecasts for 62.8 percent. Readings over 50 percent denote expansion. Growth did cool somewhat from a 17-year high 68.5 percent in October. See full story. The report helped stocks bounce off lows sparked by disappointing consumer confidence data. See full story. Oil, dollar, gold Crude-oil futures fell back under $50 a barrel in nervous trading ahead of this week's updates on U.S. petroleum supplies. Nervous traders -- ""running around like chickens with their heads cut off"" -- are trying to decide which direction to go ahead of the U.S. inventory numbers due out Wednesday, according to Kevin Kerr, president of Kerr Trading International. Earlier, oil climbed to an intraday high of $50.40 after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries indicated it will ""either lower production quotas or vow to roll back production to current quotas,"" said Phil Flynn, a senior analyst at Alaron Trading. ""It appears the falling dollar has OPEC wanting the price of oil to go higher as compensation,"" he said. OPEC is set to meet on Dec. 10 in Cairo. The benchmark January contract ended at a one-week low, down 63 cents at $49.13 a barrel, and down 4.9 percent on the month. See full story. High energy prices are taking their toll on economic growth, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The OECD lowered its 2005 economic growth forecasts for the U.S, Japan and the eurozone, saying the surge in oil prices has ""depressed real incomes as well as confidence in the OECD countries."" Read more The dollar hit a record low against the euro after the weaker-than-expected consumer confidence data. The dollar was down 0.1 percent with 1 euro at $1.3255, but was at $1.3335 in intraday trading. The buck recovered from early weakness against the yen, to trade up 0.2 percent, at 103.08. December gold fell $2.40 to close at $451.30 an ounce in New York, and February gold lost $2.60 to end at $453.20. But prices for the contracts still logged gains of around $22 for the month amid weakness in the U.S. dollar. Turning back to the broader market for equities, decliners outpaced advancers 19 to 13 on the New York Stock Exchange, and by a 17 to 14 count on the Nasdaq. Volume was 1.5 billion on the Big Board, and 1.8 billion on the Nasdaq. Stocks in focus Shares of Taser International Inc. TASR jumped as much as 9 percent after the company refuted criticism from human rights group Amnesty International that its stun gun is unsafe. Amnesty International said the company should suspend the sale of the gun, which it says has killed more than 70 people over the past three years. As its name implies, the gun is only supposed to stun an assailant. But Taser said several independent reviews have confirmed the gun has one of the safest use-of-force options open to the police. The company's stock was also getting a boost on the first day of trading after a 2-for-1 stock split. See full story. Meat processor Smithfield Foods SFD posted in-line second-quarter profit as sales jumped 32 percent from the same period a year ago. The company said its solid quarterly performance was the result of a 36 percent jump in live hog market prices, strong results from its turkey operations and a better performance from its international processing business. Shares in Smithfield Foods rose 4.1 percent to $29.05.

AAXN,"WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) - Shares of Taser International Inc. rose Tuesday as the company issued a sharp response to criticism from human rights group Amnesty International. The stock TASR gained almost 9 percent to $27.73. It was the first day of trading after a 2-for-1 stock split, originally announced Nov. 4. The split was Taser's third of the year. Amnesty International questions the growing use of the company's stun gun technology by law enforcement officers. The group said more than 70 people have died during the past three years in the U.S. and Canada after being jolted by the devices. The comments are the latest in what's been a growing chorus of criticism of stun guns. Taser, of Scottsdale, Ariz., defended its technology as non-lethal, saying Amnesty ""refuses to accept independent and comprehensive reports"" on the safety of the devises. Though promoted as a safer alternative for subduing people considered dangerous, Tasers are routinely used against people who don't pose a serious threat, Amnesty International said. ""They are frequently used in situations where use of firearms, or even batons, would never be justified."" Amnesty said its analysis indicates ""most of those who died were unarmed men who, while displaying disturbed or combative behavior, did not appear to present a serious threat to themselves or to the lives and safety of others."" In some cases, the use of Tasers ""has amounted to torture or cruel, inhuman and degradating treatment,"" Amnesty International said. It has requested that Taser use be suspended pending an independent inquiry into the effects, and that all officers be trained to use them only as a last resort. In response, Taser said Amnesty International is ""out of step with law enforcement worldwide."" ""Amnesty has repeatedly called for independent testing while ignoring the mounting independent, comprehensive reports showing Taser technology is safe and effective,"" said CEO Rick Smith. Citing several independent reviews conducted recently in the U.S. and the U.K., Smith said they ""clearly indicate that the Taser technology, while not risk-free, is among the safest use-of-force options our law-enforcement officers have.""

AAXN,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- U.S. stocks are likely to struggle to make gains early this week as investors wait to take their cue from a midquarter update by chip-making titan Intel Corp. on Thursday and the November jobs data due on Friday. Investors, who have watched equity markets rally by about 8 percent over the last month, were also likely to be concerned by high energy prices and a weakening dollar, strategists said. ""It will come down to the payroll number,"" said Peter Boockvar, an equity strategist at Miller Tabak. ""A good number started this rally and we'll see if there is any follow-through."" October's jobs data, released early this month, showed the U.S. economy added 337,000 jobs last month, many more than expected. The big increase in payrolls followed months of disappointingly low job gains and investors will be looking to see whether October was a fluke or the start of a period of sustained growth. Analysts polled by CBS MarketWatch expect, on average, that the jobs report will show payrolls swelled by 201,000 in November. Analysts expect the unemployment rate will drop to 5.4 percent from 5.5 percent. Intel's INTC, +5.00% report was another factor likely to draw scrutiny for indications of how technology spending may develop for the rest of the year. The prospects for Intel, one of the most important tech bellwethers, helps set the tone for investors across the technology sector. The semiconductor sector has been struggling with sluggish demand, rising inventories and pressure on profit margins for months, and investors appear to have low expectations for Intel's report, said Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist for Spencer Clarke. ""Going into the midquarter update, the bar has been set on the low side and investors aren't expecting a lot of good news,"" Sheldon said. ""So if Intel were to say positive things about demand, margins and inventories, that could boost sentiment."" Paul Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist for Windham Financial Services, said he agreed. ""A lot of investors, large institutional investors, are sitting out there with at least a market weight in that sector, so you need some good news to push to the next stage of the rally,"" he said. On Friday, the major U.S. equity averages finished mixed with Wall Street trading desks sparsely manned for the shortened session after the Thanksgiving holiday. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has risen 5.3 percent since the start of the month, ended Friday at 10,522.23, a gain of almost 2 points for the day; for the week, the blue-chip gauge added 0.6 percent.. The Nasdaq Composite Index ended less than a point lower at 2,101.97 on Friday, but putting it up 1.5 percent on the week. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index, which has risen 4.4 percent since the start of the month, closed up slightly at 1,182.65 on Friday, a rise of more than 12 points and 1 percent for the week. With the third-quarter earnings season mostly on the books, profit growth is likely to come in at about 17 percent, according to data from Thomson First Call. Thomson said 488 of the S&P 500's companies have reported and that 62 percent have posted results above analyst expectations, 16 percent in line and 22 percent below forecasts, a typical quarter. Earnings preannouncement season has yet to start in earnest but First Call data show the negative-to-positive preannouncement ratio at 1.8 percent, above the 1.6 ratio at the point of the previous quarter but below the long-term 2.0 average. Data currently suggest a fourth-quarter earnings growth rate of 15 percent, Thomson First Call data show. Dollar, oil in focus Other than economic data and Intel's report, investors will be preoccupied with the level of the dollar and the price of oil, strategists said. The dollar has been trading near all-time lows against the euro and the yen, which helps corporate profits in the short term and can lift the stock market, but also imports inflation and can undermine the economy in the longer term, they said. While many expect the dollar to continue to drop in the near term, they said the manner of its decline could turn out to be important. ""The major question is whether the dollar decline will be orderly or whether it will turn into a rout,"" Sheldon said. ""If the decline is orderly, that could be positive for equities, but if it turns into a rout, it could be a major destabilizing effect for U.S. markets."" Oil meanwhile stayed under $50 a barrel in the past week, and strategists said continued moderation would help the markets move higher. A slew of data Other than payrolls, investors this week will have to contend with several important economic reports, which will be closely watched for clues about economic performance as the year nears its end. ""Next week we really get all of November's economic data and that is really going to set the tone of the market,"" Mendelsohn said. On Tuesday, investors will get a second reading of third-quarter gross domestic product, which analysts expect to be revised up slightly to 3.8 percent from the 3.7 percent earlier reading. Tuesday also brings the November Chicago Purchasing Management index, which is expected to have dropped to 62.4 percent from 68.5 percent in October. On Wednesday, the Institute of Supply Management will release its index for November, which is expected to have fallen to 56.5 percent from 56.8 percent. Data on October personal income and consumer spending is also due on Wednesday, with analysts forecasting a 0.5 percent rise in income after September's 0.2 percent gain. Spending for the month is expected to have risen by 0.4 percent after a 0.6 percent rise in September. Wednesday also brings data on October construction spending, which is expected to have risen by 0.7 percent after staying flat in September. Vehicle sales data is also due Wednesday. Thursday brings a government report on factory orders for October, which are expected to have risen by 0.4 percent after September's 0.4 percent decline. See Economic Preview. A trickle of earnings Only four S&P 500 companies are scheduled to report their earnings this week. On Wednesday Comverse Technology CMVT is expected to report a third-quarter profit of 7 cents per share on sales of $239 million, according to analysts polled by Thomson First Call. Retailer Dollar General DG, +0.66% also reporting on Wednesday, is expected to post a third-quarter profit of 25 cents per share on revenue of $1.88 billion. On Thursday food and drug retailer Albertson's Inc ABS, +1.81% is expected to post earnings of 33 cents per share on sales of $10.13 billion. Pall Corp. PLL, -6.21% which makes industrial filters, is expected to report a fiscal first-quarter profit of 21 cents per share on revenue of $399 million. Friday's trading The major U.S. stock indexes finished the Friday session not far from where they started, with the lackluster benchmark moves belying strength in the broader market. ""It's the small-cap stocks that are doing well. The big capitalization issues, which are really the darlings of the institutions, are a bit sluggish here,"" said Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. ""I think the institutional players are completely absent; it's really retail demand here."" Wall Street trading desks were sparsely manned in the post-holiday, abbreviated trading session that ended at 1 p.m. Eastern time. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.07% finished the day up 1.92 points at 10,522.23. The Nasdaq Composite Index $COMPQ slipped 0.57 point to 2,101.97. The S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38% added 0.89 point, or 0.1 percent, to 1,182.65. Breadth was positive Friday, with Big Board winners outnumbering losers by a margin of nine to six, while on the Nasdaq advancers led decliners by 17 to 12. Underscoring the thin trading tone, volume was a paltry 501 million shares on the New York Stock Exchange and 668 million on the Nasdaq. Intel INTC, +5.00% down 1.7 percent, was the biggest decliner on the Dow, after the Semiconductor Industry Association said consumer electronics sales in the fourth quarter are expected to be about even with those of this year's third quarter, as high energy prices are holding back discretionary spending. Alcoa AA, +1.22% Altria Group MO, -0.21% Merck MRK, -1.13% and Pfizer PFE, +0.54% led blue-chip advancers. Also Friday, the dollar continued to fall to record levels vs. the euro, reaching as low as $1.3328 in overnight trading. Weighing on the greenback were reports that China's central bank had cut its U.S. Treasury holdings, due to concerns over the eroding value of the dollar. The dollar pared its pullback to 0.2 percent against the euro, changing hands at $1.3289, after a member of the monetary policy committee under the Chinese central bank said his remarks at a Shanghai seminar had been misinterpreted in a local newspaper article, a Xinhua Financial Network report said. Meanwhile, U.S. Treasurys fell on the speculation that the recently plummeting dollar might prompt foreign central banks to cut their investments in U.S. securities. ""If that's true [reports of Chinese sales], you can see a further rise in interest rates, which would tend to disconcert equity buyers,"" said Metz. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note was down 10/32 at 100 3/32 to yield 4.24 percent in late trade. See Bond Report. Against the yen, the dollar hit an overnight low of 102.12, the lowest level seen in nearly five years, but recovered and was last up 0.1 percent at 102.58. See Currencies. ""The market is not paying much attention to that [the weak dollar] for the moment, simply because of the fact that oil prices are not really getting out of hand,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market analyst and strategist at S.W. Bach. Instead, he added, the market is focusing on what's expected to be a good holiday shopping season. Upbeat on retail outlook ""Consumer feeling somewhat better than they have been over the past several months, the elections out of the way, a brighter job market and a strong stock market [are], I think, setting us up for a strong selling season,"" said Cardillo. Retail stocks were under the microscope on so-called ""Black Friday"" -- the official launch of the holiday shopping season. See related story.

Penney JCP, -0.98% Costco COST, +2.63% and Saks SKS, +0.75% posted gains, among others. See Retail Stocks. Steel stocks were a bright spot, rallying on news that Japanese automaker Nissan Motor NSANY, -0.65% will have to cut production due to a shortage of steel materials. See Market Focus. Steelmakers were the beneficiaries. U.S. Steel X, +4.92% rose 7 percent, with Steel Dynamics STLD, +3.56% up 5 percent, Nucor NUE, +2.98% gaining nearly 6 percent, International Steel Group ISG, +0.27% rising 4.1 percent and AK Steel AKS, +5.84% rallying 14 percent.

AAXN,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Shares of stun-gun maker Taser International tumbled Friday, hit by a New York Times report that raised new safety concerns about the company's main product line. Taser TASR shares ended down $3.51, or 7 percent, to $47 in Friday's abbreviated post-Thanksgiving Day session. The article in the New York Times, citing unpublished results of Air Force Research Laboratory tests, adds to a growing body of complaints over the use and safety of Taser's stun guns. According to the paper, the Air Force said at a symposium last week that Taser stun guns may be dangerous and require further testing. The Air Force's comments fly in the face of a recent federal study that called Taser's products ""generally safe and effective."" Company executives could not be reached for comment. Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Taser markets its guns as nonlethal self-protection devices, with law enforcement agencies and security companies making up its biggest customer base. According to the company, its products send a nonlethal jolt of electricity to subdue the target body. But there has been a rash of complaints in recent months blaming Taser stun guns for accidental injuries, raising the specter of debilitating lawsuits. Taser shares have shed about 13 percent of their value in just the past two weeks.

AAXN,"Mark Hulbert continues to find himself at odds with loyal VIX followers. At the urging of readers, he reviewed the S&P 500-to-VIX ratio used by many market timers -- but his results still make him a skeptic. Gold's steady move higher over the last several months doesn't seem to have made much of an impression on the gold bugs tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest, reports Peter Brimelow, citing the Hulbert Gold Newsletter Sentiment Indicator. But Michael Ashbaugh says there's good reason to be bullish on stocks for the long term. Last week, Herb Greenberg had the scoop on Sears when he was the first to report on Vornado Realty Trust's investment in the retailer. Now it appears that Vornado may have more of an interest in the land under the stores than the stores themselves. And with 76 million baby boomers marching toward retirement, Robert Powell examines stocks poised to benefit from the graying population. In The Guru's Corner, DRIP Investor's Charles Carlson talks about how new investors can avoid high broker fees by buying stocks through dividend reinvestment plans and now that the election's a memory, Jack Rothstein of Wealthcast names four tech picks poised to benefit post-election.

Steiner, which operates spas on 114 cruise ships for major cruise operators, as well as land-based spas at 64 resorts, upheld this impressive record despite dour third-quarter cruise ship earnings following four Florida hurricanes. Upside, which initiated coverage of Steiner in June, noted in an August upgrade report that Steiner's growth prospects could be impacted by cruise operators opting to supplant Steiner with their own in-house spa services. ""One potential fly in the ointment is increased competition from cruise operators,"" said editor Richard Moroney. ""Late last year, select ships of Princess Cruises began offering their own in-house spa service,"" Moroney noted. Similarly, Motley Fool Rule Breakers' contributor Rick Munarriz, who initiated coverage in November, also cited concerns: ""The (economic) moat is a concern because there is nothing to keep a land-based rival- or the cruise companies themselves- from trying to replace Steiner at sea,"" Munarriz observed. But Steiner may have been able to stave off its first real competition. In a Rule Breakers update last week, editor David Gardner mentioned Steiner's response to a rumor that the manager of Princess Cruises' in-house spa services had resigned. ""Without confirming the report, Steiner said its Princess spas were outperforming the in-house Princess spa services, and that Steiner would be eager to jump in if Princess pulls the plug on its in-house efforts,"" Gardner said. On the Motley Fool message boards, Munarriz speculated that ""If all this plays out that way (which is probably more theory and conjecture at this point) you have a public example of a company that tried to go in-house, but is not happy with the results. That should scare away others from trying,"" said Munarriz. That could allow Steiner's investors to shift their concerns back to the long-term fundamentals of the cruise ship industry. Steiner's symbiotic relationship with cruise ship operators means that, as Munarriz describes it, ""A half-empty sailing will translate into a half-empty appointment book at the spa."" --Ari Charney Order: HFD Newsletter Performance Profiles R.I.P. for MPT banner After 25 years, the MPT Review gets a new name and format. MPT was an acronym for Modern Portfolio Theory. Editor Louis Navellier feels that the title ""Emerging Growth"" better reflects the newsletter's new focus. Starting in January, Navellier will drop the current 12 model portfolios -- which new customers ""found confusing"" -- in favor of one large buy list, similar to the format of his sister publication, the Blue Chip Growth Letter. Navellier said his overall goal was to make the strategy easier to implement. He also confessed that commission costs have fallen so dramatically, that it is less important to have different model portfolios for different portfolio sizes. Additionally, the newsletter will begin electronic delivery of weekly hotlines and flash alerts as well as an earnings calendar on its Web site. Currently, MPT offers portfolios for conservative, moderate and aggressive investors with portfolio sizes ranging from $50,000 to over $4 million. The composite average of these current model portfolios, in combination with some discontinued ones, has garnered Navellier a fifth-place position out of fifty newsletters the Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked over that last fifteen, achieving returns of 14.7 percent annually. -- Jimmy Sterns More from MarketWatch Can the Democrats Ride a Blue Wave to Midterm Election Wins?

AAXN,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Homeland security stocks were mostly higher Tuesday on the belief that sector fundamentals will remain positive whatever the outcome of the presidential election. The sector shrugged off a near 6 percent tumble in security systems maker Compudyne, which reported late Monday a wider-than-expected third-quarter loss. ""No matter which party controls the White House, we see the federal government focusing concentration on further securing aviation, securing ports, borders and mass transit, protecting infrastructure and strengthening identification and tracking of individuals,"" said Morgan Keegan analyst Brian Ruttenbur. Among Ruttenbur's highest, or ""outperform"" rated stocks, American Science and Engineering ASEI tacked on 7.4 percent to $39.88, Lasercard LCRD headed 2.3 percent higher to $9.20, OSI Systems OSIS, +2.61% rallied 3.7 percent to $18.79, First Advantage FADV lost 0.3 percent to $16.75 and Verint Systems VRNT, +13.90% fell 0.7 percent to $38.62. Among biometric technology companies, or those that provide individual identification and authentication systems and services, Identix IDNX shot up 5.9 percent to $7.70. Lehman Brothers analyst Jeffrey Kessler upgraded the industry leader's stock to ""outperform"" from ""equal weight"" on the belief that the biometrics industry ""may finally be ready for 'prime time' in 2005."" ""U.S. government-awards flow on biometrics over the next 24 months will convince investors that biometrics is a growth business,"" Kessler said. ""Biometrics is a $1 billion industry and is expected to grow to a multi-billion dollar industry in 3 to 5 years."" Also in the biometrics business, Viisage Technology VISG fell 0.2 percent to $7.26 and Cogent Inc. COGT, -3.85% added 2.4 percent to $19.55. Meanwhile, Compudyne Corp. CDCY dropped 5 percent to $6.75, and hit a 20-month low of $6.13 in intraday trading. The company reported late Monday a third-quarter loss of $1.9 million, or 23 cents a share, compared with earnings of $982,000, or 12 cents a share a year ago, and much wider than the average analysts' estimate compiled by Thomson First Call of a loss of 5 cents a share. Friedman Billings Ramsey reiterated its ""underperform"" rating as the company's attack-protection division was unlikely to turn a profit soon and as quality problems continue to prompt expensive repairs. Among other more active security stocks, Taser International TASR rose 0.6 percent to $41.81, RAE Systems RAE, +8.70% was moving up 2 percent to $7.37 and Armor Holdings AH, +3.65% slipped 0.8 percent to $36.50.

AAXN,"LOS ANGELES (CBSMW) -- When investors follow the crowd, they rarely have positive results. When we started this a column a year ago, it wasn't with the intention of studying investor behavior or to come up with any sort of new and improved trading methodology. It's still not. See current Stock of the month. But in our efforts to take an extra look at big volume movers each month, and offer some alternative stock recommendations -- presented by a panel of independent investment letter editors -- we came up with some surprising results. Following the herd After 12 months, if investors traded the stock of the month on the day each column was published -- buying when the herd was buying and shunning when the herd was selling -- they would have lost 3 percent, based on the closing price on Nov. 3, 2003 through the closing price on Nov. 1, 2004. The herd guessed wrong seven out of 12 months. Investors using the stock of the month as a contrary indicator -- shunning when the herd was buying and buying when the herd was selling -- would have garnered a 9 percent gain. That's a 2.3 percent improvement over the Standard & Poor's 500 Index SPX, +1.38% during the same period and 12 percent better than the herd. If investors had followed the consensus opinion of the newsletter writers invited to comment on the heavy movers -- buying on a majority opinion of Buy or Hold and shunning when the majority opinion was to avoid the stock -- returns would have been 11 percent, or 14 percent better than the herd. Our panel missed six out of 12 months. Going with the gurus The real shocker, however, was the performance results of the recommended stocks by our panel. Each month, we featured three experts offering one alternative stock pick. Some of these stocks were recommended for short-term trading, while others were suggested as long-term holds. Had investors traded these three-stock portfolios in each of the past 12 months, they would have nearly doubled their money -- earning a hefty 94.9 percent. Such trading wouldn't have been for the faint of heart, however. These portfolios lost four out of 12 months. The worst month, April 2004, saw a decline of 45.4 percent. The best month, May 2004, leapt 65.5 percent. Those months also saw the best and worst single stock performance, with Sina SINA, +4.55% shooting up 38.3 percent in May and Conexant CNXT, +2.41% receding 30.6 percent in April. No one would recommend using this column to actively trade the stocks mentioned each month. Simply, 12 data points are hardly proof of a reliable methodology. Not to mention that the writers on our panel didn't make their recommendations with a one-month trading window in mind. But there are two conclusions that we believe investors can safely draw from this. First, going with the crowd rarely takes you where you want to go. Second, stocks recommended by our panel of advisers are probably worth a second look.

AAXN,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Taser shares tumbled nearly 15 percent Monday ahead of a CBS News' scheduled airing of a video that the network said shows a fatality involving the company's much-hyped stun gun. An ""Eye on America"" segment will be shown during the evening newscast, which airs at 6:30 p.m. in New York, and will focus on an official report about a prisoner who died after being shot with a Taser gun, according to CBS. Taser's fall was just the latest blow to the stock TASR which has seen its value drop by nearly one-half in the past month amid safety questions. Shares of Taser closed down $4.29 at $25.23. In April, the stock set an all-time high of $64.14. Discuss Taser. Last week, the stock shed nearly 20 percent after newspaper reports called into question Taser's claims of its ""less-lethal"" weapon's safety. The Taser stun gun, typically used in police work, is the company's flagship product. See full story. Just a week ago, news releases from the company referred to its stun guns as ""advanced, non-lethal"" weapons. The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company sought to refute the reports. It said that to correct ""all the misleading information would require a manuscript longer that the article itself."" Taser says that police avoided serious injuries or death in at least 5,000 incidents by using the stun gun instead of a conventional firearm. Analyst Brian Ruttenbur of Morgan Keegan maintained his ""market perform"" rating on the volatile stock, cautioning that these concerns could linger. ""This has been building for awhile and it will remain an issue with the press,"" he said. ""As we hear more and more about deaths related to Taser, there's going to be an outcry for independent health research into what's really causing this."" Lost in the fallout triggered by the stories, Taser delivered earnings Tuesday that came in above the average Wall Street forecast, as revenue rose fourfold to $16.3 million. ""The numbers they reported weren't bad; the decline is all based on the concerns of a rising death rate,"" Ruttenbur added.

House passes bill to dilute stock-options rule (2:59 PM ET) WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- House lawmakers on Tuesday overwhelmingly passed a bill to weaken a new accounting rule aimed at reining in the use of corporate stock options.

Supporters of options say they spur job growth and innovation, while critics argue that options enable companies to inflate profits.

SG Cowen now expects Cray to lose 10 cents per share in 2004, down from its prior expectation for a profit of a nickle per share.

Escalon Med Corp ESMC, +3.45% fell more than 6 percent after the Wayne, Pa. laboratory equipment provider extended its offer to acquire London-based Drew Scientific Group until July 2.

It had been forecasting operating income of $100 million with sales growth of 8 to 9 percent in the period.

To some extent, the same kind of banter could be found for any one of those stocks, but the past few weeks clearly have belonged to Ipix IPIX, -4.59% A fixture on the Nasdaq's most-active list lately, the video surveillance technology company has been the favored topic for stock jockeys all over the Web. And judging by the gaudy number of posts -- Ipix had, by far, the busiest message board on Yahoo Monday -- the stock is poised to remain in focus for a while. Shares have more than doubled in the past month, with the big kicker coming when Ipix announced last week that its systems were used at the meeting of finance ministers from the world's eight largest economies. See full story. The company also said it was asked to meet with organizers of the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece, following the G-8 summit. See full story. From there, the bulls began their charge. CostaRicaDreamer mentioned another potential catalyst: ""'60 Minutes' over the weekend highlighted security problems at U.S. chemical plants -- a potential market for Ipix's products.""

I don't know about you, but all the signs point to buying at these levels and holding. I want my million dollars!!""

AAXN,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- The hardware sector led technology stocks slightly higher in early Thursday trading, ahead of a sparse earnings schedule after the bell that includes a report from storage-networking equipment maker McData. Hewlett-Packard HPQ, +1.06% shares continued to rise two days after the Dow component reported better-than-expected quarterly sales, and it remained one of the most active issues on the New York Stock Exchange. High-flying Taser TASR shares fell more than 4 percent to $28.50 in the early going, after a story on Bloomberg.com reported that a survey of the 10 largest local police departments revealed that only three -- Houston, Los Angeles and Miami -- plan to make Taser stun guns available to all members of their forces. At that, Houston has yet to find funding. The company's shares have rallied on expectations that police forces will widely deploy the weapons as gun alternatives. Chipmaker Intel's INTC, +5.00% shares rose about 1.5 percent to $27.48 as one of the Nasdaq's most active stocks. The gain comes a day after its shareholders voted in favor of expensing option grants to employees. The proposal passed with 54 percent in favor of the measure. It is nonbinding, and does not require Intel's board to act, although it must consider the change. In other Intel news, the company's shareholders learned Thursday that a $500 million patent infringement suit was filed by All Computers. The suit alleges that Intel's sales of Pentium processors and other products violate an All Computers patent on regulating high-speed input signals. The company said it contacted Intel about a license but was ignored. Other computer-makers posted gains in the early going, with Sun Microsystems SUNW, +5.56% rising about 2 percent to $3.88, Dell Computer DELL up nearly 1 percent to $34.32 and IBM IBM, +0.60% climbing about a half-percent to $87.50 after it announced an expanded alliance with software-maker Siebel Systems SEBL McData MCDT shares rose 2 cents to $4.57 ahead of its report. Brocade, one of its main rivals, saw its shares rise 8 percent to $5.52 early Thursday after the company beat analyst expectations with help from cost cuts, and posted a slight sales increase from the previous quarter. Brocade also raised its fiscal 2004 earnings target. Ciena CIEN, +2.29% provided one of the sector's low lights, with its shares tumbling 12 percent to $3.43, after the company posted only a slightly narrower fiscal second-quarter loss, compared with the same quarter a year earlier, missing analyst expectations. Looking ahead, Ciena said it expects third-quarter revenue will increase as much as 30 percent from the second quarter.

AAXN,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Google might want to consider $2.718 or $27.18 as a good starting point for its price per share. That was a suggestion made by a reader of this column, who just like 200-plus other readers responded to the question: What's your Google bid? The obscure number is a humorous take on what Google plans to raise: $2,718,281,828, an amount recognized as a mathematically irrational number. See Net stocks: What's your Google bid? Some readers came up with per-share prices, which are meaningless without a share count. But they were humorous responses, nonetheless. From 10 cents to $230 a share, it seems Google's valuation is certainly ... uncertain. Indeed, given the negative tone across the technology sector in the last several weeks, valuations are unsettled. The good news is that technology valuation premiums are down from 100 percent. The bad news is that they're still expensive at levels of 50 percent, when historically they trade at a premium of 30 percent, according to a Merrill Lynch note Friday. This raises the question: Does Google deserve a premium valuation to the Net leaders, like Yahoo and eBay, which have been public since 1996 and 1998, respectively. Yahoo YHOO trades at 82 times this year's consensus earnings estimate of 65 cents and 60 times the '05 profit estimate. EBay EBAY, +0.32% trades at 69 times this year's consensus profit estimate and 52 times next year's. These two leading Internet companies have set the bar and the multiples that could be applied to Google, giving the five-year-old search engine valuations that rival its rivals. One analyst came up with a valuation between $29 billion and $39 billion. About 40 percent of readers said they'd short Google at that price. Then there were about 10 percent of those who wouldn't dare short such a potential rocket ship of a stock. They wouldn't dare step in front of the mad crowds trampling on one another for a piece of the Google tulip. A number of readers also wrote that they'd stay away from Google and that a valuation below $10 billion was reasonable. But one reader said he may be crazy, but he'd be interested at $25 billion. Here are a few responses: Jim Gitney: Just like Taser TASR Ask Jeeves ASKJ and a few others, these stocks and their investors are in for one hell of a surprise.  Marketing stocks nowadays is like selling a new flavor of Coca Cola.  Michael Jackson (read investment pundits) or whoever struts their stuff in front of a national audience getting [people] like me to part with a few dollars to buy it.  Then we all will get buyer's remorse, or worse yet, be forced into it when the institutions start selling the stock at the end of some near term quarter. Shelley Taylor: It is insanity fueled by those children (now defined as under 37) who think they rule the world. The problem is that they haven't had any experience in any other market. They're still seeing the world in the rose-colored glasses of the 90s, which have become even more cloudy with age. Well, it just creates good shorting opportunities for us grown-ups. At 47, I remember the market of 1974-1982. All these ""kids"" are missing is a bit of experience. Multiples of 1000 (give or take 500) are simply fantasy, game-boy kind of adventures. Andrew Zucker: Short it. Even at $25 billion, it's a short. Their true/new competitors have not shown their face in a big way to the public yet. I have read of a few... Healthy pressure on Google to grow will apply downward pressure on their partners like Ask Jeeves -- and ultimately cause survival threatening shifts in business strategies for all of Googles partners. Jim Budney: Seriously, I think that the Google IPO is over-hyped. Yes, in the long run, I have no doubt that the stock will perform close to what eBay has done. What we can probably all assume is that the small investors will be completely out of it, even with a Dutch auction, as huge institutional investors will just outbid everybody and set a high price for the stock. Some of my colleagues and I will just sit back and watch as the price will drop most likely for the first week and a half or so. After, I would probably start looking at buying it. What do you think about all this? James Kim: No way [regarding short Google shares], assuming it's overvalued. Just because something is overvalued now doesn't mean it couldn't continue to be overvalued for quite some time -- that's something we learned the hard way a few years ago. But being overvalued does mean that you shouldn't buy for the long-term... Ellen Chang: It is too risky either way. I will not touch Google until the dust settles... John Bresee: I don't know what Google is worth, but I know that dollar for dollar it's worth more than its competitors because it's effective. The funny thing is everyone talks about how Yahoo is the place where large companies will spend their branding dollars, and that's true, up until the time that they realize that branding campaigns have conversion rates as well. There's nothing about cost per click that is inherently unfriendly to branding, it's just not the norm. The days of the black clad Madison Avenue advertising executive who focuses on ""synergies"" are coming to an end. In their place will be a new wave of spread sheet driven ad execs who communicate true performance to their clients. Any company that sells advertising in a non performance oriented model will take an old fashioned beat down. Why, as a smart executive, would you spend a single dime on non performance oriented marketing before you had maximized all truly measurable performance oriented media? It makes no sense. And, slowly people are figuring it out. Rafe Resenders: My analysts prepared an analysis on Google, assuming a $25 Billion equity capitalization. Just some food for thought on the issue: Given that Google maintains its margins around 40 percent, it will need to achieve approximately 40 percent annual sales growth through 2008 to justify that valuation. If margins drop [to] Yahoo levels of approximately 28 percent it will need to achieve 59 percent annual sales growth. Such growth is obviously not impossible, but certainly not the stuff legends are made of by investing in those expectation levels Sean Kimberly: Given the metrics, you would be an idiot to buy Google at $35 billion. But given the emotion, momentum and psychology behind Google, you may be equally idiotic to short the stock. I think the best way to play Google is to avoid it all together. As it will probably be too expensive to realistically buy, but carries too much positive energy to short. If I was forced to either own it or short it, and couldn't avoid Google, I would buy it and own it as long as momentum and exuberance was pushing it higher, but would set a trailing stop loss at 10 percent and get out with any weakness. Who knows, you might get a pretty hefty bounce out of the gate and make some money. David: The earlier rumored valuations of $20 billion to $25 billion were laughable. $35 billion is something from ""Fantasy Island."" At $35 billion, I wouldn't short it, because I think John Q. Public has a short memory and will still go gaga over the Googster, but if I had money to burn, I'd bet on something more certain -- like Smarty Jones winning the Triple Crown, or the next Woody Allen movie outgrossing ""Titanic."" Vinay Patel: I would like a piece of the Google action and would be interested in investing during the IPO. From the hype that has been brought upon this company's IPO is looking like the price will be high. However the starting price will not reflect the company's true value. Eventually things will balance out. The challenge will be to not get burned during the action. I was wondering how Canadians can get in on the auction? The underwriters do not allow us to open accounts with them. John Cranston: The way I see it, there will be another ""hot"" search engine 2 years from now. First it was Yahoo.  Then it was Alta Vista.  Now it's Google.  Tomorrow it will be someone else, maybe Microsoft's MSFT, +2.10% MSN like you suggested.  No, I wouldn't buy Google for $35 billion. Jeffrey O: The point, of course, is that Google is worth more like $500M than $35 billion. Don't get me wrong. I use it nearly every day, along with Yahoo! and InfoSpace's INSP, -20.00% DogPile and Ask Jeeves (which, unfortunately, now uses Google). But I can't remember the last time I saw any improvement in how it works. The news article option is nice, but it doesn't display the URLs and dates of the articles. The usenet interface is out-right barbaric. The last improvement was when they added lists of group-names to make navigation a little less cumbersome. But I much prefer my old news-reader, NewsWatcher, and its successor, Thoth, which allow me to scan across a list of topics a hundred at a time, or search group names. Security on net transactions is intentionally low. If they really want me to jump on their e-commerce band-wagon they'd better start by increasing strength of encryption by at least a couple orders of magnitude. So, Froogle's out. Jim: As a contrarian, I was thrilled to read your insightful piece on Google at +10 times P/S. Working on Wall Street, I have seen every IPO scam. They take advantage of greed and ego (ex. ownership of Google at IPO prices) and then leave the investor holding the bag (look at China Life's chart the last 3 months). We call it ""IPO Roadkill."" Poor naive speculators (can't call them investors) that fall for this one. Bill Harts: I don't understand your theory about institutions being forced to buy other IPOs to get a piece of Google.  As I read the S-1 it appears that anyone will be able to ""get"" shares -- retail as well as institutional -- so long as they are willing to pay up. Because of this dynamic, I think Google will be a short on Day 1 no matter what.  The auction process will attract thousands of unsophisticated investors with access to, and influence on the pricing.  The offering price will be driven up by people thinking that this will be a traditional IPO flipping opportunity, and it won't be. Chris Sumbs: I'd likely buy into the position until it reached ridiculous overvaluation in the range of 35-40 billion.  Then, sell everything and go short the same amount I originally bought in for.  In addition, I would sell 6 mo. put options while I was riding it up and buy 6 mo. puts while riding it down.  Of course I would double dip, it would be dumb not to.  I've seen this work with great effectiveness; the only problem is determining when the company is overvalued due to the vast uncertainty of the internet behemoth's future revenue and EPS. At any rate, I'd be skeptical with the founders and major investors dumping shares when this thing IPOs, it seems like an easy way to get some major cash out of this company.  And obviously, if you want to get out of a position, you have to find someone to buy it! IPO!!!!!

AAXN,"(Corrects analyst sales forecast in fifth paragraph) SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Stun-gun maker Taser reported Wednesday it had received two new orders totaling $500,000 from police departments, sending shares higher early only to give up their gains by the closing bell. After climbing as high as $34.03 in the session, shares of the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company TASR closed at $31.78, down 2 cents. ""It is exciting to gain a deployment of Taser technology by another large police department,"" said Tom Smith, Taser chief executive officer, in a press release. The company said it had orders from the Toledo police in Ohio and Harris County Sheriff's Office in Houston, the nation's fourth largest city. The orders -- each about $250,000 -- were for the latest X26 gun, which is 60 percent smaller and lighter than the flagship gun, the M26. Compared to the company's first-quarter, average order of about $3,000, ""these are obviously very large,"" Smith said in an interview Wednesday afternoon. ""The new orders are indicative of ongoing acceptance of Taser by police,"" rather than a major sales breakthrough, said Joe Blankenship, vice-president of research for Source Capital Group. Blankenship, who upgraded his rating Tuesday on Taser from ""hold"" to ""buy,"" is forecasting $14.5 million in sales for the current quarter. Blankenship said the latest announcement was probably put out to combat an article in the latest Barron's that suggested the stun-gun market was nearing saturation among large police departments. Smith said the Barron's article was off base. ""We have a bunch of orders, 15 or 20, this size out there that we are working on as we speak,"" Smith said, but declined to specify an agency or state Taser is negotiating with. The company has had to deal with recent media reports, including one by CBS News last month, that dozens of people have died while in police custody after they were shocked with Taser guns. (CBS is owned by Viacom, a significant investor in the publisher of this report.) Taser officials and police have said the deaths were a result of the suspects fighting with police or using drugs, not the guns' electrical shock. Taser stun guns use propelled wires spiked with clinging barbs to deliver a disabling shock. ""In every single case the medical examiner has attributed the direct cause of death in the autopsy reports to causes other than the Taser device,"" Smith said in a press release, following what he called speculation by the media. Blankenship said he understood Smith's frustration, but added, ""Anything, including an independent study, that would more conclusively demonstrate that these weapons are not having a lethal effect, would be helpful."" Smith acknowledged there is at least one study, a Department of Defense review, under way. He didn't know when it would be complete or if the results would be made public. ""Originally, (the results) were supposed to be released to the military in March,"" Smith said.

AAXN,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- In Fedspeak, the open market committee all but told the world yesterday to expect an interest rate hike ahead of the presidential election in November, a move that should excite, not scare technology investors. ""When the Fed raises rates, tech stocks usually do OK,"" says David Briggs, chief equities trader at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. ""When rates are going up, the economy is getting better, and the drivers of the economy usually benefit."" To test Briggs' theory, I took a look this week at changes in the daily effective Fed funds rate dating back to the early years of Alan Greenspan's first term as Fed chief. I shouldn't be surprised that Briggs is right. Technology stocks moved higher in a 12-month period at the start of four of the five past rate-tightening cycles under Greenspan, dating back to 1988. The only time they didn't rise was when the daily effective funds rate began rose from a nadir in August 1987 -- the same month Greenspan took office. Supposedly, stocks don't do well when interest rate rise. Higher rates tend to slow down economic growth and increase the cost of doing business for all companies. Higher rates also tend to push the possibility of dividend payouts farther into the future, which spells trouble for investors who buy stocks based on their discounted stream of cash flows and dividends. In addition, there's a fear among some on Wall Street that rising rates could trigger the insolvency of one or more overleveraged financial institutions -- something that has happened during other rate-tightening cycles. If that happens, it could lead to an expensive financial bailout and another costly hit to shareholder confidence that could send tech stocks tumbling. ""Wall Street is concerned that there are hedge funds out there that are addicted to tremendous short-term borrowing, that rising rates will trigger a financial burnout, and that there could be a spillover effect with counter-party risks spread among several firms,"" says Janes T. Swanson, chief investment strategist for MFS Investment Management, who oversees $142 billion in assets. Yet most economists say most investor fears about rates are overblown. For example, if Wall Street is really concerned about the meltdown of a financial firm or two, that risk is likely factored in to current stock prices. One reason tech stocks may do well in periods of rising rates is that most publicly traded technology companies have no debt. They don't' have to anything to finance with the higher rates. And while their customers certainly finance equipment, a few quarter-point increases won't be enough to put the brakes on demand for computers, chips, software and networking gear. Meanwhile, there are signs in the gross domestic product figures and in corporate earnings reports that spending in the corporate sector is finally starting to improve -- one more reason the Fed feels comfortable in raising rates. Briggs says some stocks are overvalued, such as high-flying stun-gun maker and media darling Taser TASR which trades at more than 60 times earnings. Yet he says there are a few good ones that are worth their price. His firm recently bought up more of chip equipment-maker Applied Materials' AMAT, +2.87% shares, and he says he likes LAM Research LRCX, +3.54% Value plays are out there, too. Nokia NOK, +0.74% which owns about a third of the worldwide cell phone market, is starting to draw the attention of several large hedge fund managers. Even though the company reported a lackluster first-quarter in which it lost market share and guided below analyst expectations for the first quarter, a turnaround is possible later this year, as the company rolls out new flip phones, recently a more popular option than the candy-bar-size phone designs. Nokia sure seems cheap. It's still generating cash, trades at about 14 times 2005 earnings estimates, is down 38 percent from its March peak, has about $2.50 a share in cash on the book. Plus, it has a 2.5 percent dividend yield, points out Al Davis, analyst with McAdams Wright Ragen, so shareholders get paid even if a turnaround takes a while. Technology shareholders should quit fretting and remember why there's pressure to raise rates. It's because things are looking up. Rising demand for credit reflects an expanding economy and increased purchases of technology goods and services. A small hike or two is in order, considering that the key funds rate remains at a 46-year low. That's hardly enough to derail the economy or the technology stock market.

AAXN,"LONDON (CBS.MW) -- U.S. stock futures set hopes for a bounce-back on Monday on hopes that the technology sector will reverse a recent slide. A reading on the manufacturing sector in April will highlight Monday's economic releases, as investors gauge the pace of industrial sector expansion. June S&P futures rose 2.50 to 1,108.60 and Nasdaq 100 futures tacked on 5.50 to 1,408.50. The technology burdened Nasdaq 100 Index $NDX had lost 96 points, or 6.4 percent amid a five session losing streak. Among some high-tech heavyweights seeing early action, Microsoft MSFT, +2.10% added 7 cents to $26.20, Cisco Systems CSCO, +2.95% gained 23 cents to $21.14 and Intel INTC, +5.00% was 17 cents better at $25.90. Markets were already positioning themselves ahead of Federal Reserve's interest rate policy meeting Tuesday (read more) and the closely-watched payrolls report coming on Friday. Chip stocks may move as the Semiconductors Industry Association said the three-month-rolling average sales for March increased 32.3 percent to $16.3 billion. Applied Materials AMAT, +2.87% added 13 cents to $18.40, Novellus Systems NVLS rose 18 cents to $29.12 and ASML ASML, +2.07% was up 34 cents at $15.91.

Morgan said the SIA results were better than expected and hiked its 2004 semiconductor sales forecast from a 22 percent rise year-on-year to a 27 percent gain, though it remains neutral on the semiconductor sector. Merrill Lynch added that the first quarter started off slightly below seasonal trend but ended strongly. ""The seasonal strength in the first quarter underpins our forecast that the industry may grow as much as 30-33 percent in 2004. We plan to revisit that shortly,"" the broker said. Also in technology, publishing software firm Adobe Systems ADBE, +1.67% shot up $1.99, or 4.8 percent, to $43.49 after the company said it expected to exceed prior fiscal second-quarter financial targets due to greater-than-anticipated revenue for its Creative Suite and CS products and its Acrobat product line. Among other stocks on the move, stun gun maker Taser International TASR fell 95 cents, or 2.9 percent, to $31.40.

And Dominick's, a grocery chain owned by Safeway, joined in the outpouring of sympathy for Cantalupo. Investors showed their confidence in the company, whose stock, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, weathered Cantalupo's death with little change. The broader market, after seesawing in response to quarterly earnings reports and rising concerns about potential rate hikes, ended the week higher by the barest of margins but it was enough to send the major U.S. indexes into positive territory year to date.

AAXN,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Shares of stun-gun maker Taser maintained their volatility Wednesday, recovering from an early slide of 16 percent to close near breakeven. Shares TASR closed at $83.75, down 64 cents, or 0.8 percent, markedly above an intraday low of $70.65. The recovery followed a session in which investors cashed in on the shares' recent rally, precipitating the biggest single-day decline in the stock's history. Tuesday's 29 percent plunge came after Taser reported better-than-expected earnings, but added fewer new customers compared with previous quarters. See full story. New orders for February and March, which averaged $4.1 million, were also down 16 percent from $4.9 million in January. ""Put all of these factors together and it just brought them down to earth,"" said Joe Blankenship, vice president of research for Source Capital Group. ""I think the abandonment was fairly complete on Tuesday,"" added Blankenship, who changed his rating from ""hold"" to ""buy"" Wednesday. On Tuesday, the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company beat Wall Street expectations, reporting $3.5 million, or 24 cents a share, in net income, compared with $229,000, or 3 cents a share, in the year-ago period. Wall Street analysts, on average, had expected a penny a share in profit. Taser raked in $13 million in sales during the period, compared with $3.4 million a year before. ""The company's stock split, effective on April 29, 2004, and expected growth in Great Britain will likely buoy sales in the near-term,"" said Brian Ruttenbur, security analyst for Morgan, Keegan & Company. Looking further ahead, Ruttenbur said an independent health study of the risks to (Taser) victims is needed to reassure investors of the product's safety. Some 40 people have died while in police custody after they were shot with Taser's electrified fishhooks, CBS News reported earlier this month. Company officials and police defended the so-called nonlethal weapon, saying those who died fought police or were on drugs at the time they were taken into custody, the report claims. Overall, Ruttenbur said he sees Taser's growth slowing somewhat. ""It's difficult to continue to grow at this hyper-growth rate for a sustained period of time,"" Ruttenbur said. Before Tuesday's sudden drop, Taser's stock had skyrocketed 332 percent since the beginning of the year, climbing from $27 on Jan. 1 to close at $118 on Monday after touching a 52-week high of $128.30 that session. As recently as last Oct. 1, the stock was trading under $10.

AAXN,"SAN DIEGO (CBS.MW) -- I've gone out of my way to avoid writing anything about titillating Taser because I really haven't had anything anybody else didn't have. The stun gun maker's stock, by most rational accounts, was ridiculously overvalued dozens of points ago. That was well before its stock climbed to its current market value of nearly $1.5 billion for a company whose sales this year, based on the most recent quarter, are tracking to be $52 million. Now, however, Taser TASR itself is starting to signal the chinks in its growth story. In its earnings release today, for example, the company said it added 92 police departments to its ""growing list"" of customers. Yet that number, the company said, is lower than previous quarters. Also worth noting: Quarterly sales per employee were also off, tumbling to $61,013 from $71,394 at the end of December. The trend, as it appears, is increasingly not Taser's friend. The stock got juiced in early February after the company announced ""record orders."" But orders for February and March, on average were $4.1 million, sharply below January's $4.9 million, touted in an early February press release. And, considering the orders in the first quarter of $13.1 million were equal to sales, it now appears that backlog has stopped growing, as well. Finally, don't be fooled by the company's brag about cash generation. One of the biggest contributors to that cash, no doubt, is tied to employee options that were exercised as the stock spiraled higher -- hardly something that can be counted on in the future. (Especially if the stock falls.) In the end, like so many mania stocks, Taser could be making stun gun or olive pitters. It's all about the stock. And while it's down around 14 percent Tuesday on what appeared to be better-than-expected earnings, keep in mind it's merely back to where it was a week ago.

The company attributed the strong results to its focus on the completion of its cost reduction program, benefits from the current improvement of the general economy, and price increases for all of its products that mitigated the impact of higher natural gas and steel costs.

Kopin lost $3.4 million, or 5 cents per share, on revenue of $22.4 million in the March quarter.

AAXN,"BOSTON (CBS.MW) -- For the average investor, jumping into the middle of a fray between day-traders, momentum players and short sellers is a bad idea. Put that problem together with extremely high valuations, the potential for share dilution, a wave of insider selling and the potential for scream-inducing downside volatility and you've got an investment that might even frighten away some folks who consider themselves savvy, above-average investors. But when those characteristics show up in the hottest stock Wall Street has seen in years, some investors overlook the danger signs and take the plunge. That's why Taser International TASR is today's pick for Stupid Investment of the Week. Taser, which makes non-lethal weapons for law enforcement (think stun gun), has blown investors away over the past year, a time when it is up more than 6,000 percent. You read that right: Taser is up about 7,000 percent in 18 months, up 6,200 percent over the past 12 months and up nearly 250 percent this year alone. The stock has moved in that time from about $1.50 to roughly $100, and management just announced plans for its second stock split - a two-for-one deal - payable later this month. That split will be highly attractive to some investors, as it will make Taser ""more affordable"" by cutting the price in half. Increased affordability, however, is not necessarily a reason to buy. Stupid Investment of the Week is designed to highlight the characteristics and traits that make an investment less than ideal for the average consumer, in the hope that pointing out such flaws in one security will make them easier to find in another. While obviously not a buy recommendation, neither is Stupid Investment of the Week intended as an automatic sell signal, as there may be times when unloading a troubled investment merely compounds the problem. Any long-term Taser investor, for example, is facing an enormous capital gains tax bill (a nice problem to have, but one that should not be ignored). It's equally important to recognize that Stupid Investment of the Week recognizes an investment at a certain point in time. While no one should minimize the circumstances that lead to a 6,000 percent gain in a year, neither should anyone think that Taser's prospects at $100 per share are the same as its potential $50 or more ago. That price appreciation makes past investors look brilliant, but it's a siren song for newcomers. ""For any stock to have this kind of a meteoric rise, there's a great story to fuel the enthusiasm,"" explains Ken Tower, chief market strategist for CyberTrader, which is owned by Charles Schwab. ""The problem is that when you grow at such a rapid pace, it is almost impossible to construct a scenario where you continue to grow at the same rate and justify the enormous p/e ratio you've got. ""The worry for average investors is what happens when a stock that has gone crazy on the upside winds up having any bad news. The downside risks are tremendous."" That's the problem with Taser, rather than the company's business model or fundamentals. Taser is a ""story stock,"" one with an outstanding tale to tell. The company's products are increasingly the talk of the law-enforcement world because they give officers the chance to end an altercation while reducing the need to use lethal force. Heightened security and safety concerns give the products a huge potential market. Throughout the stock market bubble of the 1990s, story stocks went through a cycle of popping on the story, then crashing on bad news and lousy fundamentals. Taser doesn't have bad fundamentals. While its earnings aren't enormous, they are real. So, too, is the company's sales growth. And the 12-week backlog in orders. The one negative that some investors have been hanging on the stock is what could happen if it loses any wrongful death lawsuits. A CBS Evening News story this week suggested that Taser products may have played a role in some 40 law enforcement deaths, but company officials disputed the claim. More importantly, the market immediately discounted the news, a good sign that lawsuits alone aren't likely to exhaust the fuel in this rocket. Look at the financials and listen to the story and you could make a good case for owning the stock. Just not for the average investor at this price, nor at the one it will have when it splits at the end of the month. And not when you look at who is fueling the continued movement. Taser's price/earnings ratio over the past year is about 300, and it's forward-looking p/e ratio for the next year is about 70. The price-to-book ratio is about 45, a level so high that many analysts say they've never seen a company carrying that number do well in the future. Call me a pessimist, but I see numbers like that and I see a stock priced at a level where expectations have become unreasonable. ""The company may well have a bright future, but it will take so many years for the earnings to pan out based on today's price that you will have to hold it forever and things will have to pan out perfectly,"" says Mark Sellers, editor of the Morningstar Stock Investor newsletter. ""It can't be undervalued at this price, and it will need to increase revenues and earnings at an almost triple-digit rate just to make the current stock price remotely reasonable."" Other factors working against Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Taser as an addition to the average investor's portfolio include the high turnover of outstanding shares and the heavy short position. Insiders are selling shares, although you can hardly blame them for locking in their huge profits (of course, had they thought the company was worth $100 per share, they might not have come public at about $3 per share in 2001). ""It's a trader stock right now, where you are stuck between the momentum guys and the shorts and the day-traders,"" says Robert V. Green, editor at Briefing.com. ""By definition, that's not the where an average investor wants to be. ""If the company has any kind of slip-up and the momentum crowd decides it's no longer the place to be, it's looking at a 50 percent drop overnight, and it's the average guy hoping this thing would keep going who gets stuck with it then."" Shares of Taser added $1.76, or 1.8 percent, to close Thursday at $99.80. Editor's note: Chuck Jaffe does not own this stock and is not short in Taser.

AAXN,"CHICAGO (CBS.MW) -- Taser shares powered ahead to all-time highs again Wednesday, a day after the company announced its second stock split in as many months and rebutted a report that its stun guns were lethal. After vaulting more than 21 percent Tuesday, Taser TASR shares set a new peak of $100.30 Wednesday, up nearly 9 percent. At the session's close, shares were higher by $5.79 at $98.04. In the last year, Taser shares have catapulted a stunning 6,200 percent as the company has stepped up marketing efforts and sales to police departments throughout the U.S. In midday trading Wednesday, more than 14.8 million shares had changed hands -- more than double its daily average volume. The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based maker of what it calls ""advanced less-lethal weapons"" is splitting its stock 2-for-1 on or about April 29 to shareholders of record April 15. It was just Feb. 11 that the company held a 3-for-1 stock split as a move to trim the stock's price. The huge jumps in stock prices come after the company spent most of the first two years as a publicly held company in a $1 to $2 range. Wednesday's rally also comes after a two-part ""CBS Evening News"" series questioning just how nonlethal the stun guns are. The reports said 40 people have died in police custody after being stunned with the Taser guns. The weapons transmit electrical pulses through high-voltage insulated wires. A coroner told CBS that in the death cases he's seen there was an ""underlying problem"" that the jolt could have aggravated. The shock might, for example, impair breathing, which could lead to death. The company insists that those stunned generally already were fighting with police, delirious or on drugs. ""There may be a small group of people that once it's used, may develop difficulties that may result in death,"" forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Anderson said on Tuesday night's report. On the Taser Web site, the company lists all 40 people who have died and the circumstances and causes surrounding their deaths. ""In all of those cases where autopsy reports are available the medical examiners have not listed the Taser as the cause of death in even one instance,"" Chief Executive Rick Smith said in a statement. ""If the Taser had not been used, all 40 of those people would still be dead today,"" Smith said. ""In every single case, these people would have died anyway."" Families, however, told CBS News that there was no way to be certain of that. And CBS News also reported Tuesday that at least one victim's autopsy report listed ""cause of death"" as ""electrical shock,"" according to the program. CBS parent Viacom is a substantial shareholder in MarketWatch.com, the publisher of this report. From an earnings viewpoint, analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call expect Taser to generate earnings of 22 cents a share on average in the fiscal first quarter, a 633 percent leap over the year-ago profit.

The Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company also responded to a ""CBS Evening News"" report aired Monday that stated 40 people have died after being stunned with Taser guns. Taser TASR shares surged immediately after the company announced its 2-for-1 stock split. The stock raced to a 52-week peak of $94.84 -- up 21 percent, or $16.35. The day's trading volume more than doubled to nearly 15 million. The company said the stock split would be payable on or about April 29 to shareholders of record on April 15. Taser shareholders are to receive one share of common stock for every share already held. The number of outstanding shares is expected to jump to 28.3 million. Responding to Monday night's TV report, Taser confirmed that approximately 40 people have died while in police custody after being stunned, but it added that, ""in all of those cases where autopsy reports are available the medical examiners have not listed the Taser as the cause of death in even one instance. ""We are always saddened with loss of a loved one for the grieving families, but all of the medical testing we have done and the tens of thousands of uses of Taser conducted energy weapons by police have clearly established the medical safety of this product,"" Chief Executive Rick Smith said in a statement. On the CBS news program, Smith had said that the Taser gun was not to blame because most of the victims were fighting with police, delirious or on drugs. ""If the Taser had not been used, all 40 of those people would still be dead today,"" says Smith. ""In every single case, these people would have died anyway.""

CHICAGO (CBS.MW) -- U.S. stocks opened lower Tuesday after Nokia NOK, +0.74% cautioned its first quarter earnings would come in at the lower end of its forecast range. The negative early bias suggests that while the bullish uptrend that started almost two weeks ago remains intact, it may be due for a pause. This first chart above is a five-minute chart of the Nasdaq that illustrates the past two sessions -- Friday and Monday. The most obvious take-away above ties to the strength of the Nasdaq's near-term uptrend. Note that even on this narrow two-day time frame, the index has experienced limited intraday pullbacks. A separate point ties to the well-defined technical levels over the past two sessions. From current levels, the Nasdaq faces initial support around 2,064 followed by an additional floor at 2,055. This second chart is an hourly chart of the Nasdaq that widens the view to the prior 10 sessions. Recall that exactly two weeks ago the stage appeared set for a near-term bounce. The Nasdaq had pulled back to its 200-day moving average which, at the time, matched well with the November and December lows. As the chart above illustrates, the index not only experienced a corrective bounce, it has also undertaken a sizeable nine-session run. From bottom to top, the Nasdaq has run 182 points, or 9.6 percent. The Dow industrial average has a similar look to the Nasdaq above. Since breaking higher nine sessions ago, the Dow has trended well from its 20-period moving average. Note that each pullback to that near-term trending average has been regarded as a buying opportunity. Over the past nine sessions, the Dow has added 551 points or 5.5 percent. The near-term picture on the S&P 500 matches closely with the other two indices. Again, the index has trended closely above its 20-period moving average for eight consecutive sessions. Yet unlike the Dow and the Nasdaq, the S&P remains within striking distance of its 52-week high. At Monday's close, the index held just 13 points from its one-year peak. This next chart is a daily chart of the S&P 500 that widens the view to the past six months. With Monday's 8-point gain, the S&P continued to place distance above its 50-day moving average. Like the S&P 500, the Dow also placed distance above its 50-day moving average Monday. Note the Dow is currently approaching its first ""real"" resistance since the rally started nine sessions ago. The Nasdaq followed Friday's technically significant break above its 50-day moving average with another solid gain Monday. It posted a light volume gain of 22 points Monday, or 1.1 percent. The bigger picture At this point, the Nasdaq faces two competing interests. The overbought near-term condition engendered by the recent rally, versus the favorable technical backdrop created by Friday's employment report. The near-term question is whether the index can extend itself on this nine session, 182-point run and still proceed to take out 2,091 without a period of consolidation. Yet to be clear, both the near-term and the longer-term outlook remain bullish. The major averages have each reclaimed their 50-day simple moving averages. At the same time, the S&P 500 is within striking distance of a 52-week high. So as suggested Monday, the corrective bounce that started two weeks ago has begun to look more sustainable. The ""watch out"" would be for a strong volume reversal over the next several sessions that takes the indices back below their 50-day moving averages. Absent that kind of sell pressure, both the near-term and longer-term picture favors additional gains, and traders will want to favor long positions on pullbacks to support. Tuesday's watch list The charts below identify several names worth watching from a technical perspective. These are intended as radar screen names -- sectors or stocks that appear well positioned for a potential move in the specified direction over the near term. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance SanDisk SNDK $31.73 $30.62 $31.62 SanDisk SNDK looks well positioned to rise. Over the past two sessions, it has cleared its five-month downtrend (illustrated in green) and its 200-day moving average. At Monday's close, it had also edged just above resistance at $31.62, which approximates the bottom of the gap created in mid-January. The near-term outlook should favor additional upside barring a break back below its 200-day moving average at $30.62. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Taser International TASR $78.60 $77.80 $83.77 The chart above is an hourly chart of Taser International TASR that goes back 10 sessions. Taser was initially profiled March 19 and revisited March 30. Yet following a nine-session 40-percent gain, we grew more cautious on the near-term outlook Thursday. Monday, it was the Nasdaq's leading point loser. The overall technical story is essentially the same. While its relative strength still makes it a risky short candidate, the recent 40-percent run followed by last week's strong volume sell-off make for an unfavorable risk/reward picture over the near-term. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Airspan Networks AIRN $6.42 $5.61 $6.43 While the broad markets work to reassert the bull trend, Airspan Networks AIRN, +0.00% is challenging three-year highs. The shares closed Monday one penny shy of initial resistance at $6.43 which matches the March high. Note that each break higher over the past six weeks has occurred on above average volume. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Witness Systems WITS $14.04 $12.85 $14.05 Witness Systems WITS was initially profiled January 26 and revisited March 31. Yet despite its recent gains, the shares remain well situated to rise. The near-term outlook would further improve on a break above resistance at $14.05 which matches the March high. Note the April rally has occurred behind a sustained surge in volume. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance iVillage IVIL $7.98 $6.83 New High Profiled Thursday, iVillage IVIL has returned 16.4 percent in just three sessions. From current levels, look for the shares to find support on pullbacks to the January high at $6.83. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Netopia NTPA $13.85 $13.00 $14.90 Netopia NTPA edged above its 50-day moving average Monday and appears poised to resume its former uptrend. Note the current picture has begun to take the shape of a bullish double bottom (the ""W"" shape spanning from February through April). The pattern would be resolved with a break above resistance at $14.90 which matches the February and March highs. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Retail Index RLX 403.70 396 403 The Retail Index edged to a 52-week high Monday. Well positioned sector components include: Best Buy BBY, +2.09% J.C. Penney (JCP: news, chart, profile), Sherwin-Williams (SHW: news, chart, profile), Toys R Us (TOY: news, chart, profile) and Federated (FD: news, chart, profile). Retail names Fossil FOSL, +2.09% and Urban Outfitters URBN, +1.59% (not components of the RLX) are also well positioned. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance ImmunoGen IMGN $8.17 $7.29 New High Profiled in The Technical Indicator Monday morning, ImmunoGen IMGN, -2.05% subsequently broke to a 52-week high. It was among the Nasdaq's leading percentage gainers, carving out a single-day gain of 11.3 percent. Though admittedly extended on a near-term basis, the longer-term outlook should favor additional gains barring a break below support at $7.29 which matches the January high.

Michael Burke of Investors Intelligence seems to thinks so and Mark takes a look at two of the stocks that caught Burke's eye. Peter Brimelow reviews the newsletters, finding a number of ""grumps"" who are feeling a little bearish these days.

In The Guru's Corner, David Fry of the ETF Digest gives us a first quarter roundup on exchange-traded funds and Elliott Gue of Wall Street Winners takes a look at silver.

As the U.S. comes out of a three-year recession, China's economy has been roaring at a rate of more than 7 percent annually over the same period. Not surprisingly, a growing number of investment newsletters are shifting their focus into Chinese companies or recommending Chinese stocks. Signaling their enthusiasm for Chinese stocks, editors Carlton and Timothy Lutts have changed the name of the Cabot Sector Inspector investment letter to Cabot's China Investor. Initially launched as the Cabot Internet Stock Letter, the pair previously changed the name when they went to a multi-sector approach. ""We think the investment potential in China is huge! We think it holds even more potential than the Internet sector held six years ago,"" argued the Lutts. As China has become one of the biggest consumers of natural resources in the world, more and more newsletter gurus are also recommending Chinese energy, oil, minerals, and natural gas companies. Louis Navellier of Blue Chip Growth Letter already has three Chinese natural gas and mineral stocks in his portfolio and planning to add more citing the enormous growth potential in the natural resources sector in China. BI Research, Profitable Investing, Oxford Club -- are also recommending Chinese companies. Most notable among the Chinese stocks recommended recently by newsletter editors are PetroChina PTR, -0.14% Huaneng Power International HNP, +0.90% Aluminum Corporation of China ACH, +3.57% Continental Minerals KMKCF and China Petroleum & Chemical SNP, +3.22% -- M. Bobby Syed Order: HFD Newsletter Performance Profiles Listening to specialists The market's recent downturn inspired InvesTech Research Market Analyst to dust off a classic technical indicator to support its still bullish sentiment: The Specialist Short Sales Ratio. This ratio compares NYSE specialists' short sales to the total short sales of all other NYSE participants. It first received widespread exposure among the investing public because of a chapter devoted to it in Norman Fosback's (who now edits Fosback's Fund Forecaster) landmark 1976 book Stock Market Logic. With more than 440 specialists on the NYSE trading floor, the indicator still holds some allure for investors who believe that they have an informational edge. The specialist trades against the prevailing trend of a stock, acting as counterparty whenever there is an excess of buyers or sellers, thus maintaining liquidity and reining in pricing volatility. The specialist must possess the trading savvy to perform this public service while also making money for his firm. To support this dual role, the specialist enjoys access to the Display Book, an electronic workstation, which continuously tracks all limit orders and incoming market orders. Unfortunately, it has become increasingly difficult to measure specialists' short selling behavior in a meaningful way relative to the investing public. In recent years, the total public short sales statistic has been significantly diluted by the short selling volume resulting from two structural shifts in the investing world: the rapid increase in hedge funds and the explosion of convertible debt issuance. To address the massive increase in public short selling, InvesTech, has recalibrated the indicator. In reviewing data from 1976 through 2004, the publication reset the bullish threshold to fall between 36 percent and 38 percent, lower than Fosback's original threshold of 45 percent. During a market decline, a reading under 35 percent indicates that specialists maintain a bullish outlook -- and with the indicator currently reading 28 percent, it's now at the lowest level in its 50-year history, according to InvesTech. ""Readings under 35 percent have shown a 98 percent probability of higher stock prices 12 months down the road,"" the newsletter noted. The Hulbert Financial Digest began monitoring InvesTech since January 1984. Since then, InvesTech has returned 6.8 percent annually through the end of February, vs. 12.5 percent for the Wilshire 5000 TMW, +0.00% -- Ari Charney Sibling rivalry InvesTech's sister publication, InvesTech Research Mutual Fund Advisor, is making some changes to its current format, promising a stronger focus on portfolio strategy and security analysis. Along with the model portfolio, which includes both funds and stocks, the publication will start running an alternative, all mutual fund portfolio that applies the same strategy. The publication also plans to offer more detailed information on individual portfolio positions and defensive hedges. InvesTech Research Mutual Fund newsletter achieved an annualized return of 9.4 percent since the beginning of 1986, when the Hulbert Financial Digest began tracking the publication. This compares to a 12 percent annual gain by the Wilshire 5000 Index over the same period. -- Jimmy Sterns Fool-ish funds The Motley Fool recently launched Motley Fool Champion Funds, a move that must have Motley Fool Stock Advisor subscribers scratching their heads. Founding editors David and Tom Gardner recently issued an ""Urgent Investing Bulletin,"" numbering more than 20 pages, entitled The Case Against Mutual Funds, where the brothers Gardner warn against buying nearly all mutual funds. The new mutual fund letter is edited by former Morningstar analyst Shannon Zimmerman and marks the Fool's first foray into mutual fund investing. Each issue features two new fund picks that have passed Zimmerman's rigorous screens, which include broad, risk controlled diversification, a manager with a historical record of beating the S&P and no-load funds whose expense ratios either justify their performance or compare favorably to the mutual fund universe. In grading funds, Zimmerman also applies what he calls the ""X factor,"" which looks at the quality of the fund family, 12b-1 fees and risk level of the portfolio's investments. In addition, there will be a fund given the dubious title of ""dud of the month"" which Zimmerman insists you shouldn't touch with the proverbial ten-foot pole. -- John Kimble More from MarketWatch Why It Feels Like Facebook Is Listening Through Your Mic More Coverage Bloodbath for cryptocurrencies as Bitcoin sheds 10%, now down 40% year-to-date Three reasons the stock market’s fundamentals look solid My husband sold his grandmother’s house and paid off our mortgage — now his family is threatening to sue","Mar 30, 2004 3:12 p.m. ET",1,Chinese takeout and Fool-ish funds,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/chinese-takeout-and-fool-ish-funds

CHICAGO (CBS.MW) -- The pre-market bias is lower Tuesday behind modest losses in European and Asian markets. Early sell pressure follows yet another session of considerable gains Monday. On a percentage basis, the Nasdaq led Monday's rally rising 32 points, or 1.6 percent. At the same time, the Dow added 116 points, or 1.1 percent, while the S&P 500 gained 14.4 points, marking a single-day rally of 1.3 percent. Yet despite Monday's sizeable gains, the broader technical question remains essentially the same. Does this three-day rally mark a resumption of the previous bull trend, or is it merely a corrective bounce following the Nasdaq's massive two-month 11.8 percent pullback? The Nasdaq's hourly chart above illustrates the magnitude of its recent rally. In a matter of just four sessions, the index has lifted a full 100 points, or 5.3 percent. Note the three sessions of tight consolidation beginning last Monday had the index well positioned to rise. Not surprisingly, the near-term picture on the S&P 500 is similar to the Nasdaq. Nonetheless, there is one notable difference between the two indices. Despite Monday's rally, the S&P 500 failed to break outside its two-week range. In fact, it topped just shy of resistance at 1,126 which matches an area of interest going back to March 18. The Dow Industrials has a similar look to the S&P 500. While the Dow did edge to a new two-week high Monday it ended the session at 10,329 - an almost exact match with its former high at 10,328. Note the resistance on both the S&P 500 and the Dow were specifically singled out in the March 22 review. Widening the view So on a near-term basis, the Nasdaq continues to exhibit relative strength. It's the only of the three major indices to break outside its two-week range. By way of comparison, the Dow and the S&P 500 have lifted to observe resistance, but have yet to take out those two-week highs. Yet while the indices contend with well-defined near-term resistance, they face notable broader levels of interest as well. The three charts below are daily charts of the major averages that each go back six months. The real story from a technical perspective ties to the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA). Based on the current picture, the Dow's 20-day moving average rests at 10,287. So Thursday's close at 10,329 placed it just 42 points above this near-term trending average. The daily chart on the S&P 500 illustrates a picture similar to the Dow. Monday's close at 1,122 placed the S&P just 4 points above its 20-day moving average. The Nasdaq was the only major average to place noticeable distance above its 20-day EMA. Monday's close at 1,992 came in roughly 21 points, or 1.1 percent, above that near-term trending average. Nonetheless, the Nasdaq has yet to clear its two-month downtrend illustrated in green. Note that each test of that two-month downtrend has been preceded by an ""encouraging"" break above the 20-day moving average. The bigger picture So we still face this question of how to interpret Monday's rally. The direct answer is the near-term bias remains higher. Yet as the chart above illustrates, it's still early to get overly bullish regarding the intermediate-term outlook. In a broader sense, the Nasdaq experienced a three-day test of its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) last week. It then found the support you would conventionally expect, and lifted to test that two-month downtrend (illustrated in green) over just four sessions. So while the nature of the price movement has not been unexpected, the recent rally has occurred quickly. At any rate, the strong move lower has occurred, and the corrective bounce has occurred. Over the next several sessions, watch for whether the major averages begin to trend under their 20-day exponential moving averages, or establish a sustainable posture above them. To reiterate a point from last week, even if the indices would reclaim their 20-day moving averages it would only mark a first step to improving the broader outlook. The markets will need to clear their more distant 50-day moving averages before the current bounce might be taken more seriously. Tuesday's Watch List The charts below identify several names worth watching from a technical perspective. These are intended as radar screen names - sectors or stocks that appear well positioned for a potential move in the specified direction over the near term. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance TASER International TASR $74.29 $67.75 New High Initially profiled in The Technical Indicator March 19, Taser International TASR has returned 19 percent in just seven sessions. Monday it was the Nasdaq's third-leading point gainer, carving out a single-day gain of 7.7 percent. The near-term outlook should favor additional gains barring a break below support around $67.75 which matches the February high. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Oncolytics Biotech ONCY $6.18 $5.45 New High Profiled last Tuesday, Oncolytics Biotech ONCY broke substantially higher Monday. It was the Nasdaq's tenth-leading percentage gainer posting a single-day advance of 17.1 percent. Though admittedly extended on a near-term basis, the longer-term picture will favor further gains barring a break below the former March high at $5.45. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Netflix NFLX $33.39 $30.00 $33.66 Netflix NFLX, +3.35% isn't touching new highs, but nonetheless looks well positioned to rise. Monday it cleared a two-month downtrend (in green) and lifted straight to a test of its 50-day moving average at $33.66. Note the bullish near-term outlook would be placed in question on a break back below that former downtrend which currently rests around $30.00. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Qualcomm QCOM $65.61 $64.75 New High Qualcomm QCOM, +1.30% notched a two-year high Monday on nearly twice average volume. Look for the shares to draw buy interest on pullbacks to initial support at $64.75. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Gevity HR GVHR $28.58 $28.11 New High Originally profiled in The Technical Indicator March 11, Gevity HR GVHR has since returned as much as 20.6 percent. Nonetheless, Gevity remains well positioned barring a break back below the former March high at $28.11. Note the recent move higher has occurred on above average volume. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance New Century Financial NCEN $46.50 $44.20 $48.00 Through the broad markets' recent rally, New Century Financial NCEN, -40.00% has traded lower. Last week, it took out its 50-day moving average on a surge in volume. The near-term outlook will favor further downside until it reclaims that 50-day moving average at $48.00. Note the shares have limited secondary support if the initial floor at $44.20 is violated. Company/Index Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Retail Index RLX 396.83 380 396 While the broad markets attempt to repair recent technical damage, the Retail Index is within striking distance of new highs.

So, after a year of mostly higher prices, the stock market is finally showing signs of strain. Since its January 26 peak, the Nasdaq's declined about 11 percent but considering the rise since last year's March lows, the investment advisors believe the pullback is not excessive. Most top performing newsletter editors agree that although the current market selling has yet to run its course, this pullback is only a correction within the confines of an ongoing bull market. Eric Dany, editor Stock Prospector is expecting the economy to remain strong and continue to strengthen over the balance of the year. Profitable Investing's editor Richard Band mentioned in his recent commentary, ""All my key indicators suggest that we've only seen a minor pullback within a major bull market. Once the bottom is complete (probably within the next week or two), we'll be streaming toward new recovery highs on all broad market indexes."" Select Investor is cautiously speculating, ""There are no signs that a period of strong growth is on the way, but all indications are that we can expect continued slow, steady improvement in the economy. This may be enough to support a modest rally in March."" As the U.S. market continues its correction and politicians debate the prospects for the U.S. economy, it's comforting to note that the newsletter industry still has such a positive outlook for the remainder of the year. -- M. Bobby Syed Order: HFD Newsletter Performance Profiles Hats off Biotech investors should take note: Dr. Mark McClellan, who led sweeping reforms as head of the Food and Drug Administration, has just been named to oversee Medicare. Medical Technology Stock Letter (MTSL) summarizes McClellan's year-and-a-half tenure at the FDA as having been marked by key reforms such as streamlining the drug development and approval process, in particular, and reorganizing the massive bureaucracy in general. This led to accelerated review periods for priority treatments, such as new drug therapeutics for cancer, and a steady stream of new drug approvals. Prior to McClellan's appointment as FDA commissioner, the FDA was suffering from a bureaucratic malaise. MTSL describes the FDA during that period as ""a ship that was on the wrong course."" Under an interim appointee, the FDA had declined to approve a record number of drug treatments and had significantly extended the review periods of a number of other drugs. This led to a great deal of anxiety both among drug companies and their investors. While MTSL retains some skepticism that the FDA will continue in its new direction, it believes that ""it should be a significantly easier task to keep the FDA on course than it was to turn the FDA around."" Now, of course, McClellan has the chance to leave his intellectual imprint upon the other lumbering behemoth of American medicine, the Medicare administration. This one appointee's reforms could have implications for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors for years to come. ""Longer-term, Dr. McClellan may have a larger impact on healthcare as Medicare provides a bigger stage for his philosophies,"" comments MTSL, ""One of these is near and dear to the hearts of biotech investors -- the economic benefits of innovation."" The Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked the Medical Technology Stock Letter since the beginning of 1985.

CHICAGO (CBS.MW) -- Stocks posted a positive open Tuesday behind modest gains in European markets. The positive bias follows a volatile session Monday that ended with sizeable losses. The Dow dropped 122 points, while the S&P 500 posted a 14-point single day loss. That left the Nasdaq as the session's big percentage loser sliding nearly 31 points on the day. By the end of the session, the major U.S. averages had each touched new three-month lows. This first chart is a 15-minute chart of the Nasdaq that illustrates the past five sessions. The most obvious take away on this time frame is the recent price action has been erratic. Note that three of the Nasdaq's past four opens have resulted in a gap on the chart. Monday, the index gapped lower by 11 points off the open only to fall another 31 points intraday. Nonetheless, the index found support just under 1,900 before lifting to close at 1,909. This second chart is an hourly chart of the Nasdaq that widens the view to the prior 10 sessions. Recall that exactly one week ago -- in the Tuesday review -- the stage appeared set for a corrective bounce. The index had posted consecutive closes under its 20-day Bollinger bands generating a near-term oversold condition. As the chart above illustrates, the index did indeed experience a corrective bounce last Wednesday. It then pulled back to fill the gap Thursday lifting from support just under 1,950. So through Thursday, the Nasdaq's ""corrective bounce"" scenario remained comfortably intact. Nonetheless, Friday the index closed on its session low setting the stage for pronounced weakness Monday. In retrospect, last week's lift was indeed reflexive, lacking the conviction to trigger a sustainable uptrend. Note that Monday's biggest technical development occurred on the daily time frame. The Nasdaq edged within 11 points of its 200-day simple moving average (SMA) before lifting modestly to close at 1,909. That major moving average (illustrated in blue) sets the longer-term trend, and a sustained break lower could mark the beginning of a pronounced downtrend. Nonetheless, over the near-term the proximity of that 200-day moving average has created a favorable risk/reward scenario. Because you would normally expect that 200-day SMA to hold on the first test, the downside on new long positions should be capped. This means the aggressive trader will want to favor long positions with the notion of setting a strict stop at that 200-day moving average of 1,887. Just to be clear, the Nasdaq would need to reestablish a posture back above its 50-day simple moving average (SMA) at 2,044 for the current bounce -- assuming it even materializes -- to alter the intermediate-term consolidative tone. So pending the Nasdaq's response to its 50-day moving average, the current technical outlook could be characterized as a bullish near-term bias within the context of a broader downtrend. Tuesday's watch list The charts below identify several names worth watching from a technical perspective. These are intended as radar screen names -- sectors or stocks that appear well positioned for a potential move in the specified direction over the near term. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance MicroStrategy MSTR $47.60 $45.50 $49.46 Profiled as a short candidate in The Technical Indicator Monday, MicroStrategy MSTR, +1.01% was the Nasdaq's fourth leading point loser. The move occurred on nearly three times average volume. Despite Monday's 6.6 percent loss, MicroStrategy will remain vulnerable to further downside barring a break above its 200-day moving average at $49.46. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Microsoft MSFT $24.50 $23.60 $25.00 Microsoft MSFT, +2.10% has led both the Nasdaq's and the Dow's recent slide moving to a 10-month low Monday. Last week, it broke support at $25.00 and has since extended its losses on increased volume. Continue to look for sell pressure as the shares retest $25.00 from underneath. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance General Electric GE $29.41 $28.00 $30.27 Profiled in The Technical Indicator on March 10, General Electric GE, -1.46% still looks prone to further downside. Monday, the shares violated their 200-day moving average on twice normal volume. Initial support at $28.00 matches the October low. Note that its recent downturn has been driven by an extended surge in volume. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance TASER International TASR $62.45 $58.00 $64.00 Originally profiled in The Technical Indicator on Friday March 19, Taser International TASR remains well situated to break higher. Monday it was the Nasdaq's fourth leading point gainer. Note the shares have trended closely from their 20-day moving average. Each pullback to that near-term moving average has been regarded as a buying opportunity. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Eon Labs ELAB $60.96 $57.55 $63.19 Eon Labs ELAB, +0.00% approached all-time highs Monday despite considerable broad market weakness. The move followed a successful test of its 50-day moving average and occurred on strong volume. The near-term outlook would improve further on a break above resistance at the February high of $63.19. Company Symbol Mon Close Support Resistance Oncolytics Biotech ONCY $5.18 $5.00 $5.45 Oncolytics Biotech ONCY is another name well positioned to rise. The shares approached 52-week highs Monday after carving out a sizeable five-month base. Initial support around $5.00 represents the breakout point.

AAXN,"CHICAGO (CBS.MW) - Shares of Taser International fell Tuesday following an early bounce on the maker of stun guns' report of an enormous rise in fourth-quarter earnings -- and a 2004 profit forecast well above Wall Street's wildest hopes. Taser hit a $52 week high of $154.06 but ran out juice and closed down almost 6 percent at $127.34. Still, the company -- which expects about $49 million in revenues this year -- ended the day with a market cap of $408 million. Before the bell, Scottsdale, Ariz.-based Taser posted earnings of $2.8 million, or 56 cents a share, for the fourth quarter. That is up from $67,498 and 2 cents a share a year ago, handily over the average estimate (of two) analysts polled by Reuters Research. It's also a tad higher than the company's total sales for the last three months of 2002. Sales better than tripled to $10.8 million, also higher than the Street view. Looking ahead, Taser TASR said it expects sales to come in at $49 million this year, double the 2003 number. The company's eponymous products are used by some law enforcement agencies to subdue citizens at non-contact range without resorting to the use of a firearm. Tasers use compressed nitrogen to fire probes -- connected by wire to a handheld unit -- that shock the target with high-voltage electrical impulses. An atmosphere of heightened security and growing public concern over fatal shootings by police officers has helped the company grow at an exponential rate. ""Since the introduction of our weapons to the law enforcement community in late 1999, we have seen our penetration climb from zero to 24 percent of U.S. policing agencies,"" said CEO Rick Smith in the earnings release. Yet, the company has ""only penetrated 5.2 percent of the available market of individual officers ...leaving significant room for continued growth in the domestic markets in the years ahead."" Taser is also rolling out a scaled-down version -- the X26 Personal Defense System -- targeted at the civilian market this summer. The product is currently legal to possess in all but a handful of U.S. states. The company's stock has appreciated dramatically over the last year, climbing from a low of under four bucks in Feb. of 2003.

AAXN,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Shares of Taser International closed at a record high Wednesday after the maker of stun guns declared a three-for-one stock split. The shares rose $14.50, or 14.3 percent, to $115.75, in their heaviest trading since Taser went public three years ago. The stock split is payable Feb. 10 to shareholders of record as of Jan. 26. The move will increase Taser's outstanding stock to 12.67 million shares from 4.22 million shares, the Scottsdale, Ariz.-based company TASR said. Amid heightened security awareness and public outcry over shooting deaths, law enforcement and security companies are increasingly opting to use high-voltage slugs that can flatten attackers without causing permanent injury. Orders have sent profits into the black, and the company's stock is up threefold since mid-October. ""We've been saying for a long time that (the split) was needed,"" said Steven Gish, analyst at Roth Capital Partners in Newport Beach, Calif. ""For investors, it's a very positive sign that liquidity is available."" With members of the founding Smith family and company employees holding on to more than 1 million shares, the price of Taser's 3 million actively traded shares may have been too expensive for some small-scale investors, analysts said. And large-scale stockholders have encountered difficulty breaking up large blocks of shares to sell in smaller quantities, said Joe Blankenship, an analyst with Source One Capital in Scottsdale. Though Taser executives had broadly hinted to analysts and investors that the company's board would approve splitting the stock, neither the terms nor timing had been determined until Wednesday's announcement. The three-for-one split will provide more trading liquidity than some investors had expected, Gish and Blankenship said. Though splits typically make stocks more easily tradable, the short-term boost they provide isn't always sustained or deserved, Gish said. ""In this case, it's probably deserved, because it can open up the market considerably,"" he said. Law enforcement fuels sales, profit Last year, the Scottsdale, Ariz., company added police departments in Cincinnati, Kansas City and Charlotte, N.C., to its client list. A $1-million allocation from Congress allowed the U.S. Defense Department to send several dozen Taser guns to Iraq. The company is now waiting to fill a $3.5-million order from the United Arab Emirates. Sales tripled to $6.1 million in the third quarter from $1.9 million a year earlier, bringing the company a $1.1 million profit. Taser probably sold $6.3 million in the quarter just ended, according to a First Call survey of analysts. Taser has mainly pushed sales to military and law enforcement, but at the Las Vegas Consumer Electronics Show last week it displayed a new stun gun it plans to introduce for individual consumers. ""We're not going to do it until they see more police carrying it on their hips,"" Chairman Phil Smith said. ""I see that as a couple of years from now."" The improving results and outlook have sent the stock up 25-fold in 12 months, faster than most analysts can revise their price targets. Gish said he planned to adjust his target of $60, but wondered whether the company's projected sales and profit justify the stock's triple-digit price. ""It's getting expensive,"" Gish said. Analysts expect the company's shares to earn a split-adjusted $1.23 apiece next year, according to Thomson First Call. The resulting price-earnings ratio of 93 is one of the highest on Wall Street. The stock has also become a darling of short sellers, investors who seek to profit by betting a stock's price will decline. Such investors sell borrowed shares, hoping to repay the lender after buying shares more cheaply. As of Dec. 8, short positions amounted to 52 percent of the stock's actively traded shares, according to Multex data, compared with 14 percent for hot biotech stock ImClone Systems IMCL, +6.11% and 2 percent for software giant Microsoft MSFT, +2.10% More from MarketWatch Why It Feels Like Facebook Is Listening Through Your Mic More Coverage Three reasons the stock market’s fundamentals look solid Stephen Hawking’s final Reddit post is going viral over its ominous warning about robots Trump boasts about making up facts about trade deficit to Trudeau","Jan 14, 2004 4:33 p.m. ET",1,Taser shares soar on word of three-for-one stock split,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/taser-shares-soar-on-word-of-three-for-one-stock-split

AAXN,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Made it -- briefly. But investment letter reaction to Dow 10,000 is very mixed. Writing early Tuesday, superbear Richard Russell of Dow Theory Letters seemed to dismiss the whole subject: ""For instance, every bull and every stockholder wants the Dow to close over 10,000. Why? Well, because 10,000 means and certainly feels like progress. A Dow over 10,000 just feels bullish, and why argue with that."" Russell has been treating the rally with respect. But after the close, he wrote: ""TODAY'S MARKET ACTION -- Not good. The Dow gave us a key reversal -- new high and then closing lower on rising volume... It's a bit early to jump to conclusions, but I haven't liked the market action the last few days. There's been an amazing amount of complacency, along with gathering optimism. The Transport's lack of confirmation [See my Dec. 8 column] has been completely ignored, and as has been the lack of volume on the most recent rise."" Peter Eliades of Stock Market Cycles put out a comment not unreasonably congratulating himselves (Eliades favors the Royal Plural): ""In the Barron's issue dated March 22nd, 1999, we wrote an article which they entitled ""Nasty Numbers."" The subtitle was ""Will the curse of Dow 100 and 1000 be revisited on 10,000?""...The first two sentences of the article proclaimed: ""So the Dow finally, if briefly, touched 10,000 last week. Investors should celebrate now, because they may not get another chance to do so for a decade or more."" In three more months, it will have been 4 years since that article was written and despite the ridicule that we had to face at the time the article was written, it looks more and more like the article could prove to have been quite prescient..."" Eliades says his esoteric numerological ""price projection technique"" now makes him think the Dow will probably be unsuccessful in overcoming 10,000. Tuesday night, he noted in his hotline that his ""Stock-index futures traders"" should now be shorting S&P futures as of the moment the Dow breached 10,000. He added: ""Exit that position tomorrow only if the Dow Jones Industrial Average moves above an intraday print of 10,040."" But the bulls are not impressed by the reversal. Todd Market Forecast said: ""There is currently a split market. The Nasdaq has essentially been retreating for the six sessions since the peak on Dec. 1st while the Dow has been going higher. The S&P has been sideways to down. The Nasdaq could be telling us something, but we doubt it."" Todd is currently buying stocks and bonds, neutral on gold. The Cabot Market Letter interests me particularly because it is one of the ""geezers"" - my name for letters that were around at the last bear market climax in 1974. It has been bullish for more than a year. In Tuesday night's hotline, Cabot contrasted the jubilant atmosphere when the Dow DJIA, +1.07% first exceed 10,000 with today's restraint and wrote: ""In general, we see the lack of out-and-out enthusiasm as a positive sign for the market over the longer-term. So you should remain bullish, though you shouldn't hesitate to ditch a stock if it's showing clear signs of weakness."" As of last night, Cabot recommended these buys: John B.

AAXN,"SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Still a fledgling mutual fund, Touchstone Small-Cap Growth has stepped to the front of the class with strong gains. Up 55 percent since its October 2002 launch, the $35 million portfolio TESAX ranks in the top 10 percent of small-capitalization growth stock funds over the past 12 months, reports fund data firm Lipper. Co-manager Tom Barry looks for that performance to continue. He runs 30 percent of the fund, focusing on microcap stocks, and Robert Davidson, chief investment officer of Boston's Longwood Investment Advisors, picks small-cap shares for the remaining 70 percent of the fund. ""All the ingredients for a continuation of this small-cap rally are in place. This should last for some time,"" said Barry, who is also chief investment officer of Bjurman, Barry & Associates in Los Angeles. The Touchstone Fund carries a 5.75 percent front-end load. Barry screens for fast-growing companies with low valuations that exceed financial targets. He acknowledged that any investor can pick stocks this way, but intuition is also a factor in determining what to buy and what to avoid. That and knowing when to sell. ""You have to have the attitude that you don't care if you make a mistake,"" Barry said. ""Sell your losers and sell them quick. Many people make this mistake, particularly during an up market. It's an insurance policy against quadrupling your losses."" One of Barry's favorites is Taser TASR a maker of ""less-than-lethal"" weapons used by police departments and correctional facilities. Taser's share price has soared this year to more than $60 from $5, but so have earnings and revenues, Barry said. Taser rose $6.83, or 12 percent, on Wednesday to close at $64.63. Barry also likes another high-flyer: OmniVision Technologies OVTI, +1.49% a maker of chips used to read images, such as those in digital cameras. This stock has quadrupled this year to around $60 and trades at 60 times projected 2004 earnings, but Barry points to expanding demand and increasing earnings. Both earnings and revenue are expected to grow 100 percent in 2004. On Wednesday, OmniVision shares rose $10.77, or 22 percent, to close at $59.14, after the company raised quarterly earnings guidance. Nam Tai Electronics NTE, +2.94% a contract manufacturer and services provider to telecom and consumer electronics companies, is another company Barry likes partly because of its involvement with digital cameras. The firm declared a 10 percent stock dividend last week at the same time it announced third-quarter earnings growth of 39 percent and sales growth of 64 percent.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- Taser International is firing on all cylinders. The maker of stun guns has seen its stock price triple over the past year, won several orders from airlines for its high-tech weaponry in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist skyjackings and is set to reap the rewards from an upcoming decision that may allow airlines to arm their pilots with stun guns. But for all the positives, is it a one-trick pony whose lofty stock price will crash once terrorism fears dissipate and it stops being the flavor of the month? Company officials and analysts don't think so. ""I like the sector and I like the stock,"" said Steven Gish, analyst at Roth Capital Partners. ""From a long-term perspective, it's relying on the law enforcement business and the consumer business, which is a sleeping giant."" Even before Taser became a hot security play in the aftermath of the Sept 11 attacks, the company was on track for another quarter of record sales, thanks to booming demand from police departments for the non-lethal weapons, which emit electrical charges to disable attackers. ""Obviously 9-11 adds a new dimension, bringing airlines into the picture. But they were already on an impressive growth path before that through the law enforcement side,"" said Richard Ryan, analyst at Dougherty & Company. ""9-11 added to it, but it already was a pretty good growth story."" One hundred percent growth to be exact. Spurred on by demand for its key Advanced Taser product, the company reported a doubling of revenues from year-ago levels to a record $2.4 million in the first quarter. For 2002, the company expects revenues of $12 million and earnings of 50 cents per basic share. What's the big deal? Taser TASR chairman Phillips Smith acknowledges the lift that the debate over airline security has given to the stock, but says that the issue has overshadowed growth for its more important law enforcement and consumer businesses. ""We're trying to create a market on the law enforcement side and the airline sector is just icing on the cake."" Taser chairman Phillips Smith ""Only 2 percent of business comes from airlines, most comes from law enforcement,"" he said in an interview with He conceded the public debate over cockpit security is helpful. ""It's (airlines) not a huge market, but it gives you visibility in the consumer market,"" said Smith. But it's a business that could grow dramatically if the U.S. Transportation Department gives the go-ahead for pilots to carry stun-guns to protect their planes - a decision which could come by the end of June or early July at the latest. There's a high likelihood that will happen, give the fact that the government has already turned down an idea to allow pilots to carry guns on board. ""The smart money says it's going to happen but there's no guarantee,"" he said. If it does, the surge in orders could mean an additional $3-4 million in sales -- a nice chunk of change for a company, which came to market barely two years ago. Several major airlines have already bought the Taser, but the biggest order so far has come from United Airlines UAL, +2.30% which purchased the contraption -- which is no bigger than a cell phone -- for each of its 500 planes. ""We're trying to create a market on the law enforcement side and the airline sector is just icing on the cake,"" he said. Ryan, who gave the stock a ""buy"" rating with a $23 price target, said he hasn't upgraded his financial expectations based on a possible flood of airline orders. ""It's important from a PR stance, but I'm not buying the stock hoping that the government will approve the use of Tasers,"" said Ryan, who expects the company to make 34 cents per share this year and 77 cents the next. Instead, Ryan and other analysts are betting that demand for the non-lethal weapons will grow as more states legalize the weapons and police departments adopt them as a crucial tool to subdue suspects without deadly force. In addition, ""the consumer market is opening up,"" said Ryan. Already, 43 states have legalized Tasers, which can be bought over the Internet though they are most widely sold through gun shops. Some controversy Use of Tasers hasn't come without controversy. Company officials firmly deny any linkage between the Taser and the recent deaths of three drug-related suspects who were zapped while in police custody. ""Unfortunately, there's a tendency for people to rush to conclusions in these cases,"" said CEO Smith. ""Every year approximately 12,000 people die as a result of drug overdoses in the U.S... If someone is in the throes of a drug overdose, the application of the Taser will not stop (or exacerbate) the ongoing chemical reactions that will lead to the eventual death of the subject."" Tasers fire two probes up to 15 feet, with strong electrical charges that penetrate the nervous system immediately, knocking people out. They are considered more effective than guns because they work no matter where the probes hit one's body. Reflecting the company's hope of drumming up more law-enforcement business, Taser recently named high-profile former New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik to its board. Kerik, with his crime-fighting credentials burnished by his performance during the terrorist attacks, will help the company with introductions and personal contacts, said Smith. ""Fifteen hundred police departments already have them, and we're seeing a quarterly growth rate of 20 percent in the law enforcement market,"" said Smith. Analyst Gish likes Taser for other reasons as well. The company doesn't have to worry about a massive dump of its shares as its holdings come mainly from retail investors. Moreover, Taser has recently introduced a new line of products and is seeking to diversify its business. That said, Gish admits Taser may be lofty at current levels, pegging the stock at a ""long-term buy"" with a price target of $19.10. ""The stock would look attractive if the price pulls back,"" he said. Taser's share price surged to over $21 in April, helped by the controversy over the pilot controversy as well as general investor enthusiasm for companies that churn out security-related products. It has fallen back since then, ending Tuesday trade at $14.86, but still up almost three-fold from a 52-week low of $5.35 set last June. Smith acknowledges the criticism that its stock is pricey relative to the market, but thinks that's not unusual given the young company's fast-growth spurt. ""It's not a P/E story,"" he said. ""We're typical of many early-stage companies that should be considered based on our revenues, except that we're also cash-flow positive,"" he said. ""We're trying to grow 100 percent a year.""

AAXN,"WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- The Bush administration won't permit commercial pilots to carry handguns to deter potential hijackers, a senior administration official told lawmakers Tuesday. ""I will not permit firearms in the cockpit,"" said John Magaw, undersecretary for the Transportation Security Administration, who is charged with making U.S. airports safe following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. ""Pilots need to concentrate on flying the plane."" At a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on aviation security, Magaw stressed that federal air marshals should be the only armed passengers aboard airplanes. ""They will do whatever they have to -- to the point of giving up their own life -- to make sure that that cockpit stays safe,"" he told lawmakers. Magaw said TSA is still weighing whether pilots should arm themselves with electric stun guns. He further suggested other security measures, such as special video cameras, could help pilots. Both Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta, who also testified at Tuesday's hearing, and Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge have expressed opposition to arming pilots. A formal announcement will be made sometime this week, Magaw told lawmakers. Airline trade groups and pilots blasted the decision. ""All that pilots have to prevent the plane from being turned into a cruise missile is a crash ax, a flashlight and a flight manual,"" said David Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association. Capt. Duane Woerth, president of the Air Line Pilots Association, said government officials would rather send military jets to shoot down a hijacked plane rather than ""give pilots a last chance to prevent such a tragedy."" After terrorists used four commercial airliners as suicide bombs to crash into the World Trade Center and Pentagon, new aviation security laws were enacted last November that require secure doors on cockpits and armed sky marshals on planes to help prevent similar tragedies. And the subject of arming pilots has been the subject of much debate since the Sept 11 attacks. Legislation is pending in Senate and House panels to allow pilots to carry weapons. The House Aviation Subcommittee is scheduled to vote May 23 on a bill that would create a government program to selectively train and arm pilots. Last November, United Airlines began stocking its cockpits with stun guns from Taser International TASR The nonlethal weapons emit electronic discharges designed to temporarily disable attackers. At Tuesday's hearing, Sen. Conrad Burns, R-Mont., co-author of proposed legislation to let pilots brandish firearms, also urged U.S. transportation officials to reconsider their position.

Simplex Solutions SPLX, +2.26% fell almost 23 percent after the Sunnyvale, Calif., integrated circuits firm forecast that it will break even on a pro forma basis in the first quarter on revenue of $11 million to $11.1 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call were looking for a profit of 3 cents a share in the period. ""Customers were cautious about committing additional dollars for the purchase of software and services as a result of the slowdown in the semiconductor industry and the economy,"" said Penny Herscher, the company's chairman and CEO, in a press release. 1-800-Flowers.com FLWS, -0.42% sank nearly 16 percent after the Westbury, N.Y., firm said that Benchmark Capital has distributed roughly 5 million shares of its common stock to its limited and general partners. This distribution, which increases the market float of 1-800-Flowers.com common stock to about 19 million shares, represents Benchmark's entire investment in the company. ValiCert VLCT dropped almost 10 percent after the company warned that fourth-quarter revenue would fall short of expectations as ""difficult economic conditions"" led to the delay of closing several large orders, and will lead to further cost cutting initiatives. Losses for the period, however, are expected to be less than expected. For the quarter ending in December, the provider of electronic business management said sales should be $6.2 million, below previous expectations of $7.6 million. Losses however, will be $3.7 million to $3.8 million, or 16 cents a share, less than the previous forecast of $3.9 million, or 17 cents a share. ValiCert added that it would implement a 20 percent reduction of its work force and consolidate its operating facilities. Vina Technologies VINA tumbled almost 17 percent after the broadband telecom company said it expects a fourth-quarter loss of 11 cents to 13 cents a share, excluding one-time items, while analysts were polled by First Call had been expecting a 10-cent loss. Revenue will run between $10.8 million and $11 million, according to the company. The company said the revised estimates are due to a temporary suspension in the deployment of its central office product, the MBX. Western Wireless WWCA slumped nearly 23 percent after the Bellevue, Wash., communication services firm said it expects EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) of between $73 million and $75 million in the fourth quarter. Service revenue for the period is pegged between $208 million and $211 million. For the year, Western Wireless sees EBITDA of $344 million and $346 million, and service revenue of $874 million and $877 million. Net subscriber additions for the quarter totaled 19,000, with an average monthly churn rate of 2.3 percent. The company said that fourth-quarter roaming minutes from its partners came in below expectations due to a slowdown in travel nationwide. Western Wireless is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 26. Analysts polled by Thomson Financial/First Call are looking for a loss of 69 cents a share on revenue of $317.7 million in the period, on average.

AAXN,"NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- While the futures markets weighed whether a planned production cut by OPEC will come to pass Jan. 1, crude futures closed under $18 a barrel Thursday for the first time in 29 months. On Wednesday, OPEC members had confirmed their agreement to cut their production quota by 1.5 million barrels per day to 21.7 million barrels in the new year. But the cartel said the cut would be conditioned on a 500,000-barrel-per-day cut by oil producers that are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, casting doubt on whether any price-boosting plan will be put into effect at all.

And those cutbacks have ended, at least for now, the Wall Street career of noted Net-stock analyst Henry Blodget. The 35-year-old Blodget, who made his name with an audacious but market-moving forecast for shares of Amazon.com AMZN, +1.11% and other Web high fliers, is leaving Merrill with a good deal of tarnish on his name. Critics fault him for remaining officially optimistic about stocks even as they spiraled southward in 2000 and 2001. Blodget told CBS.MarketWatch.com that he plans to focus his efforts on a book that's been in the works for two years. And, according to a published report, he leaves Merrill Lynch MER, -2.35% with a $2 million severance package. See full story. Cars drive October's retail sales WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Financing incentives and deep discounting led to a surge in auto purchases in October and sent overall U.S. retail sales up sharply. Retail sales rose 7.1 percent in October, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday, dramatically ahead of the 3.2 percent rise expected by economists polled by CBS.MarketWatch.com. October's was the largest monthly rise since the current data series was launched in 1992. See full story. A stunning development at UAL CHICAGO (CBS.MW) -- United Airlines is striking back. Aiming to address concerns about how easily hijackers broke into cockpits to perpetrate September's terrorist attacks, United proposed Thursday to arm pilots with stun guns.

Philip Morris thinks it knows what's in a name NEW YORK (CBS.MW) -- You've come a long way, baby. Looking to reshape its image, Philip Morris MO, -0.21% proposed to change its corporate name to Altria Group, although its tobacco, food and beer operating units would retain their current monikers. According to Geoffrey Bible, Philip Morris' chief executive, the change results from a ""need for clarity"" since the corporate parent currently shares the same name as two of its tobacco units. Also, ""we are not the same family of companies we were just a few years ago. The Nabisco acquisition and the Kraft initial public offering are the most recent evidence of our growth and evolution,"" said Bible. See full story. Frequent fliers who want airport shortcuts WASHINGTON (CBS.MW) -- Business travelers are giving a thumbs-up to Congress' airline security package, but road warriors are still asking for more. An overwhelming majority of MarketWatch.com readers who responded to a recent poll support the idea of implementing a travelers' ID system that would allow frequent fliers to bypass long security-checkpoint lines. Only 14 of more than 600 respondents to the unscientific poll opposed the concept of the voluntary pre-screening system, which was recently recommended by a Transportation Department task force.

Family-oriented movies are flourishing because movies that reinforce old-fashioned societal values have a higher place in pop culture than ever. See commentary by Jon Friedman Commentary: Cause for celebration SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- The U.S. response to the September terror attacks has been swift. It has been unmerciful where the Taliban is concerned. And it has been extremely successful within a remarkably short time, giving the U.S. and its allies just cause for celebration. If the economic and financial impact of Sept. 11 proves to be commensurate with the nature and speed of our response to it, as I suggested a day after the attacks (see archived Erdman's World), then as a result of what has happened this week the economic clouds caused by that attack should lift much earlier than even the most optimistic among us could have realistically hoped just a few weeks ago See commentary by Paul Erdman. Commentary: Bears are on the run SAN FRANCISCO (CBS.MW) -- Like the Taliban fleeing before U.S. and Northern Alliance forces, the bears on Wall Street are now on the run from a relentless eight-week-long stock-market rise. Market bulls, and many regular people, people are preparing for the recovery stage in the economy. But the bears aren't convinced the rally is sustainable, and they're lining up to profit from the market's next blow-off. The word among the bears is that any rally that results from more good news from Afghanistan, such as the capture of Osama bin Laden or the fall of Kandahar, will be the trigger to start selling. Both events could happen soon. But for the bears, that would be a last hurrah. See commentary by David Callaway.

AAXN,"CHICAGO (CBS.MW) -- In a bold move to secure cockpits, United Airlines said Thursday it aims to arm all of its pilots with immobilizing stun guns. The news fueled shares of the carrier, of other airline-industry players and of the Taser stun gun's manufacturer, Taser International, in heavy volume. UAL Corp. UAL, +2.30% jumped nearly 7 percent, or 82 cents, to close at $12.71. The industry's main yardstick, the Amex Airline Index ($XAL), extended its three-day rally to 75.71, up 3.98 points, or 5.5 percent. But it was Taser International TASR that got the biggest bang from the news. Taser said it could generate between $700,000 and $800,000 in sales on the United deal. Its shares reached new highs while soaring nearly 23 percent, or $2.35, to $13.16 (see chart below). United said it will place the Tasers -- each is a little bigger than a cell phone -- in lock boxes on all 500 of its planes ""very shortly,"" according to spokesman Andy Plews. Tasers fire two probes up to 15 feet, with strong electrical charges that penetrate the nervous system immediately, knocking people out. They are considered more effective than guns because they work no matter where the probes hit one's body. Taser International claims no one has ever died or suffered a long-term injury from the weapon. Surprisingly, the only maintenance required is a 9-volt battery. ""Tasers will incapacitate an attacker without endangering the airplane,"" said UAL's chief operation officer, Andrew Studdert. An errant bullet from a handgun could pierce a jet's hull and depressurize the cabin. The Air Line Pilots Association praised the United move. ""If the bad guys get on the airplanes, you want to keep them out of the cockpits,"" said Herb Hunter, a captain for United and an ALPA spokesman. ""But if they get in the cockpits, we have to have some method of defending ourselves and the planes. ""Is it a cure-all or is it perfect? No, but this is a good first step,"" he added. Hear Captain Hunter talk about Tasers. United is the first major airline to take such a significant step in onboard security. Last month, Mesa Air Group MESA began training its pilots to carry Tasers. ""This is an important step in thwarting any potential hijacking attempt,"" United's Plews said. Yet the Taser plan still needs the assent of the Federal Aviation Administration or Congress. FAA rules prohibit use of a gun of any kind aboard jetliners. Sky marshals are specifically allowed to carry weapons. ""We'll review the United proposal without making any commitment either way,"" said FAA spokesman Paul Takemoto. Approval currently looks unlikely. The FAA turned down the Mesa proposal. United also said Thursday that it is initiating fresh security training procedures for its flight attendants, who have complained about not having been given new directions since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. Plews would not reveal what measures United will enact for flight attendants because, he said, terrorists would then find out as well. ""Training that addresses the new world since Sept. 11 will begin shortly,"" he said.

AAXN,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon AAXN, +3.67% the global leader in public safety technology, today announced a ten-year CEO performance award for CEO and founder Rick Smith tied entirely to achieving market cap and financial performance milestones that would make Axon one of the most valuable companies in the public safety sector. For the award to fully vest, Axon's market cap would have to grow ten-fold from recent levels to $13.5 billion, and key revenue and profitability goals would also have to be achieved. The award is modeled after the recently announced 2018 Tesla CEO compensation plan for Elon Musk, which the New York Times described as ""about as friendly to shareholders as they come."" Under this performance award, Rick will only be compensated if Axon generates extraordinary shareholder value. He will not receive a salary or cash bonus, nor any new equity compensation that vests automatically with the passage of time. ""Today's announcement bolsters Axon's bold ten-year vision for growth, innovation, and social change with a compensation plan that inspires and motivates,"" said Hadi Partovi, Axon Board member and CEO of Code.org. ""In every technology company I've backed, the long-term vision and drive of the founder/CEO has played a critical role. Axon's plan ensures that Rick is fully committed for the long haul, with outstanding incentives to deliver outstanding results."" CEO Performance Award Details The performance award consists of a ten-year grant of stock options that vests in 12 tranches. Each of the 12 tranches vests only if a pair of milestones are both met. Market Cap Milestones: The first set of milestones are based on Axon's six-month average market cap with the first milestone at $2.5 billion, nearly double the average today. For each of the remaining eleven milestones, Axon's market cap must continue to increase in $1 billion increments. For the full award to vest, Axon's market cap must increase to $13.5 billion - more than ten times the company's market cap today using the same six-month average. Financial Performance Milestones: To meet the financial performance milestones, Axon must achieve a set of escalating revenue or adjusted EBITDA targets chosen to motivate top-line and bottom-line operational rigor. Revenue milestones start at approximately two times current levels and adjusted EBITDA milestones start at approximately three times current levels. (The revenue and EBITDA targets aren't matched to each other. This structure ensures a focus on proving the profitability of new lines of business while not becoming a constraint against investment flexibility in the long run.)   By combining market cap, revenue, and EBITDA milestones, Rick is motivated to generate long-term value for shareholders through delivering operational results, without incentives to engage in short-term measures. For each of the 12 tranches that is achieved, Rick will vest in 538,488 stock option shares (corresponding to 1% of Axon's current outstanding shares). If none of the market cap or financial performance objectives are achieved, Rick will receive no compensation. Leading Axon's Mission to Protect Life While Driving Growth and Profitability Rick has been instrumental to Axon's market leadership in less lethal weapons, body cameras, and evidence management software. Axon has an even bolder vision for the next ten years: to make the bullet obsolete, and to enhance transparency in our justice systems ensuring fair, effective justice for all. Our weapons have saved 196,000 lives and are broadly used by law enforcement worldwide. Rick's personal goal is to launch a TASER weapon that can outperform a lethal handgun within the next decade, offering a new solution to the problems of gun violence, which are painfully highlighted by recent events. Our wearable cameras and cloud services have transformed public safety, bringing the light of transparency to corners of society where brave men and women confront dangers most of us never see. We plan to revolutionize this sector further with artificial intelligence technology to help law enforcement save time and save lives. Rick remains Axon's largest individual shareholder, and today's award (which is contingent on his continued leadership) ensures his commitment and focus on delivering on a ten-year vision that can increase shareholder value. Modeled After the 2018 Tesla CEO Compensation Plan Upon reviewing the recently-announced Tesla CEO compensation plan, the Axon Board was impressed with the design of the plan to maximize alignment with shareholders while accounting for future unforeseen events. The Tesla plan stood out because it represents 100% pay-for-performance, motivates a long-term commitment, and aligns CEO compensation with value creation for all stakeholders, including employees, customers and shareholders. Consequently, the Axon Board has mindfully endeavored to mirror the Tesla plan with deviations only where it felt Axon's circumstances are different. Rick's performance award is structurally similar to the Tesla plan, with numbers adjusted for Axon's scale, business model, and objectives. Axon's Compensation Committee engaged Compensia Inc., Aon Equity Services and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati — the same external compensation and legal experts who assisted Tesla in creating its plan, as well as the law firm of Snell & Wilmer. Readers will note this press release, and the upcoming proxy statement, are similar in format to the Tesla plan documentation. This is intentional, to help any shareholders, analysts and other parties who have invested time to understand Elon Musk's plan to more easily understand the Axon CEO award. Upcoming Shareholder Vote The Board granted this award to Rick on February 26, 2018 with Rick recusing himself, and its effectiveness is subject to the approval of Axon's shareholders, who will vote on it at the Axon Annual Stockholder meeting on May 24. Rick Smith will also recuse himself from that vote. Any shareholder of record or beneficial owner of Axon shares as of the record date (currently projected to be March 26, 2018) will be entitled to vote their shares at the 2018 Annual Meeting and the award will only become effective if a majority of the votes cast are in favor of the proposal. Axon will release its full proxy statement providing complete details of the award along with additional materials for Axon shareholders in the next few weeks. Proxy Statement Information Axon plans to file with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the ""SEC""), and furnish to its shareholders a proxy statement in connection with the proposed CEO performance award. This proxy statement will contain important information about the proposed award and related matters. AXON SHAREHOLDERS ARE URGED TO READ THESE MATERIALS AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT AXON WILL FILE WITH THE SEC WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT AXON AND THE CEO PERFORMANCE AWARD. Shareholders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents and other documents filed with the SEC by Axon through the website maintained by the SEC at www.sec.gov. In addition, shareholders will be able to obtain free copies of these documents from Axon's Investor Relations page at http://investor.axon.com.

AAXN,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 27, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon AAXN, +3.67% the global leader in public safety technology, today released the following quarterly update letter to shareholders. Record annual revenue of $344 million, up 28% from 2016 Q4 revenue of $94.7 million, up 15% year-over-year Q4 GAAP EPS of ($0.04) includes $8 million tax reform-related charge; Non-GAAP EPS of $0.13 $82 million of cash and short-term investments and zero debt at December 31, 2017 Completed the largest ever cloud data migration, moving 20 PB of data onto Microsoft's Azure cloud Introduces 2018 financial guidance, including 16%-18% revenue growth and 300-400 basis points of operating margin expansion Dear shareholders, Today we are reporting our financial results for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2017 and we are providing our 2018 outlook. We've just completed a pivotal year where we changed our company name from TASER International to Axon Enterprise (Axon) to better reflect our go-forward mission and made significant investments to drive progress within our four strategic growth areas: 1) TASER conducted electric weapons (CEWs), 2) body-worn cameras and evidence management, 3) Axon Fleet in-car video systems, and 4) Axon Records. We also made investments in our international direct sales strategy and artificial intelligence and machine learning capabilities. We don't intend to slow down in 2018. At our Investor & Analyst day in November 2017, we laid out a financial strategy to shift to recurring cash flows, to invest in products and features that expand our total addressable market and to drive profitability through disciplined execution. This year, we plan to introduce several new products and services and improve upon our existing suite of offerings  - which we believe will grow recurring cash flows and increase average revenue per user. We're also scaling up our offices across the world and cross-pollinating our internal groups to ensure we execute against one vision for Axon. In short, we are focused on disciplined execution and preparing for significant growth across the globe. Finally, we are driving toward profitability in the Software & Sensors segment and remain committed to expanding total company operating margins, which we address in more detail below. Summary of Q4 2017 Results: Net sales increased 15% to $94.7 million in Q4 2017 compared to $82.1 million in Q4 2016. Consolidated gross margin was 66.6% in Q4 2017 compared to 55.1% in Q3 2017 and 60.6% in Q4 2016. Total operating expenses in Q4 2017 were $55.4 million, compared to $40.4 million in Q4 2016. Income from operations was $7.6 million in Q4 2017 compared to $9.4 million in Q4 2016. Operating margin in Q4 2017 was 8.1%. Our GAAP net loss for Q4 2017 was ($2.1 million), or ($0.04) per diluted share, compared to net income of $6.3 million, or $0.12 per diluted share, in Q4 2016. Non-GAAP net income for Q4 2017 was $7.1 million, or $0.13 per share, and excludes the following: For the first time this quarter, we are introducing a new non-GAAP net income that excludes stock-based compensation expenses, and we will provide that going forward. With this added adjustment, our non-GAAP net income was $9.7 million, or $0.18 per share, which compares to $8.0 million, or $0.15 per share, in Q4 2016. Adjusted EBITDA for Q4 2017 was $14.8 million compared to $13.1 million in Q4 2016. This represents 13% growth year-over-year. We calculate adjusted EBITDA by adding back or subtracting to EBITDA the following: In Q4 2017, cash provided by operating activities was $24.3 million. Cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments were $82.0 million at December 31, 2017, compared with $61.8 million at the end of Q3 2017. We executed on our stated objective of managing inventory down to below $50 million by year end. Total inventory for Q4 2017 decreased to $45.5 million from $52.7 million at the end of Q3 2017 and $60.7 million at the end of Q2 2017. TASER Weapons: TASER Weapons segment revenue increased 10% to $64.4 million in Q4 2017 compared to $58.3 million in Q4 2016 as we executed against our mission to make a TASER conducted electric weapon available to every officer. TASER Weapons segment gross margin was 70.9% in Q4 2017 compared to 69.3% in Q4 2016. The margin strength is due to favorable mix and leverage on higher revenue. In Q4 2017, approximately 38% of units ordered, including from international customers, were on the TASER 60, Officer Safety Plan, or TASER Assurance Plan payment options. This compares to the 43% of weapons sold on a payment plan in Q3 2017, which indicates our customers continued willingness to pay for weapons hardware via payment plan and supports our stated financial goal of increasing recurring cash flows. Two of our top three TASER contracts signed in Q4 2017 were procured via the TASER 60 payment plan. We're also seeing increased adoption of our TASER X2 two-shot CEW, proving that customers see value in having an immediate backup shot. Looking forward, our TASER weapons sales pipeline remains solid, reflecting continued strong demand domestically and increasing interest across international markets. We believe that continued investments in smart weapons technology and incident reporting will further enhance our value proposition over the long term. Software & Sensors: In early December 2017 we completed the migration of the U.S. instance of Evidence.com to Microsoft Azure. We announced the strategic decision to switch to Microsoft Azure in Q4 2015, with the goal of better aligning our cloud-hosted services with our customer preferences. We believe that ours was the largest application ever to migrate between two public cloud providers. Throughout the migration, we focused on the three priorities of correctness, minimal impact to customers and security. Preserving the integrity and privacy of our customers' evidence data continues to be our highest priority. Although the initiative spanned two years and thousands of hours of work, the switch on a Sunday morning in early December required only one hour of downtime and resulted in no reported application bugs, nor security or compliance issues for our customers. This smooth transition highlights our team's competence and subject matter expertise in site reliability engineering, software engineering, product management, information security, and customer support engineering. Importantly, our partnership with Microsoft is already generating positive results, helping us win several major city police agencies in the U.S. and one large international customer. The partnership will also allow us to reduce our storage and server costs going forward. We incurred a total of $0.7 million of migration and duplicate storage cost in Q4 2017 compared with our projection of $1.0 million for the quarter and our Q3 2017 incurred costs of $1.4 million. Software & Sensors segment revenue grew 27% year-over-year to $30.2 million in Q4 2017 compared to $23.7 million in Q4 2016. Software & Sensors segment gross margin was 57.3% in Q4 2017 compared to 39.4% in Q4 2016. Annual recurring service revenue grew 74% year-over-year to $70.0 million in Q4 2017 compared to $40.2 million in Q4 2016. Q4 2017 bookings were strong, coming in at $71.2 million, while Q4 2017 future contracted revenue rose to $536 million from $494 million in Q3 2017. Annual bookings grew 15% year-over-year from $254 million in 2016 to $291 million in 2017. Unit shipments in Q4 2017 reflected the Q3 2017 or early Q4 completions of several large customer deployments. Unit shipments also reflect some large deployments that pushed into Q1 2018. Q1 2018 is already off to a strong start for new orders. Australia'sVictoria Police will deploy 11,000 body cameras backed by Evidence.com, which will represent our second largest body camera deployment. We recorded 13 competitor conversion wins in Q4 2017 where our body-worn camera or Axon Fleet offering displaced a competitor, bringing our 2017 total to 46 customer conversions. In Q4 2017, we recorded 11 expansions where a state or major city police agency chose to upsize their contracts and expand their reliance upon the Axon network. Independent research reports continue to validate the benefits of body camera technology. In Q4 2017, an independent study was published showing that use-of-force complaints fell 37% at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department (LVMPD) after the agency deployed Axon body-worn cameras. Researchers also performed a cost-benefit analysis and found that body-worn cameras could ultimately save LVMPD up to $4 million per year in legal fees. The study was conducted by the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, and CNA, a non-profit research and analysis organization, and was funded by the U.S. Department of Justice. As of December 31, 2017, 37 of the 69 U.S. major city law enforcement agencies had purchased Axon body-worn cameras or our digital evidence management solution: Albuquerque, Atlanta, Austin, Baltimore, Baltimore County, Charlotte-Mecklenburg, Chicago, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Fort Worth, Fresno, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Louisville, Memphis, Mesa, Miami, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, Montgomery County, New Orleans, Omaha, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Sacramento, Salt Lake City, San Antonio, San Diego, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, Tampa, Tucson, Washington DC, and Wichita. Axon's Evidence.com platform user count continued to grow, extending our market leadership. During the three months ended December 31, 2017, we booked approximately 14,100 seats on our digital evidence management platform, Evidence.com, net of renewals. Since inception, we have booked cumulative Evidence.com licenses of approximately 201,500. Product Pipeline: Evidence.com - Evidence.com is a revolutionary way to manage digital evidence and the platform continues to expand its use cases. In fact, among agencies that are not yet ready to deploy body cameras, we are starting to see interest in Evidence.com products, including Axon Capture, which enables officers to capture evidence using their mobile phone cameras. Looking ahead, we see a significant opportunity to sell our software to agencies who are not using Axon hardware. We are pleased to note that the new redaction studio capabilities we rolled out in Q4 2017 are being met with positive reception from our early access program customers. One police agency redaction specialist told us, ""The Studio is a vast improvement on redaction! The object tracker works great, and when it misses, it's easy to realign. Spray Paint is super as well! I am so glad we have this new tool, once we get the hang of it well, it's going to be awesome, it already is! Thank you again."" Also, we are enhancing Evidence.com to make it easier for departments to ingest CCTV footage, which is currently a large pain point for our customers. Agencies want to put all forms of video into Evidence.com to take advantage of its advanced capabilities, such as sharing with detectives and prosecutors, as well as allowing videos to be redacted. Axon Citizen - Axon Citizen, the public evidence submission tool that we announced in Q4 2017, is also receiving positive feedback from early access agencies. Axon Citizen allows members of the community to use their mobile phones to send evidence directly to departments. It's exciting for us to watch agency customers take ownership of the tool and inform their own constituencies about their efforts to make communities safer https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYZQYZTKli4. In Q4, Axon Citizen helped with its first arrest after officers in an East Coast agency used the tool to allow a burglary victim to send videos of the suspect. Without Axon Citizen, if a member of the community has evidence on a mobile phone, the officer has to confiscate the phone for a week or longer to obtain the data. Officers also receive photos from the public via e-mail, which means the photo evidence lacks the audit trails required by law to be admissible in court and lacks meta-data to tie it to a specific case. Axon Citizen solves these problems by allowing an officer to text a secure link to victims and eye-witnesses, who can upload evidence to the department via Axon's secure cloud-based system. We're planning to launch a community-wide public evidence submission tool in mid-2018 that will allow departments to more easily manage evidence related to larger scale crimes, such as missing persons, shootings, bombings, or natural disasters. Camera Hardware - We also continue to invest in and improve our camera hardware. In February, we opened a small R&D office in Tampere, Finland, the country's second largest metropolitan area. A new team of world-renowned imaging experts (formerly the Nokia camera imaging team) have begun working on our next-generation body camera and Axon Fleet hardware. This added team is budget-neutral relative to the three-year plan we laid out at our November 2017 Investor & Analyst Day. Signal Sidearm - We have been improving and fine tuning our Signal Sidearm offering, which signals Axon cameras to begin recording after an officer removes a firearm from its holster. We're presently rolling out new functionality, which includes eliminating the production of nuisance videos generated when firearms are pulled in training or for reasons that don't include an intention to shoot. Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning - We are applying AI, machine learning and data science to common policing problems and eliminating pain points for agencies. Our AI investments in 2018 will span our product sets, including AI services at the edge (within devices) and in the cloud. Axon Records - Axon Records remains an important area of focus and investment. We are continuing to hire new software engineering talent to help us build the next generation of policing software. Our 2018 product milestone targets include launching our records management system (RMS) with select agencies. We are also actively collecting feedback from our development partners, who are running early iterations of Axon Records. We plan to deploy video-based incident report writing capability in the second half of 2018 to our early access partners. Our customer facing team is already engaged in pre-sales activities to support the launch of Axon Records later this year. Full Year 2018 Outlook: For the full year ending December 31, 2018, we expect to achieve the following: Revenue growth of 16% to 18%; We will disclose 2018 revenue amounts under accounting standards 605 and 606 beginning with our first quarter 10-Q; Operating margin expansion of 300 basis points to 400 basis points; A normalized tax rate of 20% to 25%, which can fluctuate depending on geography of income, change in stock price and the effect of discrete items; and Capital expenditures in the range of $12 million to $16 million. We remain confident in our goal of providing the premier end-to-end technology solution for law enforcement. We believe we are demonstrating the ability to morph from a hardware-only business into a subscription-hardware-plus-SAAS-solutions-and-enterprise-software company, and we look forward to updating you on our progress throughout 2018. Signed, Rick Smith, CEO Luke Larson, President Jawad Ahsan, CFO QUARTERLY CONFERENCE CALL & WEBCAST: The Company will host its Q4 2017 earnings conference call on Tuesday, February 27, 2018 at 2 p.m. PT / 5 p.m. ET. To join the live audio presentation, please dial toll free 877-303-9126, or for international callers, please dial+1-253-237-1156. The call will be available via live audio webcast and archived replay on Axon's investor relations website at http://investor.axon.com/. The Company has posted supplemental materials including its key operating metrics on its website to provide additional information about our fourth quarter financial results. Statistical Definitions: Bookings are an indication of the activity the Company is seeing relative to Software & Sensors hardware, software and Evidence.com. We consider bookings to be a statistical measure defined as the sales price of orders (not invoiced sales), including contractual optional periods we expect to be exercised, net of cancellations, placed in the relevant fiscal period, regardless of when the products or services ultimately will be provided. Most bookings will be invoiced in subsequent periods. Due to municipal government funding rules, in some cases certain of the future period amounts included in bookings are subject to budget appropriation or other contract cancellation clauses. Although Axon has entered into contracts for the delivery of products and services in the future and anticipates the contracts will be fulfilled, if agencies do not exercise contractual options, do not appropriate money in future year budgets or do enact a cancellation clause, revenue associated with these bookings may not ultimately be recognized, resulting in a future reduction to bookings. For more information relative to our revenue recognition policies, please reference our SEC filings. Non-GAAP Measures: To supplement the Company's financial results presented in accordance with GAAP, we present the non-GAAP financial measures of EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow. Our management uses these non-GAAP financial measures in evaluating the Company's performance in comparison to prior periods. We believe that both management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our performance, and when planning and forecasting our future periods. A reconciliation of GAAP to the non-GAAP financial measures is presented at the end of the release. EBITDA is defined as consolidated net income before interest expense, income taxes and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA, as presented herein, is defined as EBITDA before certain other items, including: stock-based compensation; net gain/loss on write-down/disposal/abandonment of property, equipment and intangible assets; and loss on impairment. Free Cash Flow is defined as cash flows provided by operating activities minus purchases of property, plant and equipment, and intangible assets. Caution on Use of Non-GAAP Measures Although these non-GAAP financial measures are not consistent with GAAP, management believes investors will benefit by referring to these non-GAAP financial measures when assessing the Company's operating results, as well as when forecasting and analyzing future periods. However, management recognizes that: these non-GAAP financial measures are limited in their usefulness and should be considered only as a supplement to the Company's GAAP financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation from, or as a substitute for, the Company's GAAP financial measures; these non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered to be superior to the Company's GAAP financial measures; and these non-GAAP financial measures were not prepared in accordance with GAAP and investors should not assume that the non-GAAP financial measures presented in this earnings release were prepared under a comprehensive set of rules or principles. Further, these non-GAAP financial measures may be unique to the Company, as they may be different from similarly titled non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies. As such, this presentation of non-GAAP financial measures may not enhance the comparability of the Company's results to the results of other companies.

AAXN,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon Public Safety Australia, a subsidiary of Axon Enterprise AAXN, +3.67% the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, today announced the purchase of 11,000 Axon Body 2 cameras by Victoria Police in Australia. Victoria Police secured a five-year subscription to the Axon cloud solution, Evidence.com, to help store, manage and share data from the body cameras and other digital evidence sources. The order was received in the first quarter of 2018 and will begin shipping in the second quarter of 2018. Victoria Police will begin a staggered roll-out of the body cameras in April 2018 with the goal of outfitting all front-line police officers with cameras by 2020. The roll-out will commence with an initial pilot at two police stations as part of Victoria Police's response to the Family Violence Royal Commission. The goal is to capture victim and perpetrator statements of family violence-related crimes more immediately by the first officers responding to the scene. The immediacy of these testimonies could help improve the overall judicial process by reducing the time victims need to spend in court. ""We are thrilled to see Victoria Police transform their agency with the adoption of body-worn camera technology,"" says Axon CEO and founder Rick Smith. ""We are proud that our investments in our rich hardware and software ecosystem allow us to be able to fulfill large-scale deployments such as this."" Victoria Police is the latest police force in Australia to join the Axon network, following Queensland Police Service (QPS) and Northern Territory Police. QPS recently conducted a case study on the effects of body-worn cameras on domestic and family violence (DFV) cases. Results showed a 22% projected increase in DFV reporting when first officers responding to the scene were wearing body cameras.

AAXN,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz., Feb. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Axon Public Safety Australia, a subsidiary of Axon Enterprise, the global leader in connected law enforcement technologies, today announced the purchase of 11,000 Axon Body 2 cameras by Victoria Police in Australia. Victoria Police secured a five-year subscription to the Axon cloud solution, Evidence.com, to help store, manage and share data from the body cameras and other digital evidence sources. The order was received in the first quarter of 2018 and will begin shipping in the second quarter of 2018. Victoria Police will begin a staggered roll-out of the body cameras in April 2018 with the goal of outfitting all front-line police officers with cameras by 2020. The roll-out will commence with an initial pilot at two police stations as part of Victoria Police's response to the Family Violence Royal Commission. The goal is to capture victim and perpetrator statements of family violence-related crimes more immediately by the first officers responding to the scene. The immediacy of these testimonies could help improve the overall judicial process by reducing the time victims need to spend in court. ""We are thrilled to see Victoria Police transform their agency with the adoption of body-worn camera technology,"" says Axon CEO and founder Rick Smith. ""We are proud that our investments in our rich hardware and software ecosystem allow us to be able to fulfill large-scale deployments such as this."" Victoria Police is the latest police force in Australia to join the Axon network, following Queensland Police Service (QPS) and Northern Territory Police. QPS recently conducted a case study on the effects of body-worn cameras on domestic and family violence (DFV) cases. Results showed a 22% projected increase in DFV reporting when first officers responding to the scene were wearing body cameras.

AAXN,"Jan 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Axon Enterprise continues to accrue significant potential damages through sales of infringing products while the case proceeds to trial Lenexa, KS, Jan. 26, 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Digital Ally, Inc. DGLY, +6.12% today provided an update on the potential damages accruing in its patent infringement lawsuit against Axon Enterprise, Inc. (""Axon,"" formerly known as TASER International, Inc.). The lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court of Kansas, accuses Axon of willfully infringing Digital's U.S. Patent No. 9,253,452 (the ""'452 Patent""). The products accused of infringement in this lawsuit cover Axon's camera products sold with Axon's Signal functionality, which Digital Ally alleges incorporate its patented auto-activation technology. Axon has continued to increase its sales of products utilizing Digital's patented technology while the lawsuit is pending. For example, in 2016 and 2017, Axon's public filings show $37,848,000 in total net sales of the accused Axon Body and Axon Flex cameras. Net sales of Evidence.com, which drives the sales of the accused products and is sold in conjunction with nearly every camera sale, totaled $69,958,000 in those years. Finally, Axon's public filings indicate that ""bookings,"" which Axon believes to be the best statistical measure of future contractual sales attributable to the company segment responsible for the accused cameras and evidence.com subscriptions, totaled $254,093,000 in 2016 and $219,998,000 in 2017. In November 2017, the Court rejected Axon's request to maintain a stay of the litigation and the case is now proceeding towards trial. The measure of Digital Ally's potential damages may be derived from Axon's reported sales from the infringing products and Digital will determine and provide a full accounting of the damages owed to it when it submits its expert report on damages. Digital will be seeking a reasonable royalty applied to the sales of Axon's products that have been accused of infringement, which it believes will amount to significant monetary damages, as well as an injunction and/or an accounting of damages for future sales. Digital also has alleged that Axon's infringement has been willful and, as such, Digital is also seeking that any damages awarded by a jury be tripled. ""Axon has continued to build its line of Axon camera products on the back of Digital's patented auto-activation technology,"" said Digital's CEO, Stanton E. Ross. ""It is frustrating to see our technology being used by a competitor to generate such massive sales, but we are confident the jury in Kansas will put an end to this willful infringement and reward Digital for its industry changing auto-activation technology.""
