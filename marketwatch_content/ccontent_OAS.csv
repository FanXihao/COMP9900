OAS,"Shares of Oasis Petroleum Inc. OAS, +0.00% sank 11% on heavy volume Tuesday, after the oil and gas exploration and production company announced a public offering of common stock, and after a SunTrust Robinson Humphrey downgrade. The stock was the biggest decline on the NYSE, and volume of 43 million shares was about five times the full-day average, and enough to make the stock the most actively traded on major U.S. exchanges. The company said late Monday that it was selling 32 million shares of common stock to the public for gross proceeds of approximately $321.9 million, implying a per-share price of about $10.06. Separately, the company said late Monday it agreed to buy 20,300 acres in the Delaware Basin for $946 million, consisting of $483 million in cash and 46 million shares of common stock. SunTrust RH analyst Neal Dingmann downgraded Oasis to hold from buy, and slashed his stock price target to $11 from $14, citing the ""hefty price"" the company paid to enter the Delaware Basin. The stock has plunged 41% year to date, while the SPDR Energy Select Sector ETF XLE, -0.96% has slipped 7.1% and the S&P 500 SPX, -0.86% has climbed 19%.","Dec 12, 2017 11:11 a.m. ET",N/A,"Oasis Petroleum's stock leads NYSE losers after share offering, analyst downgrade",https://www.marketwatch.com/story/oasis-petroleums-stock-leads-nyse-losers-after-share-offering-analyst-downgrade-2017-12-12
OAS,"Republicans tripped up the U.S. dollar this week by failing to make progress on replacing Obamacare. This hurt the greenback by casting doubts on other reforms promised by President Donald Trump — including tax cuts and infrastructure spending. Big picture, the GOP’s Obamacare setback is really only part of the problem for the dollar. Even if politicians miraculously get their act together (don't hold your breath) the dollar is still in for trouble. In fact, it's been weak all year for reasons that have little to do with Washington, D.C. — and those issues aren't going away soon. Indeed these challenges could bring a surprise breakdown in the dollar later this year, forcing investors to make some painful portfolio adjustments, says Jim Paulsen chief investment strategist at The Leuthold Group. We are sorry, we are unable to load this video. GUID {00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000} not found. Below, I offer a five-step plan on how to position your own portfolio now, to profit from the moves others will have to make later as dollar weakens further. But first, here are the three main reasons this unexpected dollar weakness will play out. 1: A global recovery is bidding up the value of other currencies For most of the recovery since 2009, U.S. growth has outpaced foreign growth. That made the dollar more attractive. People had to buy it to get access to more favorable U.S. growth. Nowadays, though, about two thirds of foreign economies are growing faster than the U.S. Europe is a good example. ""The economy is growing well above its potential, and while full employment is still a ways off, it now seems very achievable,"" says Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics. Meanwhile, growth in China has stabilized, erasing fears about a potential meltdown there. And many emerging markets are back on track. All of this means investment dollars are flowing out of U.S. assets into foreign countries. This, of course, puts downward pressure on the dollar and drives up foreign currencies. The trend is likely to persist. Leading economic indicators suggest foreign economies will continue to do well relative to the U.S. 2: Foreign bonds are becoming more attractive For much of the recovery, U.S. government bond yields were more attractive than foreign bond yields. But now, as foreign economies strengthen, that's changing. ""For the first time in more than five years, foreign bond yields are finally becoming more competitive relative to U.S. yield offerings,"" Paulsen says. This, too, is channeling money out of the U.S. and into foreign countries, driving up their currencies relative to the dollar. 3: U.S. inflation will heat up Many pundits think the greenback will hang in there because the Fed is hiking interest rates. This will entice foreign investors to buy dollars to get access to those higher yields, according to this theory. But to really understand what is going on here and what it means for the dollar, you have to consider why the Fed is hiking rates. And that spells trouble for the dollar. The Fed is raising rates because it sees signs of higher inflation. It wants raise rates to fulfill one of its two mandates — controlling inflation. To anyone owning dollars, inflation is bad news. It means they'll have less purchasing power. So they naturally sell greenbacks. Indeed, history is replete with evidence that the dollar weakens when inflation rises. The best example: High inflation during the 1970s hammered the dollar. Don't make the mistake of being lulled by the June inflation slowdown. That was probably caused by one-off events. One was the sharp decline in cell-phone prices linked to the rising popularity of unlimited plans. Another was measurement problems related to changes in how doctors report their fees to government statisticians, Zandi says. ""The Fed continues to downplay the recent drop in core inflation,” agrees Barclays economist  Blerina Uruçi. Leuthold’s Paulsen thinks tight labor markets will soon push wage inflation above 3%, and this will boost consumer prices as people buy more stuff. ""We expect inflation anxieties to worsen in the second half of this year,"" he says. If inflation suppresses the dollar, as it normally does, matters will get worse. A weaker dollar bids up commodity prices. This leads to more inflation. And this erodes the dollar even more. Partly because of this feedback loop, a breakdown in the dollar could push wage and consumer price inflation to 3%-4%, says Paulsen, which would shock a lot of people. A key factor to watch: Any move in the dollar below its current trading range. Since early 2015, the U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.05%  , a measure of the dollar against a basket of foreign currencies, has traded in the 94-103 range. If it breaks out of that range to the downside, it will wake up a lot of investors to the potential for more dollar weakness. They'll scramble to adjust their portfolios. What to buy now: Here's what you can do now to benefit as investors make necessary changes to adapt to this new investing climate. Paulsen provided guidance on the themes below, and I've filled in suggestions on specific stocks and exchange traded funds.   1. Buy commodities: A weaker dollar pushes up commodity prices. So buying them now makes sense. Consider gaining exposure via PowerShares DB Commodity Index Tracking Fund DBC, -0.43%  , or the US Commodity Index USCI, +0.11% Or for gold US:GCQ7  exposure, iShares Gold Trust IAU, +0.82% or SPDR Gold Trust GLD, +0.77% 2. Go foreign: Emerging markets tend to perform well when commodity prices rise. Buying them now ahead of a dollar decline makes sense. Consider Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets VWO, -0.69%    or iShares MSCI Emerging Markets EEM, -0.91%   3. Be cautious with bonds and yield plays: A weaker U.S. dollar and rising commodity prices will magnify inflation fears and pressure the Fed to hike more aggressively. That will be bad for bonds. The damage could be significant. Paulsen thinks the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury TMUBMUSD10Y, +0.73%  may rise to 3%-3.5% over the next year, from recent levels in the low 2% range. Bonds sink when yields rise, of course. Likewise, yield plays among utilities, telecom and consumer staples may get hurt. So be cautious with names such as Duke Energy DUK, +0.54% Dominion Energy D, +0.82% Southern Company SO, +0.44%  , Verizon Communications VZ, -0.48%  , AT&T T, -0.52%  , Procter & Gamble PG, -0.40% and Colgate-Palmolive CL, -0.29%  . You can short bonds by purchasing an inverse bond exchange traded fund like ProShares Short 20+ Year Treasury TBF, +0.22%   4. Get long energy: A declining dollar may push the price of crude oil above $60 for the first time in more than two and a half years, Paulsen predicts. This would benefit beaten-down energy stocks. Consider buying United States Oil Fund USO, -1.45% or SPDR S&P Oil & Gas Explore & Production ETF XOP, -1.68%  . Investment researcher Morningstar has a four star rating, out of five, on Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A, -0.57%  , Marathon Oil MRO, -1.92%   and Oasis OAS, -0.25%  . 5. Go with small-caps: Smaller companies tend to be leaner. So when prices rise, more of the extra revenue falls to the bottom line. In my stock newsletter I've recently suggested KMG Chemicals KMG, +1.10%   which sells chemicals used in chip making and energy production, Huntsman HUN, -1.68%  , another chemicals company, and Fiesta Restaurant Group FRGI, +0.00% a restaurant turnaround story. Plus, recent insider buying in these small-cap stocks looks pretty good. At the time of publication, Michael Brush had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column. Brush has suggested OAS, MRO, KMG, HUN, FRGI in his stock newsletter .

OAS,"The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries’ (OPEC) extension of production cuts is good news for energy-stock bulls, even though oil is tanking Thursday. Some traders and investors were expecting a longer time frame or larger cuts. But, still, lower production will eventually lead to higher prices — supply and demand. July Brent crude futures UK:LCON7  tumbled. But the possibility of higher prices in the months ahead isn’t the real reason you should be bulking up on energy shares. Instead, overweight the sector because corporate insiders have been big buyers all year as their stocks have lagged behind the broader market. I offer, below, 16 of the best energy-insider purchases to consider. But first, here are the top six reasons why energy insiders are buying, according to investment pros who also favor the group. Reason 1: Oil stocks have fallen a lot, but oil has not Energy stocks are the worst-performing group this year. The Energy Select Sector SPDR exchange traded fund US:XLE is down 10%, compared with a 7.4% gain for the S&P 500 Index US:SPX But this isn’t even the most interesting divergence. Instead, that distinction goes to the gap between energy stock and oil. Energy stocks have tanked, but oil today trades where it did at the start of the year. “There is a huge disconnect,” says Eric Green, director of research at Penn Capital. “The pessimism on the stock side is unique.” The gap is even more startling for many individual stocks. One Penn Capital holding, Sanchez Energy US:SN is down over 50% from its January highs. “Where has oil gone? It has gone from $51 [a barrel] to $51,” says Green. “It doesn’t make sense.” This kind of disconnect helps explain why Green’s Penn Capital Small Cap Equity US:PSCNX is overweight energy. I think Green is worth listening to because his small-cap fund and the Penn Capital Opportunistic High-Yield Fund US:PHYNX have both significantly outperform their benchmarks over the past year, according to Morningstar. “Something is wrong. Either the price of oil is unsustainable or these stocks are underpriced,” says Green. Let’s look at why it is probably the latter. Reason 2: Global petroleum inventories are declining The last time OPEC agreed to curtail production, in late 2016, it delayed the start date until Jan. 1. “So a lot of countries overproduced in November and December,” says Mike Breard, an energy analyst at Hodges Capital Management. That flooded the world with crude oil, a lot of which wound up in U.S. inventories. The U.S. is the go-to market for sellers, in part because storage is cheaper. The spike in inventories alarms oil analysts, who take it as a bearish signal for crude. Now, though, inventories in the U.S. and around the globe are shrinking. The data on global inventories are opaque and delayed. This means analysts disagree on global inventory trends. To cut through the noise, I like to consult Greg Armstrong, the CEO of Plains All American Pipeline US:PAA who offers running commentary on oil markets in investor presentations. His take is that global petroleum inventories are trending down in a significant enough way. If he’s right, investors will catch on and get more bullish on oil. Reason 3: Service companies want more money After years of making concessions to customers, energy-services companies are starting to raise prices. “We are seeing signs of cost inflation,” says Jonathan Waghorn, who helps manage the Guinness Atkinson Global Energy Fund US:GAGEX “Producers are hiring services companies, then the company says ‘I can’t give you the crew because someone bid them away at a higher price.’ ” Energy analysts at Barclays expect average cost inflation of 10% for 2017. This will limit production growth. And that supports higher oil prices, says Waghorn. He thinks Brent crude oil will trade at an average of $55 a barrel this year, $65 next year and $70 after that. Reason 4: Energy production is in a constant state of natural decline “The one thing in the oil industry that never stops is depletion,” says Breard, at Hodges Capital Management. “You have to keep drilling. It’s like a treadmill.” Penn Capital’s Green puts the natural production decline rate at about 3% a year. On average production of around 96 million barrels a day, that means daily production declines by around 2.9 million barrels over the course of a year. Meanwhile, because of rapid growth and an emerging middle class in developing countries, there’s an equivalent natural consumption growth of around 1 million to 2 million barrels. In other words, there’s a big gap to fill. Because of energy-services bottlenecks and cost increases for U.S. shale producers, Green thinks oil bears overestimate how much the U.S. can make up the difference. Reason 5: Big oil has under-investment in big projects In response to the sharp oil-price decline during 2014-2016, major producers and big national oil companies around the world cut back investments in long-term projects in 2015 and 2016. That’s unusual. The sector hasn’t seen two consecutive years of cutbacks since 1986. And the magnitude of the cutbacks is much bigger this time around, says Armstrong, the CEO of Plains All American Pipeline. Investment was cut by 26% and 23%, respectively, in 2015 and 2016. Armstrong thinks this could create a supply-demand gap that causes an oil-price spike over the next two to three years. Reason 6: Geopolitical instability threatens supply Major oil producers face problems at home that could disrupt supply at any moment. Venezuela is in turmoil because of protests against the government. Political uncertainly there makes it more difficult for the country to borrow or sell assets to raise funds, which increases the risk of default, says Barclays analyst Michael Cohen. A cash crunch could hurt oil production. Nigerian supply regularly gets disrupted by anti-government protestors. In Libya, production is either inconsistent or threatened by ISIS. Saudi Arabia, the second-biggest oil producer after the U.S., needs high energy prices to fund government-benefits programs and jobs, which help keep the peace. Saudi Arabia is in a bind, which supports the outlook for higher oil prices. Saudi Arabia is at or near maximum production. This means if oil prices decline sharply, it has little room to increase production to boost revenue. This gives it a big incentive to favor higher prices. What could go wrong for energy-stock bulls? Energy analysts at Goldman Sachs cite the following three reasons why oil prices could fall from here — and possibly by a lot. 1. They doubt production costs in the U.S. will increase enough this year and next to derail shale-production growth. 2. Back in 2011-13, before oil prices started to fall in 2014, big energy producers around the world funded lots of large-scale projects. They never canceled them. So that supply will hit the market soon. The years “2017 to 2019 are likely to see the largest increase in mega-project production in history,” says Goldman Sachs energy sector analyst Michele Della Vigna. An added twist: Since these companies cut back on new projects starting in 2014-15, they have more time to focus on making those 2011-13 projects coming on line now even more productive. 3. About a fifth of the U.S. shale production is funded by cheap credit. Producers borrow at just 7%, one of the lowest rates for these kinds of relatively risky loans in recent years, says Goldman Sachs. The high-yield credit market “is not yet forcing capital discipline,” says Goldman Sachs credit analyst Jason Gilbert. “We believe a tighter credit market will be required to avoid an oversupplied oil market in 2018-19.” He estimates yields on shale-related debt will have to rise to 10%-13% to bring that discipline about. Will that happen in a low-interest-rate environment? So far, the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates gradually, so maybe not. An insider take At least one experienced industry insider agrees that it’s no sure bet oil goes higher from here. As the founder and former CEO of Cheniere Energy US:LNG Charif Souki has been closely watching energy markets for decades. Souki left Cheniere last year and founded Tellurian Investments US:TELL an early-stage liquid natural gas export company. In this capacity, he’ll be a buyer of natural gas in the U.S. at some point. So he’s watching shale oil and gas production developments closely. We are in the early innings, but the developments continue to be spectacular, he says. “Things can go very right in the U. S. This could be a very significant game changer,” says Souki. “So I don’t like the risk that this could put pressure on oil prices. Production can increase quickly. They keep getting better.” On the other hand, he agrees the lack of big-project investments by the majors combined with political risks in producing countries could spark significant supply shortages, driving up oil prices. The bottom line? Given the balance of the risks in either direction, he thinks oil is priced about right in the $50-$60 range. “But the risk of getting it wrong on the upside or downside are very large,” he says. That level of risk and uncertainty may be the best explanation of why so many investors have simply abandoned energy stocks. If you want to take the other side of that trade and bet alongside energy insiders, then the following stocks are the best names to consider, since they’re the ones with some of the most compelling insider buying. They are Continental Resources US:CLR Occidental Petroleum US:OXY Helmerich & Payne US:HP Nabors Industries US:NBR Dominion Energy US:D Hess US:HES Matador Resources US:MTDR Oasis Petroleum US:OAS Murphy US:MUR Spark Energy US:SPKE Carrizo Oil & Gas US:CRZO SM Energy US:SM Parsley Energy US:PE Energy XXI Gulf Coast US:EXXI Chesapeake Energy US:CHK  and Superior Energy Services US:SPN At the time of publication, Michael Brush held TELL and CRZO. Brush has suggested TELL, CRZO, CLR, OXY, HP, HES, MTDR, OAS, SM and PE in his stock newsletter, Brush Up on Stocks.

OAS,"One of the stranger things about the Trump rally is that the energy sector has been left behind. This group should theoretically be a top performer since it’s hampered by regulation and its products are easily exported. This puts energy squarely in the crosshairs of President Trump’s economic policy, of which two core components are reducing regulations and promoting exports. Yet energy is the absolute worst performer among the S&P 500’s 11 sectors this year. It was down 5.5% through Monday, compared with a 6.1% gain for the S&P 500 SPX, -1.17% Exxon XOM, -0.94% one of the best-quality names in the space, is trading near 52-week lows. UPDATE What gives with energy? And is the weakness a buying opportunity? My take is that the group looks like a buy, for the following reasons. Insider vote of confidence Let’s start with the insiders. I’ve tracked insiders for clues about the market for decades, and their buying is a core part of how I come up with a short list of stocks to research for my stock letter Brush Up on Stocks. Two key lessons on insiders support a bullish call on energy now. First, energy insiders tend to be among the more accurate buyers (though of course like all insiders they can be early). Second, whenever you see a broad swath of insiders buying a group on a pullback, it can be a good signal that it’s time to overweight the group. That looks like the case with energy stocks right now. Over the past few weeks there’s been significant insider buying in over a dozen energy stocks, including Halliburton HAL, -1.90%  in services, Hess HES, -2.05% Oasis Petroleum OAS, -0.56%  and Matador Resources MTDR, -3.04% in production, and Marathon Petroleum MPC, -0.60% in refining. (I’ll list the others, below.) To find out why insiders are buying the group, I recently checked in with three sector experts who know the sector a lot better than I do, because they’ve been following it every day for years. The bottom line: There’s a plausible case to be made that investors are selling energy stocks for reasons which don’t really add up. If so — and the insiders are confirming this — then the energy sector is a buy. I’ll suggest a few energy names that look attractive in a second. But first, here’s why investors are selling this group, and why they might be wrong. Inventories rising Late last year, Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to impose tighter production quotas starting Jan. 1. Ahead of that, OPEC members produced like crazy to get as much oil on the market ahead of those restrictions. It takes six weeks or more for oil to arrive by boat to the U.S., the market of last resort for energy. But as it did, U.S. inventories began to build this year, unsettling investors. “The market looks at the big build up in U.S. inventories and gets nervous,” says Jonathan Waghorn who helps manage the Guinness Atkinson Global Energy Fund GAGEX, +2.06% Investors are still shellshocked after a U.S. inventory glut helped suppress oil prices and crush energy stocks two years ago. So any sign of a repeat has them selling. But they might be worrying too much about this. The current inventory buildup is due mainly to that heavy OPEC production ahead of the new quotas, which makes it a one-off event. U.S. inventories should start to ease at some point, and oil prices and energy stocks may rise as a result. “I think inventory will start dropping and oil will start moving higher, possibly this month,” says Mike Breard, energy analyst at Hodges Capital Management. Waghorn thinks it could take a bit longer. U.S. producers: They’re baack! Thanks to higher energy prices, U.S. shale producers are back. They’re deploying a lot more rigs. The rig count is back up over 600 compared with a low of 316 in May 2016 — and they are fracking a lot more. This also brings back bad memories of hefty losses for energy investors. Opinion Journal: Coming Next: Shale’s Silicon Valley Boost That’s because excess U.S. production — combined with the tactical flood of oil from Saudi Arabia meant to destroy U.S. supply by suppressing oil prices — was one of the main reasons a lot of investors lost their shirts in energy stocks starting in 2014. Now, investors are watching the rising U.S. rig count and thinking, “Oh no, not again.” So they are getting out of energy stocks. But worries about excess U.S. production may well be a false fear for the following reasons. • First, as U.S. producers cut back over the past few years, they naturally kept their best wells online. Now, as they add production they are bringing on less efficient wells, or “low grading.” And service companies are going to continue to hike prices, reversing concessions made during the bad days, points out Credit Suisse energy analyst Jan Stuart. The upshot: Production might not ramp as quickly as investors worry. At some point producers will need to wait for higher prices, to make it worthwhile to add these less efficient wells. “You don’t get as much oil for your money in the future. So U.S. producers will need higher prices to increase production,” says Waghorn. • Besides, U.S. producers are only a piece of the oil price puzzle, and a relatively small one at that — responsible for about a 10th of global production. Elsewhere in the world, production restraints are likely, which tells us oil prices may move higher. OPEC, for example, will probably remain disciplined on production because of national budget constraints in Saudi Arabia, says John Groton, director of equity research at Thrivent Financial, who has followed the energy space for years. He thinks Saudi Arabia needs oil in the upper $60-per barrel range to balance its national budget. Oil US:CLJ7   has traded recently in the mid-$50 range. And in regions outside of the U.S. and OPEC — responsible for about half of global production —- capital spending was “utterly destroyed” during the recent bout of low energy prices, says Waghorn. These energy producers will be slow to bring that spending back online. In any case, projects take years to complete. So production from this source of supply probably won’t increase, and it is likely to decline. Meanwhile, global demand will continue to rise because most of the major economies in the world are expanding. The bottom line: Oil will move up from here, probably to around $70 a barrel over the next three years, believes Waghorn, the manager of the Guinness Atkinson Global Energy Fund. One for the quants Here’s one more reason energy stocks look like a buy: Oil prices and energy stocks are oddly out of synch. During the first two months of the year, the MSCI World Energy Index underperformed world markets by 10 percentage points, says Waghorn. Since the start of the year, the MSCI Energy Index is down 5.0%, while the MSCI World Index is up by 5.3% through early March. This is highly unusual. It has only happened 21 times since 1983. Even more unusual: Energy stocks have been going down in the past few months while oil prices have been going up — at least slightly. This has only happened three times over the past several decades (January 1999, October 1987 and April 1986). Quants look for unusual anomalies like these because trends often revert to the mean. Indeed, energy stocks outperformed the market substantially six months to two years after each time we’ve seen this anomaly, says Waghorn. Given the overall supply constraints and the slim chance of a quick snap back in U.S. production from here, that seems probable. How to invest and do good How to play this One way is to simply buy funds dedicated to investing in the group, like Waghorn’s fund. Another is to follow the insiders. Besides Halliburton, Oasis, Matador, Hess and Marathon Petroleum, which has a four out of five star rating at Morningstar, insiders were also recently buying in significant amounts at Carrizo Oil & Gas CRZO, -2.50% Parsley Energy PE, -1.22% Newfield Exploration NFX, -2.66% Energy XXI US:EXXI SM Energy SM, -3.88% QEP Resources QEP, +0.20% Martin Midstream Partners MMLP, -0.37% Plains GP PAGP, +0.34% Panhandle Oil and Gas PHX, -1.30%  and Parker Drilling PKD, -3.15% Breard, at Hodges Capital Management, follows Comstock Resources CRK, -5.81% closely. He has made some great contrarian calls on the company, favoring it last spring when it traded below $4, ahead of a move above $12. He likes the name in the current pullback into the $8-$9 range. “Comstock looks awfully cheap,” he says, especially considering that over the next several weeks they are bringing several wells online in untapped territory, which suggests they will be particularly productive. He also likes Parsley Energy. which he says has good properties in the Permian and Delaware basins. Top holdings at Guinness Atkinson Global Energy Fund include Newfield, Devon Energy DVN, -1.98% Carrizo, QEP Resources, Apache APA, -1.01% Occidental Petroleum OXY, -0.18% ConocoPhillips COP, -1.29%  and Noble NE, -1.75% What about Exxon? If oil prices really are going back up to $70 over the next few years, it might not be the best energy name to own. In this scenario, investors will favor smaller, lower quality energy companies that use more leverage to fund development over more conservative, larger players like Exxon, Chevron CVX, -0.32%   and ConocoPhillips. Michael Brush is a Manhattan-based financial writer At the time of publication, he had no positions in any stocks mentioned in this column.

OAS,"AFP/Getty Images OPEC reached an agreement this morning to cut oil production more significantly than anyone expected. In the past, OPEC agreements have suffered from widespread cheating. This time it is somewhat different, in that most of the cuts are coming from Saudi Arabia, and in our opinion, Saudi Arabia tends to cheat a lot less than others and often keeps its commitments. For this reason, it is time for a fresh look at some oil stocks and ETFs. Below, I will discuss three oil stocks for investors, a super major suitable for most, a rocket ship suitable only for aggressive investors and a high-risk, high-reward special situation. I will also discuss two stocks that are great for short-term trading, and two ETFs in our portfolio. The super major In our analysis, the best oil super major to buy is Royal Dutch Shell RDS.B, -0.70% We have changed our buy zones since my last column. This environmentally friendly oil super major yields 6.85%, but there is no other significant change in our analysis. The rocket ship Marathon Oil MRO, -2.29% is a high-octane investment suitable for aggressive investors only. Our average price is 11.38. As of this writing, the stock is trading at 18.22. Our new buy zone on a pullback is 14.00 to 16.26. If oil goes to $70.00 and stays there, this stock can double. There is no free lunch, the stock has significant risk because of its poor balance sheet. High risk, high reward Weatherford WFT, -4.59% an oil-service company, is a high-risk, high-reward special situation. If oil moves to about $70, there is the potential to triple your money in three years. The stock is not far from our buys. The chart shows the buys and the very long-term target zone. Please click here for the annotated chart. The high risk in this stock is because its balance sheet is in poor shape. If oil falls to the $20 range and stays there, this stock will likely head toward zero. Those looking for an oil-service firm with a better balance sheet may consider Halliburton HAL, -1.83% on a pullback. Halliburton is in our portfolio. Two for the short term In my experience, the two best short-term oil trading stocks these days are Oasis Petroleum OAS, -1.11% and Continental Resources CLR, -1.26% These are high-beta stocks. In plain English, they move a lot, providing excellent trading opportunities. The annotated chart shows our purchase this morning, which is already showing about 14% gain. Please click here for the annotated chart. Two ETFs Our favorite ETF is oil services ETF OIH, -1.68% We did a small purchase this morning. The other ETF in our portfolio is natural gas ETF FCG, -1.80% Caution A big part of the move in oil stocks today is short-covering. Moves based on short-covering are often not sustainable. It is best to buy on pullbacks. Also, the best risk-control method in these volatile stocks is proper position sizing. Stop-loss orders should only be the second line of defense, otherwise you risk getting whipsawed.

OAS,"Getty Images In Pennsylvania, from 1859 to the 1870s, America saw its first oil rush. The Texas oil boom was soon to follow in the early 1900s. By 1970, U.S. oil production peaked at 9,637,000 barrels per day. Just a few short years later, the United States was faced with an energy crisis perpetuated by OPEC in the face of our inability to balance domestic supply and demand for oil. The U.S. response to the energy crisis was to establish deeper relations with Saudi Arabia. For more than three decades the United States saw declining production of her own oil while she imported more and more. However, in 2009, something finally began to change. For the first time since 1981, American oil production showed a year over year increase in production. This would not be a one-time event. Over the past six years, U.S. oil production has risen in every year. Even this year, with cutbacks in capital spending, it looks like production will continue to tick upward to be very near or even slightly above the record set in 1970. Next year might be a different story. In 2011, when I was awarded the ""Next Great Investing Columnist"" title, the column which won that competition was titled ""The One General Thing That Changes Everything for America."" In that column, and about dozen subsequent columns in 2012, I talked about how a developing boom in domestic oil and gas production would completely change global economic and geopolitical dynamics. By last year, the changes in economics and power had become very evident to those paying attention. Volatility around the globe is not unrelated to the fact that America is no longer energy dependent. In response to that new reality, Saudi Arabia allowed the price of oil to plunge, something I foreshadowed in my June 5 column ""The Peak Oil Plateau and What it Means to Investors."" In that column, I anticipated that ""out of the ordinary price plunges"" in oil could occur and that would open the door ""for unique leverage opportunities by enterprising investors."" What I did not anticipate is how fast the demand destruction for oil I have discussed before is really developing. Just this week, we saw the G7 agree to cut carbon emissions a record amount in the next three-and-a-half decades and end fossil fuel use altogether this century. In the past few years, we have already seen an extended flat period in oil demand, due to the financial crisis, that has only recently shown modest gains according to the International Energy Agency. With a concerted effort by governments to curb oil use and new available supplies of petroleum in the United States, the peak oil plateau I described last year should be coming into focus. In coming years, presuming no substantial geopolitical shocks, oil demand will struggle to keep pace with oil supply, keeping pressure on oil prices. Ultimately, probably in the 2020s sometime, the beginning of mass adoption of electric vehicles will begin to put a significant dent in oil demand as transportation is over 60% of all petroleum used globally (about two-thirds in the United States). Those are the sorts of things that should make would be investors in oil stocks, start to look at solar and electric vehicle stocks either instead of, or at least in addition to, oil company stocks. That is not to say that there won't be oil stocks to invest in eventually, however, picking the share-price winners is going to be difficult and it seems to me that the shakeout is not complete. At a minimum, investors should expect dilution, and more likely a few more bankruptcies or ""take-unders."" Companies like a former favorite of mine, Whiting Petroleum WLL, -2.57% might not come out of this intact after the oil-price collapse and aggressive purchase of Kodiak Oil & Gas — a company whose stability I warned about back in late 2013. It would not be surprising to see Whiting purchased for only a slight premium to their currently beaten down price due to their debts. Oasis Petroleum OAS, -2.35%  and Continental Resources CLR, -2.49% both companies I recommended buying in 2012 before big runs upward, might not fetch significant premiums either. Both companies are suffering from high debt, and Continental's Harold Hamm made a terrible mistake lifting the company's oil price hedges last September. The main reason to buy a few oil stocks sometime soon is as a hedge on geopolitical risk. To that end, my clients and subscribers have a few names handy for when the prices come to us. However, as David Einhorn pointed out a month ago, it is probably better to have a hedge in actual oil, if you are worried about a spike in price. To buy oil, be extremely careful if you are tempted to buy one of the ETF/ETN products, such as the United States Oil Fund USO, -2.10%  or iPath S&P GSCI Oil Trust OIL, -2.87% which both suffer from contango degradation more often than not if held longer than a few weeks. With the collapse in the price of oil and oil stocks, many investors today are looking toward oil stocks for great value opportunities. Most of them are likely to fall into value traps in the short-term. In the long-term, the opportunities might not be as clear cut as in the past. The age of oil has now begun to end, and that means at least more volatility, so be aware and beware, the world is changing in a massive way.

OAS,"New York (MarketWatch) — Last month, I wrote here that oil would “go from worst to first” as it rebounds from a horrific 2014 decline. It was a strategic view with only loose timing aspects simply because there was not enough technical evidence to say the timing was right. Well, the timing is right now. TRADING STRATEGIES: FEB. MarketWatch illustration • Make a date with these three stocks • My profitable relationship with Exact Sciences • See full Trading Strategies report for February   This is not a “back up the truck” forecast, but rather a call to start getting back into a least-loved and most-undervalued sector of the stock market. There is no law that says investments have to be all or none, and if I am correct, then adding to winning positions, as trading academies might preach, is an always available option. My favorites are the major international oil companies because as crude oil was making lower lows over the past few months, stocks such as Exxon Mobil XOM, -1.64%  made flat or higher lows. Chart watchers call this is a bullish divergence and it is usually a good sign when energy stocks lead the commodity. Let’s take a look at Exxon. It scored interim lows in October, December and January at roughly 86.25 (see Chart 1). But that is not as important as this zone eliciting buying activity even as crude oil sank from $80 to $45 over that same period. Investors apparently saw beyond the short-term oil decline and thought this company would be able to weather the storm. I’d call that demand for the stock just waiting to be unleashed with a technical breakout. Where would that breakout be? A move above the trendline that guided the stock lower since last July would do the trick. Trading as I write these words is now bumping up against that line at 92.21. While I do not expect oil to return to its old highs any time soon, Exxon is only down 12% from its own high. Given the size of the October-February consolidation pattern, simply trading in the same sized range would bring it almost all the way there. In other words, if and when the stock breaks out, there is the potential for a nice run higher over the next few months. For investors with a little higher risk tolerance, we can dig deeper into the sector for a sub-group that has been truly forsaken – the so-called shale-oil group. These oil and gas exploration and production stocks were heroes as oil moved higher, but as prices fell, their share prices collapsed (see Chart 2). For example, Oasis Petroleum OAS, -2.10%  traded as high as 58 last July, but by December it was down to 11.00. It rebounded into the end of the year by softened in January. However, as with Exxon above, its January low was higher than that seen in December. Another bullish price divergence with crude oil and a hint that the environment was changing. Volume characteristics agreed. During its final selloff in December, volume swelled to many multiples of its average, and I read that as a final cleansing of bullishness. All supply was used up. This month, as it rallied sharply, volume swelled again to suggest there was real demand back in play. It is now back above its 50-day moving average and money is flowing back into the stock according to the on-balance volume study. More shares are changing hands on up days than on down days, which confirms the resurgence of demand. To be sure, shale-oil stocks are still risky, as they are still very small in terms of market capitalization. Plus, they need higher oil prices to justify the expense of extracting oil from shale. But if the charts are a guide, and I believe they are, then smart money is looking past current oil prices believing shale-oil companies will be profitable in the future. There are many varieties of energy stocks and not all are ready to accumulate. As long as short-term trends are up and selected technicals such as volume and moving averages are supportive, there should be good opportunities in the sector over the next few months.

OAS,"While the crash in oil prices is certainly cause for concern when it comes to energy stocks, it is also affording brave investors the opportunity to buy into companies at reduced rates, and Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group is one of the companies taking advantage of this. Citadel disclosed in a recent filing with the SEC that it has upped its stake in Newfield Exploration Co. NFX, -3.07% to 8.57 million shares, accounting for 6.2% of that company's common shares. That's an increase of 3.39 million shares. Citadel Investment Group is one of the largest hedge funds in the world, with an equity portfolio that was valued at a staggering $79.77 billion as of September 30. The fund was launched in 1990 by Griffin, with assets under management of just $4.2 million. With nearly 1,000 employees and offices in 10 cities around the world, the fund now has assets under management surpassing $100 billion. In 2008, Griffin was one of the first 14 hedge fund managers to be deservedly inducted into the Institutional Investor's Alpha Hedge Fund Hall of Fame. Insider Monkey tracks the moves of hedge funds because our research has shown that the top small-cap stock picks of hedge funds historically outperformed the market by an average of 18 percentage points a year. We have also been sharing these stock picks in our newsletter in real-time for the past 29 months and managed to deliver an annualized return of 37% vs. 18% annual gain for the S&P 500 index during the same period (see the details here). Interestingly, it appears Citadel sold off a large chunk of their shares briefly, before their most recent move to invest even heavier. We reported in early November that they had increased their position in Newfield Exploration Co. to 7.28 million shares from the 2.58 million they had reported on September 30. However their recent filing dated to December 30 indicates they sold 2.1 million of those shares between then and the end of the year, as oil prices worsened and the stock was just about to have its roughest stretch, falling 33% from late November to the middle of December. Newfield Exploration Co.'s stock has since rebounded to gain 33% back from those December lows, and with oil prices widely assumed to have bottomed out (though not necessarily set to rebound in any significant way for some time), Ken Griffin clearly feels the time is right to make a big move into this stock. Nor is it the only energy stock he's shown interest in at such depleted values. In addition to their most recent investment in Newfield Exploration Co., Citadel also raised its exposure to Bonanza Creek Energy Inc. BCEI, -3.57% in early January, nearly doubling its position to 2.35 million shares and a 5.7% stake in the company. While Newfield Exploration Co. is down 28.01% since July 1, many other energy stocks have fared even worse, with Bonanza falling 48.48% during that same time frame, and Oasis Petroleum Inc. OAS, -2.04% plummeting 67.26%. That is perhaps one of the strongest signals that the company is on good financial ground, that it has weathered the disastrous dip in oil prices as relatively well as it has, and is now making a big move north. Newfield Exploration Co. is up 17.33% year-to-date, and 38.95% since January 14. Some of that optimism comes from their China operations, which the company announced that they would retain on January 13, rather than sell. Those operations are expected to generate significant free cash flow over the next few years, which can be used to pay down debt and provide added liquidity. In its most recent quarterly results, for the third quarter of 2014, Newfield posted a strong $2.02 earnings per share, up from earnings of just $0.05 per share during the same year-ago period. They will announce their fourth quarter and full-year results for 2014 later this month. The recent surge has been bad news for short positions, which had increased by 36.5% from December 31 to January 15, to 7.7 million shares. The shorts clearly didn't anticipate what it appears Citadel Investment did: that the stock was poised for a turnaround as oil prices bottomed out and stabilized, which they were bound to do. That's why we put our trust in the best hedge funds in the world to predict and be on the cutting edge of trends long before the rest of the market has caught on, and Citadel Investment Group is certainly one of those. Other top funds we track with positions in Newfield Exploration Co. as of September 30 were Andreas Halvorsen's Viking Global with 9.02 million shares, Israel Englander's Millennium Management with 2.21 million shares, and Terence Hogan's Addison Clark Management with 1.83 million shares.

OAS,"The Kansas City Star story cited in the call of the day was updated to accurately reflect Cook’s opinion that Hillary Clinton has a 25% to 30% chance of not running for president. Getty Images The bet-against-the-herd crowd has to be licking its chops over the carnage in the oil pits. When the billionaire chairman of Canadian Natural Resources warns crude could hit $30 a barrel, contrarian alarms should be ringing from Alberta to Pascagoula. Normally, a target that sticky would be a shoo-in for our call of the day, but not when Hillary Clinton “has lost her fastball” (more on that below). Instead, we’ll carve out a space for oil in our chart section, where one money manager uses Warren Buffett as a guide to finding value in the space. As Jason Zweig explained in a MoneyBeat post over the weekend, “when the consensus is strong, it’s wrong.” Optimism was running high among the institutional set before this latest price destruction. But gird for “apocalyptically low” calls now — like, hey, $30 a barrel. “Watch for the last optimists to be swept away by pessimism — at which point it will be an opportune time to add to your energy stocks or MLPs,” Zweig wrote. “We’re probably not there yet.” While we wait, oil isn’t the only option for those looking to swim upstream. Gold — and the rest of the metals sector, for that matter — is melting this morning, after hopes for a hoarding Swiss National Bank were dashed. Silver is at its five-year nadir. If jumping on the equity-bull bandwagon sounds more appealing than catching any of those falling knives, then you could pick worse months to be long the Dow industrials. December has ended in the green five years in a row. Overall, this month has been a winner 72% of the time, going back 117 years. Reeling oil prices is a wild card that this market will have to digest in the coming days and weeks if blue chips are going to see number six. Consumers might have more money to spend with gas prices falling, but you wouldn’t know it from how reluctant they were to go big on Black Friday. Key market gauges The bleeding in oil continues. Crude CLZ5, -0.17%  is down below $65 a barrel for the first time since 2010, and it’s taken another 2% blow this morning. Prices have now fallen for five straight months, in a run that hasn’t been seen since the 2008 financial crisis. Gold US:GCZ4  will be jockeying with crude for the spotlight, with prices cratering after Swiss voters rejected a measure that would required Switzerland’s national bank to seriously ramp up its gold holdings. Meanwhile, U.S. stocks are wavering in the early going, with futures on the Dow US:YMZ4  and the S&P US:ESZ4  beating a retreat. Europe SXXP, +0.44%  isn’t faring much better, as oil and mining stocks take it on the chin. Asia ADOW, +0.26%  sold off in the week’s first session, with the Hang Seng HSI, +0.24%  down almost 3%. Some ugly manufacturing numbers out of China didn’t help. After markets closed, Moodys cut Japan’s credit rating to A1, which is only the fifth-best investment grade. The yen USDJPY, -0.25%  dropped to a seven-year low against the dollar. Then there’s the Middle East, where Saudi Arabian stocks spiraled into bear-market territory after OPEC opted not to do anything to help reverse oil’s decline. The quote of the day “There’s an advantage that Bush had that Obama doesn’t have. People thinking you’re dumb is an advantage. Obama started as a genius ... So it’s not that Obama’s disappointing. It’s just his best album might have been his first album.” — Chris Rock, in an interview in New York Magazine. Getty The economy The November jobs report is the one to watch this week, but we won’t get that until the end of the week. In the meantime, the ISM manufacturing index will hit this morning at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. Then, on Tuesday, auto makers will post their sales figures for last month. Check out this week’s preview of all the action on the economic front. Cyber Monday is here, and if it’s anything like Black Friday, another rough run for retailers is in store. Shoppers spent 11% less over the Thanksgiving weekend, making for a second straight annual decline, according to the National Retail Federation. Drilling down shows that shoppers spent an average of $380.95, down 6.4% from $407.02 a year earlier. The buzz OPEC’s move not to curb supply absolutely blasted shale stocks in Friday’s short session. Keep an eye out for any kind of dead-cat bounce from EP Energy EPE, -3.36%  and Oasis Petroleum OAS, -2.53%  after shares of both companies lost more than a quarter of their value the day after Thanksgiving. Exxon Mobil XOM, -2.18%  didn’t take the news well, either, losing more than 4%. The stock is on the mend this morning. Somewhat. Pimco has lost $100 billion in assets so far this year, according to data cited by the Financial Times. In fact, Pimco has accounted for half of the 10 funds with the biggest outflows so far this year. The company said withdrawals have curtailed dramatically since Bill Gross left, however. Then there’s David Einhorn and his Greenlight Capital hedge fund, which turned in a 5.8% rally in November to dwarf the 2.5% return on the S&P, Bloomberg reported. That’s good news for a $10 billion fund that’s failed to keep pace with the broader market since the beginning of the year. The chart of the day In keeping with the prevailing theme, Cam Hui of the Humble Student of the Markets blog has his eye on a potential contrarian play from the oil patch. Suncor SU, -1.94% is about to enter the Warren Buffett Zone, where the legendary investor picked up a large stake last year. “For contrarian value investors, this could be a rare opportunity to step up and buy at depressed prices,” he said. Hui also pointed to Exxon as entering the same alluring levels. “It is said that value-oriented contrarians buy when blood is running in the streets,” he said. “Is there enough blood in the streets yet? What would Warren Buffett do?” Cam Hui The call of the day Sorry to those cheering the thought of another Clinton in the White House (my wife), but Hillary probably won’t be running for president in 2016, according to Charlie Cook, the longtime nonpartisan author of the Cook Political Report. He said she has only a 25% to 30% chance of campaigning for the big gig because she is either “rusty” or “has lost her fastball” based on what he has seen on her book tour. Cook’s comments were reported in the Kansas City Star. The respected political expert also said Jeb Bush doesn’t have much of a chance of gaining the Republican nomination. Update: The Kansas City Star corrected its story on Monday morning, pointing out that Cook actually said Clinton has a 25% to 30% chance of NOT running.

OAS,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- Shares of shale-oil producers continued to get pounded in premarket trade Monday, as crude oil prices extend their slide to multiyear lows. Among the hardest-hit stocks ahead of the open, Clayton Williams Energy's CWEI, +0.00% tumbled 11%, on the heels a 26% plunge on Friday. Goodrich Petroleum's stock GDP, -1.46% slumped 6.6%, putting it on track to open at the lowest price since January 2004.

OAS,"Hulbert Financial Digest, The Wall Street Journal (The following is a complimentary article from MarketWatch’s premium newsletters. For information on Mark Hulbert’s insightful commentary, including an analysis of over 500 portfolios, please click here.) Just how hard is it to beat the market over the long haul? Back in 1980, the Hulbert Financial Digest began monitoring investment newsletters, with an initial group of 36. Two-thirds have gone out of business, many following poor performance. Of the 12 survivors, just three have topped the S&P 500’s 11.7% annualized return, including dividends. They are the Prudent Speculator, edited by John Buckingham; NoLoad FundX, edited by Janet Brown; and the Value Line Investment Survey, published by investment-research firm Value Line. Though they share long-term market-beating status, their investment approaches couldn’t be more different. Buckingham favors so-called value stocks — those trading for relatively low prices compared with their earnings or underlying net worth. He seeks to buy low and sell high, all the while holding stocks for many years. World Chess Champion Plays (and Beats) A WSJ Reporter in Seconds In contrast, Value Line’s strategy is to buy high and sell even higher. Value Line favors stocks that already are growing faster than the market, and it rarely holds them for even a year. Finally, NoLoad FundX ignores individual stocks altogether in favor of no-load mutual funds, which Brown uses to pursue a short-term trading strategy. That such disparate approaches can each beat the market over such a long period shows that there is more than one road to riches. Still, given that there are so few advisers who have beaten the market over 34 years, it also is clear — as if we needed more evidence — that beating the market is exceedingly difficult. A third investment lesson also can be drawn from these results, according to Buckingham, who became the service’s director of research in 1990: the importance of discipline and patience. That is because no investment approach always works, and because constant second-guessing is a losing strategy. Borrowing a phrase from Warren Buffett, Buckingham said, “The markets are designed to transfer money from the active to the patient.” The need for patience is especially evident in how often these top performers trailed the broad market over shorter-term periods. For example, each of the three winners lagged behind the S&P 500 in more than half of the five-year periods since 1980. Similarly, only a fraction of stock mutual funds have beaten the market over the past 34 years. And each of them has lagged behind the market during a significant proportion of shorter periods along the way, according to research conducted by Brandes Investment Partners, a San Diego-based money-management firm with $27 billion in assets. It nevertheless is the rare investor who is willing to stick with a strategy after five years of market-lagging performance. Brown says that “the best thing we can do is help investors weather the storm. Of course, there will be pullbacks. Investors need a system, one that has a proven long-term record, so they can remind themselves that we have been through this before.” None of the top three performers is expecting any pullback for the remainder of 2014. Harvey Katz, chief economist at Value Line and managing editor of the Value Line Investment Survey, says his firm is “fairly sanguine” about the market’s outlook for the next six months, given that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to raise interest rates until 2015, at the earliest, with the economy doing well, on balance, and with valuations “high, but not excessive.” Brown, who in 1997 took over her newsletter’s management from its founder, Burton Berry, agrees, adding that “most investors are underinvested in equities” right now. Another positive factor, according to Buckingham, is “the lack of grand euphoria for stocks despite the numerous record highs that have been hit this year.” Buckingham recommends building a broadly diversified portfolio of at least 50 undervalued stocks, based on measures such as the ratio of price to earnings and book value, a measure of net worth. He says he finds it difficult to draw attention to just a couple of them, since “I love all my children equally.” But he did cite three stocks that he calls “undervalued dividend payers that have yet to have their day in the sun”: Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold FCX, -2.13% a mining company; pet foods and supplies retailer PetSmart US:PETM ; and even technology giant International Business Machines IBM, -1.96% which has fallen 15% since its peak in May 2013. Value Line’s focus is on stocks whose earnings and prices have recently been growing faster than the market. Because the firm is willing to sell a stock at the first sign of its losing that momentum, it trades far more often than Buckingham does. Three firms that its stock-ranking system gave a top rating to this past week are cable company Charter Communications CHTR, -3.17% electric utility Great Plains Energy GXP, -1.54%  and Oasis Petroleum OAS, -2.96% an oil-and-gas company. Brown’s approach favors those diversified no-load mutual funds that have performed the best in recent months, relative to the market and to specific sectors. Like Value Line, she sells her holdings whenever any of them begins to lose momentum. She especially likes three funds right now, two growth-oriented and one international. The two growth funds are Janus Contrarian JSVAX, +1.51% with a 0.68% expense ratio, or $68 per $10,000 invested, and the Guggenheim S&P 500 Pure Growth RPG, -2.58%  exchange traded fund, which charges 0.50%. The international fund is Dodge & Cox International DODFX, +0.69% which charges fees of 0.64%. Mark Hulbert is editor of the Hulbert Financial Digest, which is owned by MarketWatch/Dow Jones.

OAS,"Hedge funds used to outperform the market because they managed small amounts of money and invested in their best ideas. As hedge funds' assets under management skyrocketed — thanks to their strong risk-adjusted returns — they started investing in large-cap stocks where nobody really has a huge advantage over other investors. The truth is, hedge funds cannot generate enough alpha in the large-cap space to justify their 2 and 20 fee structure, yet they have been allocating larger amounts of money to these stocks because they really have nowhere else to put it. Hedge funds still generate amazing returns in their small-cap investments. Insider Monkey developed a small-cap stock-picking strategy that invests in the 15 best small-cap ideas every quarter and this strategy returned 88% over the last 19 months (see the details here). To be clear, these are forward-tested results. We believe investors should avoid large-cap stocks and focus on billionaire investors' small-cap picks. John Paulson started his hedge fund, Paulson & Co., in 1994 using a merger arbitrage strategy. His strength lies in big macro bets, such as his famous short on subprime mortgage securities during the financial crisis. Here, we will explore his top small cap stock holdings (with market caps between $1 and $5 billion) within his $20 billion equity portfolio. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Co. HMHC, -6.12% is Paulson's largest small cap holding, with his 30.9 million shares worth $524 million. His investment in the $2.9 billion market cap education solutions provider, which makes him the largest shareholder, was a new one during the fourth quarter of 2013. Other investors with a bullish view on the stock include Geoffrey Raynor of Q Investments (Spector Holdings), Marc Lasry of Avenue Capital and Kevin Ulrich of Anchorage Advisors. Paulson's second largest small cap stock holding is Cablevision Systems Corp. US:CVC with a 21.0 million share position valued at $377 million. His 7.8% stake in the $4.8 billion market cap cable system operator makes him its fifth largest shareholder overall, joining other bullish investors such as Casey Gard of Calypso Capital Management, Richard Patton of Courage Capital and Eric Semier of TCS Capital Management. Third on the list is Oasis Petroleum Inc. OAS, -2.96% with Paulson's 7.4 million shares worth approximately $348 million. He increased his stake in the $4.4 billion market cap independent oil and natural gas E&P (exploration and production) company more than seven-fold during the fourth quarter. Other shareholders include Vince Maddi and Shawn Brennan of SIR Capital Management, Paul Jasinkiewicz of Jasinkiewicz Capital Management and Anthony Giammalva of Sound Energy Partners. Mallinckrodt PLC MNK, -5.04% is Paulson's fourth largest small cap stock position, with a 5.6 million share stake valued at $295 million. The Dublin-based pharmaceutical company, with a market cap of $3.7 billion, has been in his portfolio since the third quarter of 2013. Other hedge fund managers who own the stock include Alex Denner of Sarissa Capital Management, Stephen Dubois of Camber Capital Management and Roberto Mignone of Bridger Management. Paulson's fifth largest small cap holding is Kodiak Oil and Gas Corp. US:KOG in which he owns 26.0 million shares worth approximately $291 million. He is the largest shareholder of the $3.4 billion market cap company, which is engaged in the acquisition, exploration, exploitation, development and production of crude oil and natural gas in the Rocky Mountain region. Other hedge fund managers that own the stock include Ken Griffin of Citadel Investment Group, Israel Englander of Millennium Management and Phill Gross and Robert Atchinson of Adage Capital Management.

OAS,"Since early 2012 , I have been recommending oil-exploration-and-production (E&P) and oil-services stocks. In particular, I was very high on stocks from the Williston Basin in North Dakota. Having gone to the region three times in the summer of 2012, my conviction that several companies operating there would be big winners was fortified. Those feelings ended up being justified, but it may be time to scale back a bit. In How to play the Bakken boom, I featured seven companies that have all done very well since, none up less than 50%. Among the companies were five E&Ps, including large-cap Continental Resources CLR, -3.41% midcaps Whiting Petroleum WLL, -4.14% Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.02%  and Kodiak Oil & Gas US:KOG  and small cap Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -12.14% Currently, conditions for continued appreciation are strained. This week we saw that oil prices are on the decline as inventory has risen. I have discussed the likely path for supply before. As companies have de-risked the various unconventional oil fields and become even more efficient at drilling, supply was likely to get ahead of demand, at least for a short period. This is now happening. With this week's disappointing employment report, there is reason to believe that demand is even less strong that anticipated due to the general economic weakness. The fact that household income continues to languish is also a very significant concern. I am anticipating a fairly significant retracement of oil company stocks across the board, likely about a third of the past two year's gains. While this next point might seem obvious, the companies that are the most highly leveraged are the most vulnerable to deeper corrections. One of those companies is likely to be Kodiak Oil & Gas, which despite its impressive efficiency, does have a more vulnerable balance sheet. If oil prices fall into the $70s or hold lower prices past summer, the correction would get very deep, perhaps retracing all the past two years’ gains. The Fed's impact on oil prices is an interesting one. Should the Fed not taper anytime soon, or potentially ramp up quantitative easing in response to economic weakness, then nominal values of oil and oil company stocks would find support. The problem, of course, is that would in turn hamper economic growth by making essentials more expensive. If the Fed does taper, then a slightly stronger dollar would likely drive oil and oil company stocks down even further. This rationale applies to most financial assets of course. What we are seeing today is a growing trade-off between asset price gains and standard of living. I discussed this more in-depth here a month ago. The longer we do not normalize monetary policy, the higher asset prices will go, but the eventual hangover will be a doozy. While the government is reporting very low inflation, it is apparent that inflation in many necessities is understated. It will be interesting to see what happens over the next few quarters and years. In glancing at charts and trading volume, and remembering a slew of recommendations from late-to-the-party analysts this past summer, it is apparent that the guessers and those with little foresight have jumped on board for the end of this ride up. That is probably unfortunate for them. The only thing that will save them is another round of asset price inflating quantitative easing taking precedence over the long-term value of the dollar. In the long run, American oil will continue to rise, eventually to the point where the U.S. is free from OPEC, which will be a positive economic driver. Already we see the positive export picture in distillates developing, as export of distillates has roughly doubled in the past five years. That trend is intact long-term due to our refining capability and crude oil supplies from the U.S. and Canada. Ultimately, we do want to be in the oil company stocks, however, for now, I am willing to largely trade out and look for another opportunity due to all the short-term uncertainty. Over the past few weeks, my subscribers, clients and I have lightened up on oil company holdings by selling our appreciated value and writing covered calls. We have also been looking to sell cash-secured puts, so far only Triangle has executed. Kirk and clients of Bluemound own shares of Oasis Petroleum, Kodiak Oil and Gas, Triangle Petroleum and have sold puts on Triangle Petroleum.

OAS,"Before I sound completely Austrian with my economic thoughts, I want to point out that in my last article, Fed can't fix demographics, I stated that I was in favor of the Federal Reserve's first two rounds of quantitative easing in order to prevent a deflationary spiral. After last week's decision not to taper, however, I am very worried that most Americans’ standard of living will continue to stagnate. For the investor, the Fed's inaction is also a harbinger of worse days to come. We learned recently that Americans’ income adjusted for inflation since 1999 is down about $5000 per year on average. Clearly, in an era when politicians talk about wanting to see higher aggregate demand, having most Americans earning less does not help that cause. Last week in an interview. Marc Faber of the ""Gloom, Boom and Doom Report"" discussed that the Fed's actions are likely only helping 3%-5% of the population. I have put that number at about 2%. While low interest rates might seem attractive to consumers, the reality is that the accompanying weaker dollar has inflated home prices, as well as other prices, negating the low interest rates. What the weaker dollar directly impacts is increasing the costs of necessities. So here is the scenario I am most concerned with, and fairly convinced will occur: that most Americans continue to need more of their money for necessities, such as food and energy. If that is the case, beyond worrying about social issues, as investors, we must seriously consider what to be invested in as corporations see tightening margins. We already know that profit growth in most sectors has slowed this year. According to Morningstar, the consumer-cyclical-stock sector has returned 41% the past year and has an average return of 17% the past five — both tops among sectors. While consumer stocks have done very well since the financial crisis due to low interest rates, one must ask, ""How long can that can last?"" We know that consumer non-housing debt has surpassed 2007 levels, despite lower household incomes. How did that happen? Could it be that rent is cheaper than a mortgage and many people who are renting are nowhere near being able, or possibly even wanting, to buy houses? It certainly appears that millions are simply continuing to deficit spend on consumables and giving up on saving to buy homes. That is a terrible trend. Consider that with much of the housing-market rebound being driven by investors and no real line forming for those homes by new owner occupants, how that scenario might end. FRED I have spent quite a bit of time discussing this on MarketWatch in 2012, and in my newsletter this year, that there is a very high probability that soon, only one investment thesis will work. That thesis is to be long commodity and resource investments, as well as, short almost everything else, in particular, companies with profits that rely on American consumer-discretionary spending. We also know that the energy sector has been one of the worst performing the past five years, despite pockets of gains in the past year. Among the winners are Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -12.14% Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.58%  and Kodiak Oil and Gas US:KOG three Bakken shale-oil companies I discussed last year here and here. In the past year, as I predicted, each company has increased production and improved their financial position. All three companies sit on acreage that not only positions them well for further growth, but makes them potential takeover targets as the majors look for reserves. If we get more inflationary pressure, companies like the North Dakota-focused oil companies could do extremely well. In the short run, however, oil futures are in backwardation and predicting that the odds of an economic slowdown have increased, therefore, I am waiting for a pullback to buy more shares. For those without exposure to the North Dakota oil players, selling cash-secured puts can generate income for accounts and set a lower potential purchase price. Last week in my newsletter, I recommended selling the Triangle January $10 puts with a $1 limit. This generates a 10% gain should the stock, currently trading around $9.75, be over $10 come January. If the stock is below $10, the net purchase price for the put seller is only $9, which means they are buying 7.6% cheaper than today's price. Interestingly, even in a stronger-dollar environment, oil stocks should do very well if allowed to. The Bakken companies are key to our coming energy self-sufficiency, and the U.S. will export even more distillates in the western hemisphere as Central and South American economies develop. In short, regardless of which way the Fed or the dollar goes, I am strongly advising you again to look for opportunities to buy the Bakken/Three Forks exploration and production companies. Kirk and clients of Bluemound own shares of Oasis Petroleum, Kodiak Oil and Gas, Triangle Petroleum and have sold puts on Triangle Petroleum.

OAS,"Oasis Petroleum Inc.'s OAS, -3.09% second-quarter earnings fell 12% as the oil and gas producer recorded fewer derivatives-related gains, masking strong revenue and production growth. The company, which focuses on lightly developed assets in the Williston Basin around Montana and North Dakota, has reported sharply higher production in recent quarters, with oil representing the vast majority of its output. However, the derivatives impacts frequently have affected the company's bottom line. Oasis Petroleum reported a profit of $67.1 million, or 72 cents a share, down from $76 million, or 82 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest period included derivatives-related gains of $12.6 million, while the year-earlier period included gains of $74.6 million. Excluding derivatives impacts and other items, adjusted earnings were 65 cents, up from 33 cents a share. Revenue surged 71% to $254.6 million. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters recently expected per-share profit of 60 cents and revenue of $246 million. Oil revenue, which makes up the bulk of the top line, climbed 64% to $226.8 million. Average selling prices for oil, before hedging impacts, were up 11%. Average daily production climbed 48% to 30,171 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Shares closed Tuesday at $42.93 and weren't actively trading after-hours. Through the close, the stock is up 35% this year.

OAS,"Typically, Trading Deck articles focus on trades and investments that can be made in a brokerage account. However, on many occasions folks have commented on articles and emailed me asking what to do with their 401(k) balances which can generally only be invested in mutual funds. The first thing I respond with is to consider that your 401(k) or similar retirement plan, such as a 403(b) or 457 deferred compensation plan, is such a core piece of your retirement that you ought to not be particularly aggressive in the plan. In the “Intelligent Investor” by Benjamin Graham — Warren Buffett's mentor — suggests a 50/50 asset allocation between stocks and fixed-income as a baseline which swings between 75/25 and 25/75 depending on market conditions. Right now, I think moving to about 50/50 from wherever you are is a good idea. With all of the government stimulus and potentially more coming, you want something in the stock markets. However, some stock markets, including in the United States, are a bit overbought and have rallied quite a bit this year, which might mean we are do for a correction. I, of course, do not like most bond funds, so be careful in selecting, I'd suggest funds that have flexibility in currency and/or is short-term in duration. The charts are very ambiguous. We could just as easily see a 30% rally or correction over the next year. If we see the correction, folks ought to move from 50/50 stocks to fixed income to 75/25 stocks to fixed-income. If we see a further extension of gains, participants ought to move to a 25/75 mix. The percentages are approximate of course, but in general work without much splitting of hairs. For many plan participants, they should double-check with their plan administrator whether they have a self-directed brokerage option for their account. Many plans now have that option which allows participants to move much or all of their balance to a self-directed brokerage account. In those cases, a much larger world of investment options opens up. If your plan does not offer a self-directed option, you might want to ask for one and see what happens. Let your employer know that you'd like to invest in the biggest boom in America, Bakken oil stocks, like Oasis Petroleum OAS, -4.26% Kodiak Oil and Gas US:KOG  and Continental Resources CLR, -4.21%  with some of your 401(k) money. Maybe dropping the tip will prod them on. Probably not though. Other plans allow a non-hardship withdrawal at age 59 1/2. For folks closing in on retirement, they might be able to roll some or all of their 401(k) balance into an IRA. This again allows for greater control. These next two bits of advice are a bit controversial, but for many folks, reducing their 401(k) contributions makes a lot of sense. If you do not have a match or self-directed option, using an IRA ahead of a 401(k), 403(b) or 457 will give you greater freedom of choice on your retirement investments. Many others should also consider buying real estate if you are over a decade away from retirement. That might be your best investment over the next 15 years or so. I have suggested to several clients who have the stomach, skills and money, that they slow down their qualified plan contributions and take advantage of this historic opportunity in real estate to buy cheap and with low-interest rates.

OAS,"NEW YORK (MarketWatch) — QEP Resources moved up 6% Friday as a top leader among components in the S&P 500 index, gaining as the company moved to buy acreage in the Bakken shale for $1.4 billion, while the broad energy sector reversed course and rose to reduce losses for the week. Meanwhile, BP BP, -1.97%  and Royal Dutch Shell RDS.A, -2.02%  moved to pull staff from the Gulf of Mexico as Tropical Storm Isaac approached the region. See story on Isaac. Flush with increased production to result after the deal closes as expected on Sept. 27, QEP Resources QEP, -3.17% lifted its 2012 target for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization on an adjusted basis to a range of $1.4 billion to $1.45 billion, up from a prior estimate of $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion. Morgan Stanley Bets Big on Facebook At closing bell, QEP shares rose $1.62 to $28.80, their highest level since last month. “The acquisition will add a new contiguous block of QEP-operated acreage in a localized ‘sweet spot’ for both the Bakken and Three Forks formations, as evidenced by above average well performance and estimated ultimate recovery from wells drilled to-date in both reservoirs,” said QEP CEO Chuck Stanley. “The acquisition meets our criteria perfectly.” The acquisition of acreage from Black Hills Corp. BHK, -0.15%  and Unit Corp. UNT, -7.64%  also stoked speculation for other deals. Gabriele Sorbara of Imperial Capital said “pure-play Bakken players” should be regarded as acquisition candidates. Oasis Petroleum OAS, -4.32%  and Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -12.14%  appear to be among the most attractive candidates for prospective buyouts, Sorbara said. Shares of Oasis rose 1.8% and Triangle Petroleum moved up by 4.1%. Among big-cap energy stocks, Exxon Mobil XOM, -2.64%  rose 0.9% and Chevron Corp. CVX, -2.31%  rose 0.7%.

OAS,"""Cycles of shortage and surplus characterize the entire history of oil."" -- Daniel Yergin Right now a potential shortage of oil exists in the eyes of many investors. As a result, the price of oil is moving up aggressively off of its recent bottom. We see here in the WTI October future's contract that a breakout appears likely as shorter weekly averages cross longer on the way up. Some of the popular reasons given for this breakout are: A potential attack of Iran by Israel The Nigerian oil workers strike Potential Chinese stimulation Potential American stimulation Oil companies (generally American) deliberately slowing production At this point, I don't really care what the reasons are. I have said repeatedly that oil would push higher despite new reserves becoming available. What is going on now is just one of what will be a series of fits and bursts we will see in the volatile long-term ebb and flow that gradually moves oil prices up over time. In my last article, ""Using Balanced Alternatives During Uncertainty,"" I discussed generally how we are preparing for inflation in our portfolios. One move, which I have discussed in several MarketWatch columns, is using the Williston Basin oil E&Ps to play the next pop in oil prices. That move is just underway now. Take a look at the weekly chart of tiny Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -12.14%   which I recently talked about here, and the move that this minor producer is making. Also look at Oasis Petroleum OAS, -4.20%  and Kodiak Oil and Gas KOG, -2.43%  in the mid-sized category, as well as bigger companies such as Whiting Petroleum WLL, -4.82%  or Continental Resources CLR, -4.34% All of these companies are just confirming their moves. It is not unlikely that these moves last another month to three months with these sorts of confirmations. All five of these companies are worthy long-term investments, however, given the amount of fear in the market, there is another move. As I have discussed before, and continue to do myself, selling cash-secured puts is a great way to generate income for an account and keep a margin of safety greater than being directly invested in stock. Due to the volatile nature of oil and the current high levels of fear in general, put premiums are very generous. Kodiak's December $8 put today traded at about .80 yielding a 10% premium income for a four-month commitment of cash (or margin if you are daring). In order to be in the red on that trade, Kodiak would have to trade down to $7.20, or drop about 20%. If you are still afraid of the end of the world, then an addendum to this trade can be made. In addition to selling the December $8 put, buy the December $5 put, where there is strong support for Kodiak, for .20. On net, you make .60 against a commitment of keeping $8 in cash for four months. That is a 7.5% gain. How would that be two or three times a year? What about even once if you were taking little risk the rest of the year? Similar trades can be made throughout the group of companies mentioned above, including Triangle, which is on pace to increase revenue 500% by the end of 2013. Given the decreasing nature of expenses and increasing revenues in the Williston, all of these companies offer quite a bit of upside intermediate term, even if you end up owning a few, like I do. Other put selling opportunities are out there as well, however, small- to mid-size oil companies seem like the no-brainer now. Either you win in the short-run, or you end up owning good growing companies at a net cost of around 15%-20% below today's prices, that you can hold for the intermediate term. If you have followed my writings, you know I don't make a lot of bets and move slowly. I believe in something I heard Mark Cuban say, and I paraphrase, ""when you find something that works well, keep doing it until it doesn't work anymore."" Selling cash-secured puts on oil companies, except after large moves up, has worked for a few years now, I expect it will for a little while longer at least.

OAS,"""If wealth or real GDP was only being created at an annual rate of 3.5% over the same period of time, then somehow stockholders must be skimming 3% off the top each and every year."" Bill Gross Right. The opening quote from PIMCO's Bill Gross did not get all the attention of his proclamation that ""the cult of equity is dying"" did, but it probably should have. I'm not going to argue the ethics of the above statement, even though Gross implies the 3% is morally wrong by his use of the word skim. Rather, I just think it is a statement of fact that stock investors will in general do better on a percentage basis than labor or bond investors. As Gross notes in his recent letter, real wages have fallen the past 40 years. During that period, we experienced a massive stock market boom, despite the past 12 years of trader-enriching, secular-bear-market, high-frequency-driven volatility. What is most interesting to me, though, is that the drop in real wages coincides more with the expansion of social welfare than it does with the secular bull stock market which only encompassed half of the time frame. So is it wrong that equity holders have made better returns historically than bond investors or labor? Remember, the bond market is far larger than the stock market, so equity investors are not really skimming a full 3% from the economy. What the 3% really represents, of course, is the ""risk premium"" that equity investors demand for their investment. The real question to ask is whether 3% is the appropriate premium level? But let's ask another question. What is the equity premium for a small business owner? For the successful small-business owner, it is far above 3%. Why? Because his/her personal financial risk was likely exceptionally high — unless of course he/she was a Harvard dropout working with venture capital. All of this, of course, raises the question: What next? I have argued exhaustively the past year that stocks are once again the best game in town. A little early? Maybe, but accuracy generally wins enough over time that precision is forgotten. For the record, I do not like all stocks. As Gross has implied, commodities might be the place to be during an inflationary period. I am not a big believer in commodity-linked securities, though there are some asset-backed vs. futures-backed ETFs that could be worthwhile for trading. What I do like are commodity-linked stocks. While actual commodities do well during a high-inflation period, commodity-linked stocks do well during moderate inflation. We are much more likely to see moderate inflation in America due to our (still) reserve-currency status and ability to produce our own commodities. Of course, this does presume some political brain power in the near future, such as policing cheating and hoarding, limiting foreign military deployments if possible, continuing to educate and favoring work over welfare. If we continue to get political partisanship over solutions, well, then, yes, all bets are off. I'm still with Churchill, though, and believe we will get around to doing things right. I have discussed North Dakota oil shale plays such as Kodiak Oil and Gas KOG, -2.43%  and Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.77%  as being some of the easier plays out there. There are dozens more commodity producers and servicers that should do well in a moderate inflationary period. In looking at some of PIMCO's portfolios, it is easy to see they are entering both the commodity and commodity-stock plays. My firm has followed that lead with our Balanced Alternatives strategy which takes an inflation-sensitive growth and income approach that has the advantage of being nimble in a Lynch-identified way. If you own bond funds, it is time to start swapping out for commodity-linked or commodity-stock investments. As Gross points out, bonds are in even worse shape than many stocks going forward.

OAS,"ELM GROVE, Wisc. (MarketWatch) — Bakken oil shale stocks have gotten a lot of attention online recently. Since I have written about Bakken stocks too, I recently decided to drive out to North Dakota to see first-hand what was really going on in the Williston Basin. Folks, if you haven’t seen it, you don’t know the half of it. TRADING STRATEGIES: JULY Brighter days?    • • • Let’s put a smile on your Facebook • Independent thinkers are buying banks • Shorter is better when it comes to bonds • Emerging markets may be July’s best play • The time has come for natural gas • How to play the Bakken boom • Master the possibilities of Mastercard • Range Resources powers up    China isn't the global growth engine it once was. Jeff Shen, head of the Asia-Pacific and emerging-market equity group at BlackRock tells MarketWatch's Jonathan Burton what he sees as the biggest threat to China's economy. What I saw was a legitimate boom, the type that leads to cities being built and economies being stimulated. Infrastructure upgrades including roads, telecommunications, electrical, bridges, rail lines and pipelines were apparent not only near the boom town of Williston, but throughout the region. Subdivisions are also being constructed for the tens of thousands of people moving into the area. Driving the growth is one of the best oil deposits in America. The Williston Basin is a closed system, essentially a 200,000-square-mile rock bowl filled with multiple layers of petroleum, including oil and natural gas liquids. The Bakken shale gets the most press, however, there are multiple recoverable levels, called benches, in different formations, including the Three Forks. The oil being pumped from the Williston Basin is both economical to recover and easy to refine. The Bakken oil is high-grade light sweet crude that is among the best oil on the continent, far cleaner than oil sands petroleum from Canada. The oil flows so freely in the basin that we saw many newer wells that didn’t need the help of a pump to fill storage tanks. In studying industry and state records, it appears that wells that do not produce are few and far between. This basin is largely responsible for the United States becoming an exporter of fuel in 2011 for the first time in six decades and likely an exporter again in 2012. So far, there are about 7,000 active wells in the basin, some older. The pace is picking up on drilling, as in order to hold leases, about 5,000 new wells will need to be completed in the next few years. It will take approximately 45,000 wells, which use about 4 miles of steel pipe each, to tap the basin of what is likely 10 to 20 billion barrels of oil. Drilling will go on for about a decade or slightly longer, and wells will produce for about three decades at decreasing rates. While this is not a game changer in and of itself, combined with other American oil plays and abundant natural gas reserves, it appears America’s bridge to renewable and sustainable energy is found. What is especially important about the Williston Basin is that it will be partly responsible for the United States becoming energy self-sufficient, as Continental Resources CEO Harold Hamm calls it. In the next few years, America will be able to reduce OPEC’s contributions to our petroleum supply to a few percent of total supply. Hamm’s analysis jives with a report put out by Goldman Sachs late in 2011. This energy self-sufficiency will obviously do wonders for America (see my letter “Freedom From OPEC“ at www.KirkSpano.com), as we will not be beholden to less friendly or difficult foreign nations for the oil that we use for the first time in decades. A better supply ought to keep prices down at the pump and our military commitments will likely reduce. Already, we have largely left Iraq to the Chinese to worry about, as China has won most of the oil field contracts there. Most importantly for American competitiveness, is that our energy costs, due to both oil and gas production at home, will be lower than nations we had been exporting jobs to the past few decades. That will give incentive for companies to move jobs back to America. As those jobs come back over the rest of the decade, what I have called the “halo effect” will take hold. Other industries will thrive (remember all that steel used per well), pushing unemployment down and creating a virtuous economic cycle. For the investor, some of the smaller oil companies appear very worthy of investment. I have profiled and discussed Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.58% Kodiak Oil and Gas KOG, -2.43%  and Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -11.43%  on the Trading Deck, and each is a buy right now in my opinion given the recent drop in oil prices and negative market sentiment. For those three companies, I have been using a mixed strategy of selling puts, buying stock and buying calls. Continental Resources CLR, -3.60%  and Whiting WLL, -4.08%  are larger oil companies that also present interesting opportunities on share price pullbacks. Oil services companies, such as Halliburton HAL, -2.83%  and Flotek FTK, -4.26%  are also seeing growth worth consideration for investment. Companies in industries once removed from oil, such as in steel, railroad and trucking are also worthy of research. Regardless of where you decide your best stock (or business or employment) opportunities are, this is a real boom in America, and it can make you money.

OAS,"I never attempt to make money on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years. —Warren Buffett In 2011, if you had an equity portfolio and left it alone all year, presuming you did not make any terrible mistakes, not trading was a great idea. While you would have hovered around zero return, you would not have gotten clobbered like so many traders and hedge funds did. 2012 is proving to be much the same as 2011; bouts of volatility, but not much overall movement, although I maintain that very well could change for the positive soon. What we know about trading is that there are very few winners. While the best traders make a lot of money by beating most of the others (a lot like poker), there are almost no retail investors among the winners. If you must trade, taking a slow-hand position-trading approach with companies and sectors that you have fundamentally qualified is probably the way to go. Position trading is seeking to catch major moves over an extended period of time from a particular company or sector. Unlike active traders who are looking to move in an out frequently, a position trader who uses fundamental analysis in selecting companies and sectors will trade infrequently, only trading out when the major move has ended or market conditions become extreme. Today, investors who are stuck in cash or bonds have a great chance to start fundamentally choosing stocks and sectors to buy and hold for a pretty long time. As Buffett has also said, ""You do things when the opportunities come along. I've had periods in my life when I've had a bundle of ideas come along, and I've had long dry spells. If I get an idea next week, I'll do something. If not, I won't do a damn thing."" Right now, I have a bundle of ideas. As those who have followed my articles the past eight months know, I have a pretty simple thesis: An economic collapse is not imminent, the world economy already collapsed (2007-09, in case you missed it). What is going on now is the slow, painful, disgustingly frustrating and labored re-birth of the global economy. The world is not done growing by simple virtue of the fact that there are billions of people who want better standards of living. Scarcity will increase over the next two to three decades until sustainability models and alternative energy take hold. Europe will gradually pull through (I'm tired of using the word ""muddle"" because so many people have adopted it) in an ugly, but fairly brilliant way, as they save the euro from attack by speculators and those motivated to blow it up for other reasons. The United States will eventually do things right after trying almost everything else. America is poised to boom as she is flush with many of the necessities of life, i.e. food and natural resources; strong in manufacturing high-end goods, i.e. machinery, medicine and technology; strong in skilled services, and very importantly, has a new large generation about to hit the workforce. While rampant pessimism and fear exists among investors lamenting the past 12 years, that simply makes it a good, and maybe great, time to invest in stocks. The neat thing about mass investor psychology is that it offers some wonderful opportunities to go against the grain. My best ideas, which I have written about repeatedly, and do again in the Trading Strategies section next week, continue to be small and mid-size oil companies and oil services companies with operations in the Williston Basin. I have already discussed Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.58% Kodiak Oil and Gas KOG, -2.43%  and Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -11.43% All of these are buys as they have been severely beaten the past several months and are just starting to reverse. Also, in my ""best"" universe, is Exact Sciences EXAS, -2.06% which is still speculative due to being in a Phase III FDA clinical trial, but by virtue of being up hundreds of percent for me, qualifies as a best idea I suppose by definition of the word best. I have a host of other ideas, which I have written about here and elsewhere, including today posting the mid-year summary of my firm's core holdings. What are your best ideas? If you don't know, it's time start looking forward again, building a fundamentally strong list and stop looking backward — you can't change the past anyway.

OAS,"""Go west, young man."" — Horace Greeley Today I drove about 700 miles from my suburban Milwaukee home to Jamestown, North Dakota. I'm about three hours from Minot, where on Thursday morning, I will meet up with Bob Walstad of Integrity Viking Funds and co-manager of the Williston Basin Mid-North America Stock Fund ICPAX, +2.46% before setting out for a guided tour of the oil patch. One of the things I've learned so far is that Jamestown, which is a sleepy little town when Jamestown College is out, is very difficult to get a hotel room in, despite being five hours from the City of Williston, the epicenter of the oil boom in North Dakota. As told by several hotel personal, men working in the oil industry, are sharing the rooms in shifts and from week to week depending on who is working when. Intriguing to me is that there is downtown real estate still available in Jamestown, only about a mile from the college. In talking to the very sweet Cathy at the front desk, of the very comfortable Gladstone Inn & Suite's where I am staying, it is apparent that Jamestown is going through some changes. Located along Interstate 94, within a few hours of a major oil boom, a few other nearby job catalysts and with a charming downtown, the Buffalo City appears to be a town on the come. While eating dinner at Grizzley's, I had the opportunity to talk to a few truckers. Each of them made the point that Williston was a little wild right now, but that the money was flowing. One gentleman hauled fracking mud from Michigan, which he described as being used to water proof the piping used in the drilling process. He was quite knowledgeable about the process and believed that, from an environmental standpoint, the drilling companies were being very diligent about protecting the ground water, if nothing else to protect their golden goose. The bartender described the flow of people moving through the area as being very regular and was good enough to warn me about one of the nearby restaurants. She was pretty sure her home had gone up in value in the past couple of years as well, which is saying a lot in America recently. She was also quite good at putting a head on my pint of Fat Tire beer. I have prepared a list of questions from Mr. Walstad about what we are going to see, which should be several drilling sites, including for Whitting Petroleum WLL, -4.20% Kodiak Oil and Gas KOG, -2.43% Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.70% and Continental Resources CLR, -3.68% In talking to him a few times by telephone now, it won't take a lot of prodding from me to get a lot of great information. He is a virtual encyclopedia of knowledge about what is going on in the oil industry and the Williston Basin in particular. I am going to keep this column short as I've had a long day, but want to remind people that what is going on in North Dakota is a big deal. I have written several columns about it now and will write several more, including one for Monday. The companies involved in the Williston and the companies serving those companies, are some of the most compelling growth opportunities in America. The halo effect is significant. Consider, it takes about four miles of steel piping to complete one well, and that there are projected to be thousands of new wells over the next few years. On this trip, I am not only looking to gain even greater insight into companies I already own, but to find a few more to buy. Already, these companies are finding their way into several of my firm's investment strategies because these companies offer not only growth, but because of the options that are available, offer some very interesting positive asymmetric opportunities.

OAS,"Tonight, I was watching the last episode of House and had no intention of writing, but the show helped me clarify something that had been on my mind the past few months. I have been wondering, painfully trying to figure out really, what the baby boomers, who are so damaged by their experience in the stock market the past 12 years, are going to do now? I wonder about that for two reasons. Second, because the answer is central to whether stock markets lead the economic recovery that I believe is just beginning or trail it for the rest of this decade, before the time when Generation Y starts investing enough money to make an impact. First, however, I wonder how the baby boomers are ever going to afford an enjoyable retirement if they don't put more of their money back into stocks? Michael Gayed has been talking about how he expects a switch from fixed income into stocks. His logic is hard to dispute. I have been thinking the same thing, logically. However, there is something more to it than the logic that bonds are near all-time high prices and stocks are at worst fairly valued as a class. That thing, is emotion. People are deathly afraid that they will lose money in the stock market the next decade and harm their retirement. The problem with that line of reasoning for most boomers however is that they are already behind the eight ball in regard to retirement. Consider your study of choice, the baby boomers are woefully short on retirement savings and pensions. The boomers who do have six-figure portfolios are worried they might lose tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars if they invest in the stock market again. They are afraid of the wrong bogeyman however. Inflation is coming. In fact, inflation in necessities is already here. That type of inflation, though, is central to the boom that I forecast for America as an exporter of food, energy, high-end machinery, medicine and technology. Unfortunately, baby boomers won't participate in the upside of America as a growth export economy again if they are not invested in stocks, because they are working less by the day as a group and can't count on wages. They, in fact, will suffer as prices, even if there is a firmer dollar as I expect, of necessities drift upward due to the effects of global scarcity on supply and demand curves. I understand the baby boomer's trepidation to buying stocks. It is very understandable and reasonable. But since most boomers are conspiracy theorists in my experience, let me toss something out there that might stir some to invest again: The very rich are buying resource and certain manufacturing, medicine and technology stocks at a time when computer-driven volatility makes it extra scary to invest. Ask why that is. You might find a motivating conspiracy theory to spur some investment. You might not find that theory though. You might just decide it’s a bunch of greedy people—some smarter or less dumb than others—along with global debt issues and coincidence that have led to the volatile markets. Whatever you decide are the reasons behind the scary, here is what I know today: The baby boomers are in bad shape financially, have had a rough go of it in the stock market the past 12 years and are afraid of stocks. America is on the verge of becoming a major food, energy, high-end machinery, medicine and technology growth export economy again due to global demand from emerging and mature economies alike. Some of the most astute investors in the world are accumulating shares in businesses that will benefit from America becoming a supplier to offset global scarcity (this should be a tip off). That the baby boomers better get over their backward looking fear of stocks. For the weary boomer, here is an investment that can be used as the warm blanket to get back into the stock market: General Electric GE, -2.37%  pays a fat dividend, has corrected it is financial problems and is a major player in energy. It is once again the slow growth income play that you can count on. For younger investors, say anybody not yet retired, look to the Williston Basin for Bakken oil shale investments. I have discussed this theme several times, so look at my article list, but I believe Williston Basin related stocks are, as a group, possibly the best opportunity on earth right now. Look at Kodiak Oil and Gas KOG, -2.43% Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.58% Flotek FTK, -3.93% and CJ Energy Services CJES, +0.00% for relatively safe opportunities to make excess returns. So, how did watching the last episode of House get me to write this? I don't know. Maybe it has something to do with renewal, making choices to live life to the fullest in our limited time here or opening oneself up to new paths of thought. Maybe my brain just slowed down watching TV. I'm sure several commentators will go with the slow brain theory.

OAS,"This column was originally headlined ""Synthetic Oil,"" which I thought was pretty clever. But after getting home Thursday night, I decided there was more to talk about. This column might drag on, so I'll try to be interesting for all of my single-serving friends. For those who have read my other pieces, I think you'll understand. In my career, the one problem I have run into consistently with investors is that most people are not really investors. Most people seeking financial advice or a financial planner are savers who are trying to keep up with inflation. There's nothing wrong with that and I can help them with what they need. Today though, I am thinking bigger than narrowly beating inflation with as low of risk as possible (the low risk is what requires skill). I am thinking about generating the sort of wealth that improves people's level of freedom, and hopefully enables some of them to do more of the good things that are in their hearts. For myself, and investors who hire me, I want to take advantage of the sort of opportunity that only comes around periodically. I want to participate in the American resource boom that I see developing. The developing boom for America will be a long, multiple-stage series of events. Each opportunity will be a little different. The first in the series, the one knocking on the door, is based upon expanding domestic oil production and fuel exports. This has already started. Production in the United States is up dramatically the past several years. In addition, in 2011, the United States exported fuel for the first time in six decades. What you see in the EIA chart above is a significant ramp up of oil (liquids) production. This increase will level off in the next decade, but between now and early next decade, the surge in production will continue. As I have discussed, many oil companies are about to see a surge in profits as well due to a growing export market for American fuel. This is a large opportunity that most ""investors"" are missing. In discussing Bakken oil companies, one strategy I touched on included using options to create a synthetic long position by selling a put and buying a call. The benefit vs. simply being long a stock is that the investor gains leverage on the position which if a catalyst materializes during the term of the call option, can generate a multiple on the position. In this type of trade, if the underlying stock falls in price during the option term, the investor buys the stock via having it put to them, presuming the put is left open. In many cases, it becomes apparent about two weeks from expiration that closing the position and cutting losses is a good idea, in which case the investor saves some money. If the stock rises, but only a bit, then the options all expire and the investor simply reloads a similar trade having lost nothing but some calendar. Four companies I am using this sort of strategy for are Kodiak Oil and Gas KOG, -2.43% Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -11.43% Northern Gas and Oil NOG, +1.26%  and Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.58% I am looking at adding Apache Corporation APA, -2.36%  now. Being able to generate a multiple on your investments is the second key to significantly outperforming the markets. The first, of course, is picking the right companies to invest in to begin with. For the investor seeking more downside protection, in case I am wrong and oil companies are about to run into hard times, utilizing protective puts will be useful. For larger accounts, paying for this sort of basic hedging will help preserve wealth in the case of hard pullback. There is little point in hedging a five-figure account however in my opinion. The costs are too high, so utilize trailing stops instead. A problem that many, if not most, people have with investment strategies is not following through. Missing on a trade, even if it was a good idea, leads too many folks to move onto something else. Often, the right approach is to try again, just like a batter who swings and misses. So long as investors mitigate losses, capital will stay intact enough to get into the batters box again and again and again until there is an extra base hit. The first batch of trades I discussed have not completed yet. Prices on the underlying stocks have fallen however, meaning that opening new positions now is more favorable than before. Investors ought to look into a synthetic long strategy as Bakken oil plays have a bright future. The Eagle Ford shale is also going to create some large winners as well. Don't neglect the oil services companies. Most of my accounts are already tilted toward participating in the developing oil boom. And while what I am doing is not completely original, most investors are still sitting in their broadly diversified portfolios essentially indexing on the not cheap and taking 100% of the market risk in doing so. I would hopefully like to wake at least some of those people up today. Here is a quote to think about: ""Wide diversification is only required when investors do not understand what they are doing."" Warren Buffett I have written two articles referencing this investing sin, here and here. The thing is, like I said, most people are not investors. That's really the crux of why so many people underperform long-term. Become an investor. Find a few good ideas and commit to them. Probably not with all of your money, but with some amount that is comfortable. With the rest, build a nice balanced, low-cost asset allocation that will beat inflation by a bit. At the beginning of the article, I mentioned the article was called ""Synthetic Oil."" Here's how I started. We all know how good synthetic oil is for certain cars. Now, using a synthetic investment strategy using options to go long on oil stocks might be just as good for your portfolio. Are you an investor? If so, focusing more on oil is a good idea and using options for a part of the strategy might make a good idea better.

OAS,"In the past month, Bakken-oil-related stocks have paused after a large autumn and early winter move up. The group continues to be under some light pressure as oil prices moderate due to fears of further global economic malaise. This is a buying opportunity. While the world economic recovery is no doubt tenuous, as I have mentioned in various other articles, I am not highly fearful of another major deflationary collapse as we saw in 2008. It is almost a certainty in my view that either the world economy keeps muddling along toward more sustained growth, or governments step in to stimulate growth. In both cases, many commodity producing companies remain attractive in general. Any short-term pullbacks are chances to buy in my view. In the Bakken oil shale play, many of the companies share prices have fallen from their early year price highs. Kodiak Oil and Gas KOG, -2.43% which continues to ramp up production, has seen its shares drop to the middle $9s off of a $10.90 high. Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.83% also ramping up production on its highly desirable acreage, is near $31 per share, down from a high of $35.46. Northern Oil and Gas NOG, +1.77% with its non-operator strategy, has fallen to the middle $19s per share from a high of $28. Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -11.43% making the transition from non-operator to operator, has slid back to $6.20 from a high of $8.40. I have covered this particular group earlier, discussing the possibility that each could be acquired by larger oil companies. I have also discussed an option strategy that looks even better now at the lower share prices. Two catalysts are at work with the Bakken group. The first has been mentioned a bit in the news already, and that is the effect of good weather in North Dakota this winter. Rig count jumped in January and February according to numbers by Baker Hughes and slightly different numbers by the Industrial Commission of North Dakota - Oil & Gas Division, to reach a new high during the usually slower winter period. With added crews for many companies, rig count will continue to increase. By the end of the year, it is expected that Bakken oil production approaches total Alaskan production. With about 99% of drilled wells hitting oil and 90% profitable, the added rigs should add to company bottom lines by the end of the year, and quite possibly sooner. Also in the news are the Seaway and Keystone oil pipelines. The Seaway is about to have a significant impact on the Bakken stocks. Beginning in late May, about 150,000 barrels of oil per day will be able to move away from Cushing, Oklahoma and make its way to Gulf refining facilities. Within two years, that capacity is planned to be 450,000 barrels. The current glut of oil in the middle of the country has suppressed oil prices for producing Bakken companies, keeping it about $10 per barrel below prevailing Cushing spot prices (though there was an oft-quoted trough price in February) and even further below international spot prices. This has made profit margins tighter than desired at some companies and led at least indirectly to a few of the smaller companies barely missing estimates in the previous quarter as their drilling expenses were higher with the new rigs. With the reversal of the Seaway pipeline almost complete, Bakken companies can look forward to receiving a price for their oil that is essentially the same as the price at Cushing, though redirected Bakken oil could have the impact of slightly lowering Cushing prices. That money will hit both the top and bottom lines fairly quickly. Another company to look at is Continental Resources CLR, -3.61% the largest Bakken producer which is run by Mitt Romney's energy advisor Harold Hamm. With more of their oil freed to make it to gulf refiners, who will export some of the refined fuel, the company stands to see a surge in profits. Currently the shares trade with a price-to-earnings ratio exceeding 30, however, the forward p/e is only about 18, which does not appear to account for higher prices on the oil they will sell at Cushing soon. It is very possible that Continental sees big beats on earnings in a coming quarter. I am considering a put-selling strategy to bring in option premiums. For the fund investor, the Integrity Williston Basin/Mid-North America Stock Fund ICPAX, +2.46%  bought at net asset value is a good way to pick up a long-term position in the group. To buy the fund without a load, an investor would need their own online brokerage account or to work with a reasonably priced fee-only advisor (I know one), and not buy through a full service broker, who will take a 5% commission on the purchase. I would expect positive surprises for quite a few Bakken oil companies during the rest of the year. Buying now, would be appropriate for the right accounts.

OAS,"Six weeks ago, I highlighted four oil exploration and production companies operating primarily in the Bakken shale play that were all potential acquisition targets. Three of these companies are up a bit, but have become rangebound recently due to a spate of higher-than-anticipated operating expenses. Here are the charts of the four companies: Kodiak Oil and Gas KOG, -2.43%   TimeTriangle Petroleum Corp.May 17Jul 17Sep 17Nov 17Jan 18Mar 18 US:TPLM $0.04 $0.06 $0.08  Northern Oil and Gas NOG, +2.02%    GAMES Week 2 results TrainingID edges out TheSugarBear by a mere 75 cents to win round two of MarketWatch's quarterly competition. Join the competition now! Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.70%   Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -11.43%   . . . . . . . . In looking at the charts, Kodiak looks like the most likely to break out. The company did experience higher-than-expected expenses in the most recent quarterly report, but a portion of that can be attributed to being ahead of schedule in drilling due to mild weather in December. The company is trading at about a forward P/E of 8, and if it ramps drilling a bit faster than lowered expectations, it could see its share price surge. Oasis is looking pretty good technically, too, potentially coming out of a pivot up, off a double bottom. It reported good earnings and outlooks a couple of weeks ago and is ramping revenue quickly. With very experienced management, it is hard to see this company not doing well. Triangle's chart is ambiguous at this point in my opinion, but I think the company might be the most ripe for a takeover based upon its size and other factors. If they get their new wells into operation before the stated summer anticipation dates, these shares could jump. Given the mild winter and clear focus on the North Dakota part of their portfolio over the less-proven Montana portion, I think it is likely the new wells produce sooner than expected or at least on time. The company is weirdly debt-free to boot. Northern is the weakest in the bunch technically, trending down. Catching this gently falling knife might produce big gains if done well. However, given the volatility of oil stocks, you could get cut as well. Given Northern's partnership strategy, I don't see their weakness lasting long. The question is how to take a position. I am using a basket approach to these companies by owning some stock and holding some bullish and neutral option positions. The option strategy I am using is fairly simple. I am selling puts and buying calls with the collected premiums. My downside is that I will potentially have to buy some stock in companies that I like at a little less net cost than today's price later in the year. My upside is that I capture amplified gains if there is a surge in these particular oil stocks. Kodiak puts with a $10 strike price (about today's share price) have a bid of $1.45. Selling those generates $1.45 per share in premium. An investor’s obligation is that you may have to buy the stock at $10 between now and the third Friday in September. Using the $1.05 of the put premium collected to buy June $10 calls, an investor would still have a net .40 per share in their account and get the upside of the June calls. For example, if Kodiak rises to $15 between now and June, the investor will be able to sell those calls for $5 (plus any time value that is left), far in excess of the 50% gain if the stock were simply bought. If the stock is under $10 come September, an investor could buy the stock for a net cost of $9.60, which is the $10 strike price minus the 40¢ premium held. There are similar strategies using the other Bakken stocks mentioned. I am also using a sell-puts/buy-calls strategy across two stocks. I have sold some puts on Northern Oil and Gas and used the premium to buy calls on Oasis. I make a few dimes on the deal and get the short-term upside of Oasis which might be developing momentum, in addition to its fundamental positives. If there is a setback in these stocks, I might end up having to buy Northern Oil and Gas for a little cheaper net cost than today's price, which is fine since I like it in for the long run. In using the sell puts and buy calls strategy, there is also the possibility that all of the options expire unexcercised, in which case the gain is small. While not sexy, it is better than a sharp stick in the eye. If the options all expire, rinse and repeat is what I generally do. I know this seems fairly complex to non-option traders, but learning basic option strategies can be a great way to get more upside with the same downside as buying stocks outright. With the companies discussed, getting that extra short run upside could result in big gains for any number of reasons, such as war in Iran, an oil disruption somewhere else in the world, stronger than expected economic growth numbers, acquisition or revenue and/or earnings beats by the companies which get ahead on their drilling due to good weather.

OAS,"As discussed last week, improvements in hydraulic fracturing has led to vast opportunities for oil and gas service companies that can stay on the right side of the EPA. As most readers know, fracking is also providing significant growth for many oil and gas exploration and production companies in America. This rapid growth is now also creating the circumstances for increased mergers and acquisition activity. Among the fastest growing oil and gas companies and those with the biggest potential are those involved with the Bakken and Three Forks formations in the Williston Basin of North Dakota and to a lesser extent Montana. North Dakota's rich reserves and friendly attitude towards drillers makes it a prime place for oil and gas production. As of last month North Dakota drillers reached 500,000 barrels of oil (and equivalents) per day of production. That curve, presuming no outright shut down of fracking by the Federal Government, appears likely to hit 1,000,000 barrels per day within a few years. Given the intermediate and longer term supply and demand picture for oil and gas, there is a clear desire for companies to control as much strategic reserves as possible. North Dakota has somewhere between 11 billion barrels of oil, according to the North Dakota Geological Survey, and 24 billion barrels of oil, according to Harold Hamm founder of the largest Bakken acreage holder, Continental Resources CLR, -3.43% that is recoverable. This is reserves for several decades even at double today's production and could provide as much as 20% of America's oil needs. Already, acquisitions are beginning to occur. In October of 2011, Statoil purchased Brigham Exploration with its Bakken assets for $4.4 Billion. This purchase by the Norwegian major translated into about $12,000 per acre for access to the high growth area. Further deals seem only a matter of time and will likely be at higher prices per acre. Acreage control in North Dakota is highly fragmented due to the recent and nearly simultaneous realization of the potential of the Williston Basin. Several smaller companies however are highly leveraged to the area and control acreage that is likely highly attractive to the oil and gas majors. I have four companies I am seeking entry prices for which are growing, control attractive land and are potentially likely to seek being acquired at some point soon. The smallest North Dakota acreage holder in the group is Triangle Petroleum TPLM, -11.43% Triangle has a duel strategy of developing about 81,000 acres in the Bakken region, as well as, an 87% ownership in about 474,000 acres in Nova Scotia. The company is looking at strategic opportunities with its Nova Scotia property. It would not be a big surprise to see Triangle seek a buyer for its Bakken acreage if it believed it could use the proceeds to exploit its Canadian opportunities which are relatively low-cost. Triangle's Bakken acreage, using a small premium to the Statoil-Brigham deal could fetch the company over $1 billion. The company's market cap now is only $300 million and it carries little to no debt. Next on the acreage list is Kodiak KOG, -2.43% itself an acquirer including some already producing tracts. Kodiak is holding about 155,000 acres in the Bakken. Much of its land is adjacent to majors which might wish to acquire it. Kodiak also has a secondary play in the Green River Basin in southern Wyoming and northern Colorado. The company appears to have overcome some perceived financing risks and is ramping up production. Given the good weather so far this winter, if it is not acquired soon, it could see further share price appreciation as it increases production. Its acreage is valued at roughly $2 billion. The company has a market cap of about $2 billion and debt of under $100 million. Similar to Kodiak in acreage is Northern Oil and Gas NOG, +2.02% with about 160,000 net acres in the Bakken and Three Forks. Northern is focused on a low expense strategy as a non-operator by having partners handle the drilling of its property. Its return on assets is ahead of many other small cap companies nearing 10%. It anticipates adding 44 wells in 2012 to the 40 it added in 2011. Northern's acreage is also valued about $2 billion. With a market cap of only $1.5 billion and little debt the company could be a compelling value to an acquirer. Northern already has relationships with several larger companies. If Northern is not acquired, I can see them beginning to pay a dividend in the near future. Rounding out the four potential targets is the largest acreage holder, Oasis Petroleum OAS, -3.33% with 303 acres. Oasis is a pure play on the Williston Basin. Its property is essentially right next door to the Brigham property that Statoil bought just a few months ago. Oasis has sold off some of its more difficult to develop land, leaving it about 250,000 acres that are likely to be developed over time. Oasis is returning over 10% on assets and has no immediate liquidity issues owing to its low cost of original land acquisition at around $450 per acre. The company can choose to grow over time or be selective if suitors turn up. Due to the large acreage it controls, the 10th largest in the region according to industry statistics, it could command a larger premium than some of the smaller plays mentioned in this article, possibly fetching as much as $5 billion. The company has a market cap of a mere $3 billion. This is another company that could begin paying a dividend soon.

OAS,"--Fund focuses on small-cap companies --Fund has tried to limit its exposure to European debt crisis --Manager says he prefers lesser-known industries and equities NEW YORK (MarketWatch) -- For T. Rowe Price small-capitalization fund manager Preston G. Athey, companies with flash and familiarity aren't necessarily selling points. ""When they are household names and they have sexy stories, they tend not to be values,"" said Athey, who manages the $6.9 billion T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Value fund PRSVX, +0.98% ""I am trolling around in the backwaters, looking for industries and companies that the world doesn't know about."" The fund--with more than 300 equities in industries that range from oil and natural gas to logistics to appliance rentals--targets companies with a market capitalization of between $100 million and about $3 billion, promising investors a slow and steady return. Athey said he has worked to protect his fund from exposure to the debt crisis in Europe by selecting stocks that are focused primarily on North America. ""If you own some American companies that have very little in the way of exports, this is at least one way you can invest,"" said Athey. ""I've got dozens of these things."" The fund's focus on lesser-known companies has helped it return more than 17% over the past three years on an annualized basis, though the fund declined less than 1% in 2011, according to Morningstar Inc. That compares with a return of 12% over the past three years and 0.9% in 2011 at Morningstar's U.S. Value index. Morningstar rates the fund four stars out of five and said its overall return is ""above average."" Athey said he likes Signature Bank SBNY, -2.06% and SVB Financial Group SIVB, -2.57% which runs Silicon Valley Bank, because they are sheltered from loans to Greece and other embattled European countries. Signature returned 20% last year through Dec. 30, while SVB dropped 10%. SVB makes loans to venture capitalists, who Athey said generally invest in U.S. companies. ""This is the bank that almost every venture-capital firm banks with, so I am not particularly worried about their prospects if something bad happens in Europe."" Barge operator Kirby Corp. KEX, -0.06% comprising less than 1% of the fund's holdings, was one of its top performers in 2011, gaining 49% through Dec. 30. Athey said that due to cheaper gasoline prices Dow Chemical Co. DOW, -0.77% and E.I. DuPont de Nemours & Co. DD, +0.94% among others, are exporting more petrochemicals, benefitting Kirby, which moves chemicals within the U.S. ""The longer that gas prices stay low, the more our exports will be advantaged,"" said Athey. ""Kirby is in a great position to take advantage of that."" Small oil and gas companies will also play an important role in the fund's future, said Athey. He recommends Oasis Petroleum Inc. OAS, -3.58% and Northern Oil & Gas Inc. NOG, +2.02% for growth in the coming year. The fund is also poised to grow from investments in health-care companies that aren't exposed to Europe. ""You can't get away from nursing homes, we continue to have an aging population,"" said Athey. That's why he will continue investing in National HealthCare Corp. NHC, +0.49% which provides long-term health care services, he said. National HealthCare was down 9.4% last year through Dec. 30. ""All these companies are oblivious to what's happening in Europe,"" said Athey. ""They're doing their thing here in the U.S."" Athey said he likes to invest in companies and hold onto them for years. In the past 10 years, the fund has averaged about 10% turnover among its holdings, compared with as much as 50% for other small-cap funds, said Athey. ""If it's a sexy, high-growth company, it'll probably be way too expensive,"" he said.

OAS,"Standard & Poor's Ratings Services raised its outlook on Oasis Petroleum Inc. OAS, -3.64% citing the exploration and production company's speedy progress growing its asset base. Oasis was formed in 2007 to acquire and develop oil and gas fields in a portion of the largely undeveloped Williston Basin in Montana and North Dakota. The company has reported higher production and strong top line growth since it went public last year. The ratings firm pointed specifically to the company's growing asset base, which helped boost production volumes 110% over the prior-year quarter. S&P now rates Oasis at B, five steps below investment grade. The current status reflects the company's small asset base and low production levels relative to its peers, along with its heavy geographic concentration, an aggressive growth strategy, a limited operating track record, previously weak accounting control processes and negative cash flow generation. At the same time, Oasis benefits from high crude oil prices, a favorable cost structure, high growth potential and sizeable acreage position. The positive outlook could translate to a ratings upgrade if the company meets its production and reserve growth goals over the next several quarters, S&P said. Moody's Investor's Service rates the company at B3, a notch below S&P's rating, based on the company's small scale and limited operating history. Shares were recently off 15 cents at $32.23 Thursday. The stock has climbed by about a third over the past month.

OAS,"HOUSTON, Dec. 11, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Oasis Petroleum Inc. OAS, -4.69% (""Oasis"" or the ""Company"") today announced it has entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement with Forge Energy, LLC (the ""Seller"") to acquire 20,300 net acres in the Delaware Basin (the ""Permian Assets"") for approximately $946 million, consisting of approximately $483 million in cash and 46 million shares of the Company's common stock (the ""OAS Shares"") valued at approximately $463 million as of the close of trading on December 8, 2017 (the ""Acquisition"").  The Acquisition will be funded through a combination of the OAS Shares issued to the Seller, a draw on the Company's revolving credit facility, and/or capital markets transactions, depending on market conditions. Additionally, Oasis expects to divest non-core Williston Basin acreage up to $500 million in 2018. The Acquisition has an effective date of December 1, 2017 and is expected to close in February 2018, at which time the owners of the Seller will receive full consideration less a deposit paid. The transaction is subject to customary closing adjustments and conditions. Tommy Nusz, Oasis's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented ""This accretive transaction more than doubles Oasis's core net inventory and represents a unique opportunity to acquire a highly complementary asset to Oasis's premier Williston Basin acreage that positions the Company to further capitalize on its operational strengths. Our leading track record of efficient full field development in the Williston Basin positions Oasis to succeed as we expand operations into the Delaware Basin. Our new Permian Assets deliver a consolidated position in the deepest and highest pressured part of the Delaware in the heart of the oil window. The Seller and offset operators have materially de-risked this position with recent well performance across the Wolfcamp and Bone Spring formations, giving us additional confidence in asset quality and well performance. This transaction further improves the capital efficiency of our development program, while providing an opportunity to divest and realize value for quality assets that fall deeper in our development program. We are excited for this new chapter, and also remain committed to our current capital-disciplined and returns-focused execution plan in the Williston Basin.  As we execute our combined program in 2018, we expect to be free cash flow positive on our E&P business running a $55 WTI oil price.""  Acquisition Highlights Approximately 20,300 net acres acquired in the Delaware Basin across Loving, Ward, Winkler and Reeves Counties, Texas; Approximately 3,500 barrels of oil equivalent (""Boe"") per day produced in November 2017 ($170 million PDP value at November 30, 2017 strip pricing); 601 gross operated locations (76% working interest) and 507 net core locations targeting the Wolfcamp A, B, and C and the Bone Spring formations, with extensive additional upside from other intervals in the column; Largely contiguous acreage blocks that allow for longer lateral development (expected median lateral length of approximately 8,000 feet); Ability to transfer technical, operational and managerial knowledge from full-field development of the Williston Basin to the Delaware Basin, in addition to future efficiencies from the vertical integration of Oasis Midstream Services LLC and Oasis Well Services LLC; Accretive to per-share NAV, long term cash flow, balance sheet, core inventory and overall inventory; Trading attractive non-core acreage in the Williston Basin for core Delaware Basin acreage; Expect to drill 16 to 20 gross wells and complete 6 to 8 gross wells with a capital program of approximately $100 million in 2018; and Initially running one rig with the potential to add a second rig in the second half of 2018 Recent Results and Updated Guidance Oasis production for October was approximately 70,000 Boe per day, and November operational production exceeded 72,000 Boe per day, already surpassing the planned 2017 exit rate. In light of the increased production, guidance for the fourth quarter of 2017 is increased from 69,000 – 72,000 Boe per day, to 71,000 – 73,000 Boe per dayOasis expects to continue to run five rigs in the Williston Basin, and will assume one rig currently run by the Seller in the Delaware Basin.  Additionally, Oasis expects lease operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2017 to range between $7.00 and $7.50 per Boe and differentials to range between $0.50 and $1.00 per Boe. Oasis continues to expect production in the Williston Basin to exceed 83,000 Boe per day exiting 2018, not accounting for volumes to be divested through planned asset sales, and expects production to grow to over 5,000 Boe per day in the Delaware Basin exiting 2018. As of November 30, 2017, Oasis had $333.0 million drawn and $10.5 million in letters of credit outstanding under its $1.6 billion borrowing base and $2.1 million in cash.

OAS,"HOUSTON, Nov. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Oasis Petroleum Inc. OAS, -4.63% (""Oasis"" or the ""Company"") today announced financial results for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and provided an operational update. Recent Highlights: Completed and placed on production 24 gross (15.1 net) operated wells in the Williston Basin in the third quarter of 2017. Produced 66.1 thousand barrels of oil equivalent per day (""MBoepd"") in the third quarter of 2017, representing an increase of 7% over the second quarter of 2017, primarily driven by completion activity. Production during the third quarter of 2017 increased 36% over the third quarter of 2016. Produced over 69 MBoepd in October 2017 and expect to produce between 69 MBoepd and 72 MBoepd in the fourth quarter of 2017. Oasis continues to expect to hit an exit rate of 72 MBoepd, delivering 16% growth above the 2016 exit rate. Oil differentials have improved to $1.82 off of NYMEX West Texas Intermediate crude oil index price (""WTI"") in the third quarter of 2017, and Oasis expects differentials in the fourth quarter to range from $1.25 to $2.00 off of WTI. Delivered Adjusted EBITDA of $179.6 million for the third quarter of 2017. For definitions of Adjusted EBITDA and reconciliations of Adjusted EBITDA to net income and net cash provided by operating activities, see ""Non-GAAP Financial Measures"" below. Commenced operations of its second Oasis Well Services (""OWS"") frac crew during the third quarter of 2017. Oasis Midstream Partners LP (""OMP"") sold 8,625,000 common units, representing limited partner interests in an initial public offering (""IPO"" or the ""Offering"") for net proceeds of $137.2 million, of which $131.6 million was distributed to Oasis. Announced investment in and assignment of second Wild Basin Gas Plant (""Gas Plant II"") with a total capacity of 200 million standard cubic feet per day (""MMscfpd"") to service gas production from its highly economic inventory. Expects full year 2017 adjusted CapEx to total $620.0 million, in line with prior guidance. See ""Capital Expenditures"" below for adjustments. Including net proceeds distributed to Oasis from the OMP IPO and adjustments for the Gas Plant II assignment, Oasis generated positive free cash flow of $39.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. ""Oasis successfully delivered on production growth during the quarter in line with guidance, completed its IPO of OMP, and launched its second frac crew,"" said Thomas B. Nusz, Oasis' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. ""The team delivered another great quarter and has positioned Oasis to exit the year with 72 MBoepd of production. Well performance across our core acreage position, including Wild Basin, Indian Hills, and Alger, continues to deliver impressive results, and our wells remain highly economic in the current commodity price environment. The team has also further reduced operating costs while driving improved differentials benefiting from our integrated midstream infrastructure."" Gas Plant II Update Oil and gas production from Oasis' Wild Basin wells continues to exceed expectations, primarily due to higher frac intensity in the core areas of the Williston Basin.  The initial gas to oil ratio (""GOR"") is generally higher in the core of the Williston Basin, including parts of McKenzie County, compared to the entire basin.  The combined effect of these factors has resulted in record gas production levels in the Williston Basin and particularly in McKenzie County where much of the drilling since 2015 has occurred, which now produces approximately half of the gas production in North Dakota. Due to the increased production of gas in the Williston Basin, there is a need for incremental processing capacity in the basin.   Gas production in Wild Basin has already surpassed original design expectations for OMP's 80 MMscfpd gas plant, which is held by OMP's wholly-owned development company (""DevCo""), Bighorn DevCo LLC (""Bighorn DevCo""), and recently has averaged gross gas production in Wild Basin of approximately 100 MMscfpd. Oasis initially evaluated options to process the incremental gas that is being produced in and around Wild Basin and subsequently began the front end engineering and design process for a second gas plant and began ordering long lead time items. Oasis recently made the decision to proceed with the construction of Gas Plant II, and on November 6, 2017, Oasis agreed to assign the project to OMP. In exchange for the assignment of Gas Plant II into Bighorn DevCo, OMP agreed to reimburse Oasis for 100% of the capital spent-to-date and will fund 100% of the remaining project capital. OMP funded the reimbursement under its revolving credit facility and will have full rights to all cash flows generated from both gas plants held by Bighorn DevCo. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, Oasis invested $57.0 million in Gas Plant II, and on November 6,2017, assigned $66.7 million of asset value to OMP, which included capital spent in October 2017. OMP expects to invest approximately $140.0 million for the entire Gas Plant II project and anticipates operations will begin in late 2018.

Capital Expenditures The following table depicts the Company's total CapEx by category:  1Q 2017  2Q 2017  3Q 2017  YTD 2017 CapEx ($ in millions):        E&P $ 90.8   $ 100.8   $ 149.9   $ 341.5  Midstream 13.1   66.1   79.6   158.9  Well services —   0.3   5.1   5.4  Other(1) 5.9   5.8   5.7   17.3  Total CapEx(2) $ 109.8   $ 173.0   $ 240.3   $ 523.1  ___________________ (1) Other CapEx includes such items as administrative capital and capitalized interest. (2) CapEx reflected in the table above differs from the amounts shown in the statement of cash flows in the Company's condensed consolidated financial statements because amounts reflected in the table above include changes in accrued liabilities from the previous reporting period for capital expenditures, while the amounts presented in the statement of cash flows are presented on a cash basis. The Company's CapEx totaled $523.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, of which $57.0 million was reimbursed by OMP with the assignment of Gas Plant II. Additionally, the Company acquired a freshwater intake facility from the Missouri River and a freshwater distribution system that it is expanding to service a portion of the Company's completion activity in Wild Basin (the ""Freshwater Project""). The Freshwater Project costs for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, including the acquisition, have totaled approximately $23.0 million. At the time of the OMP IPO, the Freshwater Project was included in Beartooth DevCo LLC, which is 60% owned by Oasis. Excluding the Gas Plant II and the Freshwater Project, CapEx would have totaled $443.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, which is in line with the Company's CapEx plan for the nine months ended September 30, 2017. Excluding the Gas Plant II and the Freshwater Project for the full year 2017 CapEx, Oasis continues to expect adjusted CapEx to be approximately $620.0 million, which includes $15.0 million for activating the second frac spread for OWS.
