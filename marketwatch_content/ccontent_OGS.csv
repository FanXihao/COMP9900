OGS,"Investors may consider natural gas distributors, through pipeline operators or utilities, to be suitable mainly for dividend income but not necessarily for growth, as falling energy prices are a big risk. But you can see in the following charts that there’s quite a bit of growth among natural gas utilities, even with low energy commodity prices. The $1.4 billion Hennessy Gas Utility Fund GASFX, -1.06%  has exclusive license to track the American Gas Association (AGA) Stock Index. The index is made up of companies that are members of the AGA, weighted by market capitalization and the share of assets related to natural gas distribution. According to the Ryan Kelley and Skip Aylesworth, two of the fund’s portfolio mangers (the third is Brian Peery), about 25% of the fund’s holdings are stocks of local natural gas distributors, 25% general partners that manage pipeline limited partnerships and the remaining 50% multi-utilities that distribute electricity and natural gas. Hennessy Funds is headquartered in Novato, Calif., and has about $6.5 billion in assets under management, in 14 mutual funds. You might be familiar with the gas pipeline partnership space, which is known for its attractive dividend yields, and most easily tracked with the Alerian MLP Index AMZ, -0.81% But the  AGA Stock Index, and, in turn, the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund, steers clear of the limited partnerships. “We prefer to own the general partner as opposed to the MLP,” Aylesworth said when he and Kelley were interviewed by MarketWatch on Sept. 22. “The general partner is, in essence, who manages and controls the limited partner, and controls the timing [corporate structure] conversions that trigger tax issues.” The Alerian MLP ETF AMLP, -0.75%  has a dividend yield of 8.05%, while the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund’s investor shares have a much lower yield of 2.33%. But check out the difference in the funds’ performance over the past five years: FactSet You can see that the oil price decline from July 2014 to February 2016 had a much smaller effect on the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund. Here’s a 10-year comparison of the funds’ total returns: FactSet Here’s an example of how the AGA stocks index modifies the market-capitalization weighting of companies. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. BRK.B, -2.25%  is a tremendous company, but with only about 0.2% of its assets related to natural gas distribution, it makes up only 0.5% of the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund’s portfolio. Growth factors Kelley said mergers among natural gas companies have helped to prop up stock prices, as large companies, including many Canadian energy companies, seek to enter the growing market. He pointed to statistics from the Energy Information Administration showing that while total energy consumption in the U.S. declined by 2% from 2006 through 2016, the use of natural gas increased by 27%, “essentially taking market share from coal, which was down 37%.” Hennessy Funds Ryan Kelley, manager of the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund. Aylesworth said companies buying into the natural gas space have typically been “large and well-established companies eating the small.” When asked how the action was affecting the fund’s performance, he said: “The M&A price premium has generally been 20% to 30%, so we’re picking up that pop in the price. And buyers have not had significant declines from these purchases.” Hennessy Funds Skip Aylesworth, portfolio manager of the Hennessy Gas Utility Fund. With the tremendous increase in domestic gas production, the U.S. has become an exporter of liquid natural gas, and the fund’s largest holding, Cheniere Energy Inc. LNG, -0.86% is the only company currently operating liquid natural gas tankers, although “others are planned,” according to Aylesworth. He cited the company as an example of one that is lumped in with pipelines and sensitive to commodity price changes. But overall, low natural gas prices — and the commodity’s less harmful effects than coal — have helped the industry grow. What’s important for the fund’s importance is the increase in the flow of natural gas. “We are investing in the toll takers. Low commodity prices are a good thing,” Aylesworth said.

OGS,"Not everybody’s a day trader. But most financial news outlets keep covering the same companies over and over, prompting investors to focus on the short term. However, it pays, literally, to stray from the beaten path. And, from what we’ve just learned, old companies — really old companies — can beat the darlings of today. So we’re going in the opposite direction of investing-news agendas and looking at companies that have been around for at least 100 years. Some readers who provided feedback on our list of 5 dividend stocks with 10-year returns of up to 569% pointed out, tongue in cheek, that it would have been more useful if we had published the story 10 years ago. But the important part was making a link between consistent dividend increases and strong long-term performance. Plus, we highlighted companies that many investors may not have heard about. For today’s deep dive, we identified 448 U.S. companies founded at least a century ago that are publicly traded today, using information provided by FactSet. Among the group, 294 have been publicly traded for at least 20 years. The list excludes some old companies, including Bank of New York Mellon Corp. BK, -2.68% Bank of New York itself was founded in 1784; however, the current company was formed through a merger in 2007, and therefore is quite different than it has been in the past. Among the 294 “old-timers,” 133, or 45%, have achieved total returns, with reinvested dividends, exceeding the 505% total return of the S&P 500 Index SPX, -2.23% through Friday’s market close. We looked at 20-year total returns because that takes us back before the Internet bubble of the late 1990s that burst in 2000 and 2001, as well as the real estate bubble that was popped in 2008. So here are the five stocks of U.S. companies that are more than 100 years old, with average daily trading volume of at least 45,000 shares, with the best total returns over two decades: This approach excludes familiar high-flyers saturated in the media, of course. Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.66% for example, has achieved a 20-year total return of 8,254%, but it was founded only in 1976. Four of the five names on the list have even beaten the S&P 500’s 10- and five-year total returns. Here’s a look at a diverse group of old-timers that have served their loyal long-term shareholders so well: Middleby Corp. Middleby EPS comparison chart at FindTheBest Middleby Corp. MIDD, -0.15%  of Elgin, Ill., manufactures equipment used in commercial and institutional kitchens, and also sells residential kitchen equipment, distributed through dozens of brands, including Pitco Frialator. The company was founded in 1888. Middleby’s stock has returned an astounding 14,784% over the past 20 years. Even over five years, a time period that isn’t listed as an item in the accompanying chart, Middleby has surged 472%, soundly beating the S&P 500’s 139% return. Following an 87% gain during 2013, Middleby’s stock is up 5% this year through Friday’s close at $252.61. The shares trade for 22 times the consensus 2015 earnings estimate of $11.59, among analysts polled by FactSet. That may seem like a high valuation, but it’s a growth company, after all. Middleby reported fourth-quarter earnings of $49.9 million, or $2.62 a share, increasing from $37.8 million, or $2.03, a year earlier. Sales rose 29% to $377.4 million. Even if three major acquisitions are excluded, the company’s sales grew 13% last year. Kansas City Southern Kansas City Southern EPS comparison chart at FindTheBest Kansas City Southern KSU, -1.47%  operates three railroads, including Kansas City Southern Railway, Kansas City Southern de Mexico and the Panama Canal Railway Co. The company was founded in 1887, making it the oldest on our list. The stock has returned 11,662% over 20 years. Kansas City Southern’s stock closed at 99.27 Friday, down 20% this year, following a 50% return in 2013. The stock was hammered in February when the lower house of Mexico’s congress approved a bill that would open up competition by giving other companies access to exclusively controlled railroads. This issue is still in play, as company officials earlier this month said they expected Mexico’s Senate to modify the new law, but it is clearly a major risk for the company, which draws roughly half its revenue from Mexico. The company reported a 10% increase in first-quarter revenue to $607.4 million, but lease termination costs of $19.9 led to a 10% a decline in net income available to common shareholders to $93.6 million. EPS came in at 85 cents, down from 94 cents a year earlier. The stock closed Friday at $99.27 and traded for 18 times the consensus 2015 EPS estimate of $5.42. The consensus 2014 EPS estimate is $4.67. Please see the next page for three more companies.

OGS,"Oneok Inc.'s OKE, -1.37% said its fourth-quarter earnings fell 19% on expenses related to the wind down of its energy business and the recent spinoff of its natural-gas distribution business. Pipeline and natural-gas gathering business Oneok Partners LP OKS reported fourth-quarter profit rose 8.5% on higher natural-gas and natural-gas liquids volumes thanks to the company's completed growth projects. Oneok, which distributes natural gas through utilities in Oklahoma, Kansas and Texas, has faced challenges resulting from low natural-gas prices caused by an overabundance of supply. Oneok Partners, its gas-gathering and transportation affiliate also has been hurt by lower commodities prices. Oneok completed the separation of its natural-gas distribution business in January into a publicly traded company called One Gas Inc. OGS, -0.71% creating one of the largest natural-gas utilities in the U.S. One Gas consists of Oklahoma Natural Gas Co., Kansas Gas Service and Texas Gas Service. The move followed Oneok's plan to exit its energy-services business, which remains on track to wind down completely by April 1. Oneok Inc. reported a profit of $90.7 million, or 43 cents a share, down from $111.5 million, or 53 cents a share, a year earlier. The latest period included 11 cents a share in charges and costs related to the wind down of its energy business and the separation of One Gas. Revenue increased 13% to $4.14 billion. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters recently expected per-share earnings of 58 cents and revenue of $4.01 billion. Oneok Partners reported a profit of $228.4 million, up from $210.4 million a year earlier. On a per-unit basis, which reflects limited partner interests, earnings increased to 67 cents from 66 cents.

OGS,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY We are a 100-percent regulated natural gas distribution company. As such, our regulators determine the rates we are allowed to charge for our service based on our revenue requirements needed to achieve our authorized rates of return. We earn revenues from the delivery of natural gas, but do not earn a profit on the natural gas that we deliver, as those costs are passed through to our customers at cost. The primary components of our revenue requirements are the amount of capital invested in our business, which is also known as rate base, our allowed rate of return on our capital investments and our recoverable operating expenses, including depreciation and income taxes. Our rates have both a fixed and a variable component, with approximately 71 percent of our natural gas sales net margin in 2017 derived from fixed monthly charges to our customers. The variable component of our rates is dependent on the consumption of natural gas, which is impacted primarily by the weather and, to a lesser extent, economic activity. While we have weather normalization mechanisms in most jurisdictions that adjust customers' bills when the actual HDDs differ from normalized HDDs, these mechanisms are in place for only a portion of the year and do not offset all fluctuations in usage resulting from weather variability. Accordingly, the weather can have either a positive or negative impact on our financial performance. Our financial performance, therefore, is contingent on a number of factors, including: (1) regulatory outcomes, which determine the returns we are authorized to earn and the rates we are allowed to charge for our service; (2) the consumption of natural gas, which impacts the amount of our net margin derived from the variable component of our rates; (3) our operating performance, which impacts our operating expenses; and (4) the perceived value of natural gas relative to other energy sources, particularly electricity, which influences our customers' choice of natural gas to provide a portion of their energy needs. We are subject to regulatory requirements for pipeline integrity and environmental compliance. These requirements impact our operating expenses and the level of capital expenditures required for compliance. Historically, our regulators have allowed recovery of these expenditures. However, because integrity and environmental regulation is changing constantly, our capital and operating expenditures to comply will change, as well. Although we believe our regulators will continue to allow recovery of such expenditures in the future, we will continue to make these expenditures with no assurance about if, or over what period, we will be permitted to recover them. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS Tax Reform - In December 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 was signed into law. Substantially all of the provisions of the new law are effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. The new law includes significant changes to the Code, including amendments which significantly change the taxation of business entities and includes specific provisions related to regulated public utilities. The more significant changes that impact us include reductions in the corporate federal statutory income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, and several technical provisions including, among others, the elimination of full expensing for tax purposes of certain property acquired after September 27, 2017, the continuation of certain rate normalization requirements for accelerated depreciation benefits and the general allowance for the continued deductibility of interest expense. Additionally, the new law limits the utilization of NOLs arising after December 31, 2017, to 80 percent of taxable income with an indefinite carryforward. As a result of the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we remeasured our deferred income taxes based upon the new tax rate enacted in 2017. As a regulated entity, the change in deferred income taxes is recorded as an offset to a regulatory liability and may be subject to refund to customers. The effect on the net deferred income tax liability for the enacted decrease in the federal tax rate was $517.2 million, of which $519.4 million was recorded as a reduction to the deferred income tax liabilities and deferred as a regulatory liability for ratemaking purposes and offset by $2.2 million recorded as an increase in deferred income tax expense attributable to the remeasured deferred income taxes associated with certain expenses not currently recovered in our rates. These adjustments had no impact on our 2017 cash flows. See Regulatory Activities below for a discussion of the impact of tax reform on our rates in each state. Dividend - In January 2018, we declared a dividend of $0.46 per share ($1.84 per share on an annualized basis) for shareholders of record as of February 23, 2018, payable on March 9, 2018. REGULATORY ACTIVITIES Oklahoma - In March 2017, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its first annual PBRC following the general rate case that was approved in January 2016. This filing was based on a calendar test year of 2016. The PBRC filing demonstrated that Oklahoma Natural Gas was earning within the allowed return on equity range of 9.0 to 10.0 percent. Therefore, Oklahoma Natural Gas did not seek a modification to base rates. The filing also requested an energy efficiency program true-up and utility incentive adjustment of approximately $1.9 million. A joint stipulation and settlement agreement was approved by the OCC in August 2017. As required, PBRC filings are made annually on March 15, until the next general rate case, which is currently required to be filed on or before June 30, 2021, based on a calendar test year of 2020. In March 2016, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its energy efficiency program true-up application for its 2015 program year, requesting a utility incentive of $1.9 million and a program true-up adjustment of $3.1 million. This filing also sought approval for the demand portfolio of conservation and energy efficiency programs for calendar years 2017 through 2019. In October 2016, the OCC approved the joint stipulation and settlement agreement. In July 2015, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed a request with the OCC for an increase in base rates, reflecting system investments and operating costs necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of its natural gas distribution system. In January 2016, the OCC approved a joint stipulation and settlement agreement to allow an increase in revenue of $29,995,000. We also recorded a regulatory asset of $2.4 million to recover certain information technology costs incurred as a result of our separation from ONEOK in 2014, which will be recovered over four years. The agreement set Oklahoma Natural Gas' authorized return on equity at 9.5 percent, which represents the midpoint of the allowed range of 9.0 to 10.0 percent, and approved a rate base of approximately $1.2 billion. The agreement includes the continuation, with certain modifications, of the PBRC tariff that was established in 2009. In March 2015, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its energy efficiency program true-up application for its 2014 program year, requesting a utility incentive of $1.2 million. In December 2015, the OCC approved the joint stipulation and settlement agreement which was filed in July 2015. Kansas - In August 2017, Kansas Gas Service submitted an application to the KCC requesting an increase of approximately $2.9 million related to its GSRS. In November 2017, the KCC approved the $2.9 million increase effective December 2017. In April 2017, Kansas Gas Service filed an application with the KCC seeking approval of an AAO associated with the costs incurred at, and nearby, the 12 former MGP sites which we own or retain responsibility for certain environmental conditions. In October 2017, Kansas Gas Service, the KCC staff and the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board filed a unanimous settlement agreement with the KCC. The agreement allows Kansas Gas Service to defer and seek recovery of costs that are necessary for investigation and remediation at the 12 former MGP sites incurred after January 1, 2017, up to a cap of $15.0 million, net of any related insurance recoveries. Costs approved in a future rate proceeding would then be amortized over a 15-year period. The unamortized amounts will not be included in rate base or accumulate carrying charges. At the time future investigation and remediation work, net of any related insurance recoveries, is expected to exceed $15.0 million, Kansas Gas Service will be required to file an application with the KCC for approval to increase the $15.0 million cap. The KCC issued an order approving the settlement agreement in November 2017. A regulatory asset of approximately $5.9 million was recorded for estimated costs that have been accrued at January 1, 2017. See discussion below in Environmental, Safety and Regulatory Matters for additional information concerning the 12 former MGP sites. In May 2016, Kansas Gas Service filed a request with the KCC for an increase in base rates, reflecting system investments and operating costs necessary to maintain the safety and reliability of its natural gas distribution system. In October 2016, Kansas Gas Service reached a unanimous settlement agreement with all parties for a net increase in base rates of approximately $8.1 million. Including the GSRS of approximately $7.4 million, the total base rate increase was $15.5 million. The agreement was a ""black-box settlement,"" meaning the parties agreed to a specific revenue number but no specific return on equity or determination with respect to other contested issues. Additionally, the agreement modified the weather normalization clause to accrue the variation in net margin resulting from the difference in actual weather relative to normal weather over 12 months, rather than five months. The KCC approved the new rates effective January 1, 2017. In August 2015, Kansas Gas Service submitted an application to the KCC requesting an increase of approximately $2.4 million related to its GSRS. In November 2015, the KCC approved the $2.4 million increase effective December 2015. Texas - West Texas Service Area - In March 2017, Texas Gas Service made GRIP filings for all customers in the West Texas service area. The RRC and the cities approved an increase of $4.3 million and new rates became effective in July 2017. In November 2015, Texas Gas Service notified the EPSA that it would be filing a full rate case in 2016 in lieu of the previously agreed to annual rate review mechanism called EPARR. In March 2016, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case for its El Paso, Dell City and Permian service areas, as well as consolidation of these three areas. In September 2016, the RRC approved the consolidation and a base rate increase of $8.8 million, which was based on a 9.5 percent return on equity and a 60.1 percent common equity ratio. In October 2016, new rates went into effect for all customers, except for those in the cities of the former Permian service area. Texas Gas Service filed for these new rates for customers in the cities of the former Permian service area in October 2016, and the rates became effective in December 2016. Rio Grande Valley Service Area - In January 2018, Texas Gas Service reached a settlement with the RRC Staff in the unincorporated areas of the Rio Grande Valley service area. This settlement, if approved by the RRC, will result in an increase in revenues of $0.5 million with new rates expected to be effective by April 2018. This settlement reflects a corporate income tax rate of 21 percent associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and requires Texas Gas Service to calculate, defer and begin refunding to customers the rate reductions resulting from changes to the corporate tax rate made in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 that would have occurred between January 1, 2018 and the effective date of the new rates. In June 2017, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case for customers in its Rio Grande Valley service area. In October 2017, Texas Gas Service and the cities in the Rio Grande Valley service area agreed to an increase of $3.6 million, and new rates became effective in October 2017. Central Texas Service Area - In March 2017, Texas Gas Service made GRIP filings for customers of the consolidated Central Texas service area. The cities and the RRC approved an increase of $4.9 million, and new rates became effective in June 2017. In June 2016, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case for its Central Texas and South Texas service areas. The filing included a request to consolidate the South Texas service area with the Central Texas service area. Texas Gas Service filed this rate case directly with the cities of the Central Texas service area, which includes the city of Austin, and the RRC for the unincorporated areas. In October 2016, all parties to the filing reached a unanimous settlement agreement for an increase in revenues of $6.8 million for the new consolidated service area. New rates were effective in November 2016, for customers in the cities of the former Central Texas service area. RRC approval was received in November 2016 and new rates became effective for customers in the unincorporated areas of the new consolidated Central Texas service area the same month. Texas Gas Service received approval for the same rates in the incorporated areas of the former South Texas service area, with new rates effective in January 2017. Texas Gas Service received approval under the GRIP statute with the city of Austin, Texas, and surrounding communities in May 2015, for an increase in revenues of approximately $3.7 million. The new rates were effective in June 2015. Gulf Coast Service Area - In December 2015, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case for its Galveston and South Jefferson County service areas, which included a request to consolidate these two service areas into a new Gulf Coast service area. Texas Gas Service filed this rate case directly with the incorporated cities and the RRC for the unincorporated areas. Texas Gas Service reached a unanimous settlement agreement with representatives of the cities and the staff of the RRC, on behalf of the unincorporated areas for an increase in revenues of $2.3 million. Following RRC approval, new rates became effective in May 2016. El Paso Service Area - In March 2015, Texas Gas Service filed under the EPARR, requesting an increase in revenues totaling $11.2 million in the city of El Paso and surrounding incorporated cities in the EPSA. In August 2015, Texas Gas Service and the incorporated cities in the EPSA reached an agreement on a rate increase of $8.0 million to take effect in August 2015. In April 2015, Texas Gas Service filed with the RRC under the GRIP statute, requesting an increase of $0.4 million in revenues for the unincorporated areas of the EPSA. The RRC approved the filing in July 2015. Other Texas Service Areas - In the normal course of business, Texas Gas Service has filed rate cases and sought GRIP and COSA increases in various other Texas jurisdictions to address investments in rate base and changes in expenses. Annual rate increases associated with these filings that were approved totaled $1.4 million, $2.0 million and $4.8 million in 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Tax Reform - We are working with our regulators in each of the states that we operate to address the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on our rates. In each state, we have received or expect to receive accounting orders requiring us to establish a separate regulatory liability for the difference in taxes included in our rates that have been calculated based on a 35 percent statutory income tax rate and the new 21 percent statutory income tax rate beginning in January 2018. The establishment of this regulatory liability will result in a reduction to our revenues beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2018. The amount, period and timing of the return of these liabilities to our customers will be determined by our regulators in each of our jurisdictions. The following regulatory activities relate to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017: Oklahoma - In December 2017, the Oklahoma Attorney General filed a motion on behalf of customers in Oklahoma requesting that the OCC take action for an immediate reduction in rates and protection of rate payers' interests. On January 9, 2018, the Commissioners approved an order directing Oklahoma Natural Gas to record a deferred liability beginning on the effective date of the order to reflect the reduced federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent and the associated savings in excess ADIT and any other tax implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on an interim basis, subject to refund, until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings and a final order is issued in Oklahoma Natural Gas' next scheduled PBRC proceeding. The order also directs Oklahoma Natural Gas, to the extent not already accounted for in Oklahoma Natural Gas' current PBRC tariff, to accrue interest at a rate equivalent to Oklahoma Natural Gas' cost of capital as recognized in the most recent PBRC filing on the amounts of any refunds determined to be owed to customers until issuance of a final order in the upcoming PBRC proceeding. Kansas - On January 18, 2018, the KCC opened a general investigation for the purposes of examining the financial impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on regulated public utilities operating in Kansas. The KCC also granted a KCC Staff recommendation: (1) to issue an AAO requiring utilities to track and accumulate, in a deferred revenue account, the portion of their revenue that results from the use of a 35 percent federal corporate tax rate for its last KCC-approved revenue determination instead of the new lower federal corporate tax rate; (2) that the deferrals commence on the effective date of the new federal corporate tax rate; (3) that the KCC express its intent to capture excess ADIT in a manner consistent with tax normalization rules; and In December 2017, Kansas Industrial Consumers (""KIC"") filed a complaint against all utilities asking the KCC to act to ensure that KIC members are not charged unreasonable rates because of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In January 2018, the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board filed a complaint stating that the change in tax rates requires the KCC to not only address the reduction in the corporate tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent, but also excess ADIT. As of February 2018, the KCC has not made a final determination on these two complaints. Texas - The RRC is in the process of determining how the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 will be reflected in gas utility rates in Texas. On January 23, 2018, the RRC directed the Commission's gas services division to analyze the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on current gas utility rates and to develop recommendations to ensure that, beginning January 1, 2018, all gas utility customers in Texas receive the full benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. See Liquidity and Capital Resources - Tax Reform and Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional discussion of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. OTHER Certain costs to be recovered through the ratemaking process have been capitalized as regulatory assets. Should recovery cease due to regulatory actions, certain of these assets may no longer meet the criteria for recognition and accordingly, a writeoff of regulatory assets and stranded costs may be required. There were no writeoffs of regulatory assets resulting from the failure to meet the criteria for capitalization during 2017, 2016 and 2015. In 2017, we formed a wholly-owned captive insurance company in the state of Oklahoma to provide insurance to our divisions. Selected Financial Results - Net income was $163.0 million, or $3.08 per diluted share, $140.1 million, or $2.65 per diluted share, and $119.0 million, or $2.24 per diluted share, for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our prospective adoption of ASU 2016-09, ""Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting,"" resulted in favorable impacts to income tax expense and our net income from recording $5.2 million of excess tax benefits as a reduction to income tax expense in the first quarter 2017. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, we recorded deferred income tax expense of $2.2 million attributable to the remeasurement of ADIT associated with portions of our operating expenses not previously recovered in our rates. We operate in one reportable business segment: regulated public utilities that deliver natural gas to residential, commercial, industrial, wholesale, public authority and transportation customers. We evaluate our financial performance principally on operating income. The following table sets forth certain selected financial results for our operations for the periods indicated:  Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Financial Results 2017 2016 2015 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) (Millions of dollars, except percentages) Natural gas sales $ 1,409.1 $ 1,300.1 $ 1,417.9 $ 109.0 8 % $ (117.8 ) (8 )% Transportation revenues 100.9 98.1 98.8 2.8 3 % (0.7 ) (1 )% Cost of natural gas 614.5 541.8 706.0 72.7 13 % (164.2 ) (23 )% Net margin, excluding other revenues 895.5 856.4 810.7 39.1 5 % 45.7 6 % Other revenues 29.6 29.0 31.0 0.6 2 % (2.0 ) (6 )% Net margin 925.1 885.4 841.7 39.7 4 % 43.7 5 % Operating costs 473.7 472.5 469.6 1.2 - % 2.9 1 % Depreciation and amortization 151.9 143.8 133.0 8.1 6 % 10.8 8 % Operating income $ 299.5 $ 269.1 $ 239.1 $ 30.4 11 % $ 30.0 13 % Capital expenditures $ 356.4 $ 309.0 $ 294.3 $ 47.4 15 % $ 14.7 5 %  Net margin is comprised of total revenues less cost of natural gas. Cost of natural gas includes commodity purchases, fuel, storage, transportation and other gas purchase costs recovered through our cost of natural gas regulatory mechanisms and does not include an allocation of general operating costs or depreciation and amortization. In addition, our cost of natural gas regulatory mechanisms provide a method of recovering natural gas costs on an ongoing basis without a profit. Therefore, although our revenues will fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase, net margin is not affected by fluctuations in the cost of natural gas. The following table sets forth our net margin, excluding other revenues, by type of customer, for the periods indicated:  Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Net Margin, Excluding Other Revenues 2017 2016 2015 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Natural gas sales (Millions of dollars, except percentages) Residential $ 663.8 $ 629.8 $ 589.8 $ 34.0 5 % $ 40.0 7 % Commercial and industrial 124.2 121.7 115.6 2.5 2 % 6.1 5 % Wholesale and public authority 6.6 6.8 6.5 (0.2 ) (3 )% 0.3 5 % Net margin on natural gas sales 794.6 758.3 711.9 36.3 5 % 46.4 7 % Transportation revenues 100.9 98.1 98.8 2.8 3 % (0.7 ) (1 )% Net margin, excluding other revenues $ 895.5 $ 856.4 $ 810.7 $ 39.1 5 % $ 45.7 6 %  Our net margin on natural gas sales is comprised of two components, fixed and variable margin. Fixed margin reflects the portion of our net margin attributable to the monthly fixed customer charge component of our rates, which does not fluctuate based on customer usage in each period. Variable margin reflects the portion of our net margin that fluctuates with the volumes delivered and billed. We believe that the combination of the significant residential component of our customer base, the fixed charge component of our sales margin and our regulatory rate mechanisms in place result in a stable cash flow profile. The following table sets forth our net margin on natural gas sales by revenue type for the periods indicated:  Variances Variances Years Ended December 31, 2017 vs. 2016 2016 vs. 2015 Net Margin on Natural Gas Sales 2017 2016 2015 Increase (Decrease) Increase (Decrease) Net margin on natural gas sales (Millions of dollars, except percentages) Fixed margin $ 567.1 $ 557.5 $ 519.2 $ 9.6 2 % $ 38.3 7 % Variable margin 227.5 200.8 192.7 26.7 13 % 8.1 4 % Net margin on natural gas sales $ 794.6 $ 758.3 $ 711.9 $ 36.3 5 % $ 46.4 7 %  2017 vs. 2016 - Net margin increased $39.7 million due primarily to the following: an increase of $5.3 million from the impact of weather normalization mechanisms, which offset warmer than normal weather in 2017; an increase of $3.8 million due primarily to higher transportation volumes from customers in Kansas and Oklahoma; and an increase of $3.4 million in residential sales due primarily to net customer growth in Oklahoma and Texas.

OGS,"Mar 17, 2018 (Euclid Infotech Ltd via COMTEX) -- Governor Mary Fallin participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for Sofidel Group, an Italian manufacturer of tissue paper that announced a $360 million capital investment here. The project will include the construction of a new facility that will support 300 jobs in the Rogers County community. Sofidel will build here a new, modern integrated plant to serve the south-central and central-western areas of this great country, where we have been operating since 2012, said Luigi Lazzareschi, chief executive officer (CEO) of Sofidel Group. I am glad to announce this new greenfield investment the second one, after the first made in Ohio. This new investment will support our growth in the U.S. significantly. Sofidels Inola facility, expected to be operational by 2020, will have production capacity of 120,000 tons of tissue paper each year. The 1.8-million-square-feet plant is almost 40 percent larger than the Macys Fulfillment Center in north Tulsa County. We are excited that Sofidel has continued confidence to make this tremendous investment in Oklahoma, said Fallin. This global company has seen the advantages Oklahoma provides in its current operation, and now will double down with a state-of-the-art production facility in Inola. This is another example that our economic pro-business policies are diversifying Oklahomas economy. Coordinated by Tulsas Future, a a Tulsa Regional Chamber-led regional economic development plan supported by public and private investors, the project involves more partner entities than any in the plans 12-year history. Tulsas Future has now facilitated more than $675 million of capital investment in northeast Oklahoma since 2016, with a goal of $1.1 billion by 2020. We have been growing year after year at a very fast pace, said Lazzareschi. I would like to thank all the partners who have supported us in making this new project. They have played an integral role in helping us achieve this goal. Partners involved in the project include utility companies, tribal nations, and state and federal agencies. We welcome the arrival of Sofidel to northeast Oklahoma for its latest United States expansion, said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker. An international company like Sofidel locating here is a tribute to Oklahomas talented manufacturing workforce. Cherokee Nation has established a vital role in attracting new businesses to rural communities like Inola, where 300 permanent jobs and 500 construction jobs are a blessing to the local economy and schools. Were excited to continue partnering with state and municipal partners to create opportunities like this that benefit the Cherokee Nation and all of northeast Oklahoma. PSO is very pleased to work with state and local partners to bring this game-changing project to northeast Oklahoma, said Stuart Solomon, president and chief operating officer for Public Service Company of Oklahoma. Sofidels investment will bring much-needed jobs and an economic boost to Inola and the entire region. We are especially proud to be able to provide the site that helps make this project happen. This is exactly the type of high-impact project we hoped and expected to attract when we made the Inola River/Rail Site available for economic development. With easy access by highway, rail and the Verdigris River Navigation Channel, this site is primed to bring even more jobs and investment to the Inola area. We are proud to partner with our state, local and business leaders to attract new growth opportunities to the great state of Oklahoma through a highly collaborative economic development strategy, said Pierce Norton, president and CEO of ONE Gas. We all benefit from our states abundant natural gas supplies being in close proximity to where the resource is consumed, which allows our company to deliver reliable, affordable energy to businesses like Sofidel, which also recognizes that energy costs are critical to their companys competitive advantage. Public Service Company of Oklahoma, along with Rogers County and Inola leadership, recently invested in site preparation for the 1,100-acre Inola River/Rail Site to make it available for industrial development. The site was previously the location of a planned but cancelled nuclear power plant. Sofidel is going to have a huge impact on Inola and Rogers County, the Inola school system and Northeast Tech, and will eventually create significant benefit through new tax revenues, said Inola Mayor Larry Grigg. This comes about with groups such as the Tulsa Regional Chamber, Public Service Company of Oklahoma, Rogers County and the Rogers County Industrial Development Authority working together, along with the Town of Inola, to make this opportunity a reality. We are excited about the positive impact this will bring to the area. The Sofidel Group thoroughly researched a number of sites across the country before choosing Rogers County and the Inola community, said Rogers County Commissioner Ron Burrows. They chose Rogers County because we make good partners and good neighbors. This investment will benefit the entire county for decades to come. I look forward to continuing our close relationship and making Rogers County a great place for great businesses just like Sofidel. Sofidels investment is a great achievement for both the company and northeast Oklahoma, and a laurel for the Chambers economic development efforts, said Mike Neal, president and CEO of the Tulsa Regional Chamber. I commend all the partners involved for their hard work and diligence to secure this project. The direct result is the largest capital investment in our region in decades.","Mar 17, 2018 7:17 p.m. ET",N/A,United States : Gov.

Norton II, president and chief executive officer. ""Now that tax reform legislation is final, we look forward to working with our regulators to ensure our customers benefit from the lower tax rate."" FOURTH-QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ONE Gas reported operating income of $89.5 million in the fourth quarter 2017, compared with $78.5 million in the fourth quarter 2016. Net margin increased by $9.0 million compared with fourth quarter 2016, which primarily reflects: A $6.7 million increase from new rates primarily in Texas and Kansas; and A $2.1 million increase due to higher transportation volumes from customers in Kansas and Oklahoma. Fourth-quarter 2017 operating costs were $124.3 million, compared with $127.6 million in the fourth quarter 2016, which primarily reflects: A $5.9 million decrease in expenses from recording a regulatory asset as a result of the manufactured gas plant accounting order in Kansas; A $4.0 million decrease in environmental remediation costs; and A $1.3 million decrease in outside service expenses; offset partially by A $6.9 million increase in employee-related expenses. Fourth-quarter 2017 depreciation and amortization expense was $38.6 million, compared with $37.3 million in the fourth quarter 2016, due primarily to an increase in depreciation expense from capital investments placed in service. Capital expenditures were $107.3 million for the fourth quarter 2017, compared with $77.7 million in the fourth quarter 2016, due primarily to increased system integrity activities and extending service to new areas. Fourth-Quarter 2017 Key Statistics: More detailed information is listed in the tables. Actual heating degree days across the company's service areas were 3,604 in the fourth quarter 2017, 8 percent warmer than normal and 12 percent colder than the same period last year; Actual heating degree days in the Oklahoma service area were 1,272 in the fourth quarter 2017, 2 percent warmer than normal and 14 percent colder than the same period last year; Actual heating degree days in the Kansas service area were 1,744 in the fourth quarter 2017, 9 percent warmer than normal and 12 percent colder than the same period last year; Actual heating degree days in the Texas service area were 588 in the fourth quarter 2017, 19 percent warmer than normal and 6 percent colder than the same period last year; Residential natural gas sales volumes were 37.2 billion cubic feet (Bcf) in the fourth quarter 2017, up 4 percent compared with the same period last year; Total natural gas sales volumes were 48.7 Bcf in the fourth quarter 2017, up 3 percent compared with the same period last year; Natural gas transportation volumes were 53.0 Bcf in the fourth quarter 2017, down 1 percent compared with the same period last year; and Total natural gas volumes delivered were 101.7 Bcf in the fourth quarter 2017, up 1 percent compared with the same period last year. FULL-YEAR 2017 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Full-year 2017 operating income was $299.5 million, compared with $269.1 million in 2016. Net margin increased by $39.7 million compared with last year, which primarily reflects: A $26.7 million increase from new rates primarily in Texas and Kansas; A $5.3 million increase from the impact of weather normalization mechanisms, which offset warmer than normal weather in 2017; A $3.8 million increase due primarily to higher transportation volumes from customers in Kansas and Oklahoma; and A $3.4 million increase attributed to net residential customer growth in Oklahoma and Texas. 2017 operating costs were $473.7 million, compared with $472.5 million in 2016, which primarily reflects: An $8.4 million increase in employee-related expenses resulting from higher labor and compensation costs; A $2.9 million increase from the deferral of certain information technology services incurred with the separation from ONEOK, which was approved in 2016 as a regulatory asset in Oklahoma, and a deferral of regulatory expenses incurred previously in the fourth quarter of 2016, which was approved in the West Texas rate case as a regulatory asset; A $1.9 million increase in bad debt expense; and A $1.2 million increase in information technology expenses; offset partially by A $5.9 million decrease in expenses from recording a regulatory asset as a result of the manufactured gas plant accounting order in Kansas; A $4.0 million decrease related to higher environmental remediation costs in 2016; and A $3.4 million decrease in legal-related expenses. Full-year 2017 depreciation and amortization expense was $151.9 million, compared with $143.8 million in 2016, due primarily to an $11.0 million increase in depreciation expense from capital investments placed in service, offset partially by a decrease in the amortization of other post-employment benefit deferrals in Kansas. Full-year 2017 capital expenditures were $356.4 million, compared with $309.0 million in 2016, due primarily to increased expenditures for system integrity and extending service to new areas. The company ended the fourth quarter 2017 with $14.4 million of cash and cash equivalents, $357.2 million in commercial paper, no short-term borrowings and $2.1 million in letters of credit, leaving $340.7 million of credit available under its $700 million credit facility. The total debt-to-capitalization ratio at Dec. 31, 2017, was 44 percent, and the ratio of long-term debt-to-capitalization was 38 percent. > View earnings tables REGULATORY UPDATE Oklahoma In March 2017, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its first annual Performance-Based Rate Change (PBRC) following the general rate case that was approved in January 2016. The filing was based on a calendar test year of 2016. The PBRC filing demonstrated that Oklahoma Natural Gas was earning within the allowed return on equity range of 9.0 to 10.0 percent. Therefore, Oklahoma Natural Gas did not seek a modification to base rates. The filing also requested an energy-efficiency program true-up and a utility incentive adjustment of approximately $1.9 million. A joint stipulation and settlement agreement was approved by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission (OCC) in August 2017. As required, PBRC filings are made annually in March, until the next general rate case, which is currently required to be filed on or before June 30, 2021, based on a calendar test year of 2020. Tax Reform: In December 2017, the Oklahoma Attorney General filed a motion on behalf of customers in Oklahoma requesting that the OCC take action for an immediate reduction in rates and protection of ratepayers' interests. On January 9, 2018, the OCC approved an order directing Oklahoma Natural Gas to record a deferred liability beginning on the effective date of the order to reflect the reduced federal corporate tax rate of 21 percent and the associated savings in excess accumulated deferred income tax (ADIT) and any other tax implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on an interim basis subject to refund until utility rates are adjusted to reflect the federal tax savings and a final order is issued in Oklahoma Natural Gas' next scheduled PBRC proceeding. The order also directs Oklahoma Natural Gas, to the extent not already accrued for in its current PBRC tariff, to accrue interest at a rate equivalent to its cost of capital as recognized in the most recent PBRC filing on the amounts of any refunds determined to be owed to customers until issuance of a final order in the upcoming PBRC proceeding. Kansas In August 2017, Kansas Gas Service filed a request for interim rate relief under the Gas System Reliability Surcharge (GSRS) for an increase of approximately $2.9 million. In November 2017, the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) approved the increase, and new rates became effective December 2017. In April 2017, Kansas Gas Service filed an application with the KCC seeking approval of an Accounting Authority Order (AAO) associated with the costs incurred at and nearby 12 former manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites. Kansas Gas Service either owns or retains responsibility for certain environmental conditions at the MGP sites. In October 2017, Kansas Gas Service, the KCC staff and the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board (CURB) filed a unanimous settlement agreement with the KCC allowing Kansas Gas Service to defer and seek recovery of former MGP costs (costs that are necessary for investigation and remediation at the 12 former MGP sites) incurred after January 1, 2017, up to a cap of $15.0 million, net of any related insurance recoveries. Costs approved in a future rate proceeding would then be amortized over a 15-year period. The unamortized amounts will not be included in rate base or accumulate carrying charges. At the time future investigation and remediation work, net of any related insurance recoveries, is expected to exceed $15.0 million, Kansas Gas Service will be required to file an application with the KCC for approval to increase the $15.0 million cap. The KCC issued an order approving the settlement agreement in November 2017. A regulatory asset of approximately $5.9 million was recorded for estimated costs that were accrued at January 1, 2017. Tax Reform: On January 18, 2018, the KCC opened a general investigation for the purposes of examining the financial impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on regulated public utilities operating in Kansas. The KCC also granted a KCC Staff recommendation: (1) to issue an AAO requiring utilities to track and accumulate, in a deferred revenue account, the portion of their revenue that results from the use of a 35 percent federal corporate tax rate for their last KCC- approved revenue determination instead of the new lower federal corporate tax rate; (2) that the deferrals commence on the effective date of the new federal corporate tax rate; (3) that the KCC express its intent to capture excess ADIT in a manner consistent with the tax normalization rules; and (4) that the portion of current rates affected by federal tax reform should be considered interim and subject to refund with interest compounded monthly at the rate for customer deposits, until the KCC has an opportunity to evaluate the reasonableness of those rates with new lower federal tax rates. Texas Rio Grande Valley Service Area: In January 2018, Texas Gas Service reached a settlement with the Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) staff in the unincorporated areas of the Rio Grande Valley service area. This settlement, if approved by the RRC, will result in an increase in revenues of $0.5 million with new rates expected to be effective by April 2018. The underlying revenue requirement reflects a corporate income tax rate of 21 percent and requires Texas Gas Service to calculate, defer and begin refunding to customers the rate reductions resulting from federal tax reform that would have occurred between January 1, 2018, and the effective date of the new rates. In June 2017, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case for customers in the incorporated areas of its Rio Grande Valley service area. Texas Gas Service and the cities in the Rio Grande Valley service area agreed to an increase of $3.6 million, and new rates became effective in October 2017. West Texas Service Area: In March 2017, Texas Gas Service made filings under the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP) for all customers in the West Texas service area. The RRC and the cities approved an increase of $4.3 million, and new rates went into effect in July 2017. Central Texas Service Area: In March 2017, Texas Gas Service made filings under the GRIP for all customers in the consolidated Central Texas service area. The RRC and cities approved an increase of $4.9 million, and new rates became effective in June 2017. Other Service Areas: In the normal course of business, Texas Gas Service has received approval for increases totaling $1.4 million in 2017 for rate relief under the GRIP and cost-of-service adjustments in other Texas jurisdictions to address investments in rate base and changes in expenses. Tax Reform: On January 23, 2018, the RRC directed Commission staff to analyze the impact of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 on current gas utility rates and to develop recommendations to ensure that, beginning January 1, 2018, all gas utility customers in Texas receive the full benefit of federal tax reform. 2018 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE On Jan. 16, 2018, ONE Gas announced that its 2018 net income is expected to be in the range of $156 million to $168 million, or $2.96 to $3.20 per diluted share. Capital expenditures are expected to be $375 million in 2018, with 70 percent of these expenditures targeted for system integrity and replacement projects. Rate base in 2018 is expected to average $3.4 billion, with 42 percent in Oklahoma, 30 percent in Kansas and 28 percent in Texas. ONE Gas expects to achieve a 7.3 percent return on equity in 2018, which is calculated consistent with utility ratemaking in each jurisdiction.

The dividend is payable March 09, 2018, to shareholders of record at the close of business February 23, 2018. ONE Gas expects an average annual dividend increase of 7% to 9% between 2017 and 2022, with a target dividend payout ratio of 55% to 65% of net income, all subject to its Board of Directors' approval. ONE Gas' indicated dividend represents a yield of 2.70%, considerably above compared to the average dividend yield of 2.52% for the Utilities sector. The Company has raised dividend for two years in a row. Dividend Insight ONE Gas has a dividend payout ratio of 59.7%, which denotes that the Company spends approximately $0.60 for dividend distribution out of every $1.00 earned. The dividend payout ratio reflects how much amount a company is returning to shareholders versus how much money it is keeping on hand to reinvest in growth, to pay off debt, and/or to add to its cash reserves. According to analysts' estimates, ONE Gas is forecasted to report earnings of $3.12 for the next year, which is substantially higher than the Company's annualized dividend of $1.84 per share. ONE Gas ended Q3 2017 with $6.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $174.0 million in short-term borrowings, and $1.8 million in letters of credit, leaving $524.2 million of credit available under its $700 million credit facility. The Company's total debt-to-capitalization ratio at September 30, 2017, was 41%, and the ratio of long-term debt to capitalization was 38%. The Company's balance sheet remains strong and it is well positioned over the long-term to sustain its dividend distribution.

OGS,"TULSA, Okla., Jan. 16, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- ONE Gas, Inc. OGS, -0.71% today announced that its 2018 net income is expected to be in the range of $156 million to $168 million, or $2.96 to $3.20 per diluted share. The midpoint for ONE Gas' 2018 net income guidance is $162 million, or $3.08 per diluted share. ONE Gas' 2018 earnings guidance primarily reflects the benefit of new rates and normal weather in its service territories and a $0.04 per diluted share contribution from the share-based compensation accounting standard that was adopted in the first quarter of 2017. These benefits are offset partially by higher depreciation expense due to capital investments. The impacts of the recently signed tax reform legislation and expected regulatory treatment have also been incorporated into guidance. ONE Gas expects to achieve a 7.3 percent return on equity (ROE) in 2018, which assumes an average rate base of $3.4 billion and is calculated consistent with utility ratemaking in each jurisdiction. ONE Gas also increased its 2017 net income guidance to $3.06 to $3.10 per diluted share, compared with its previously announced range of $2.94 to $3.04 per diluted share. Included in the 2017 EPS guidance range is $0.10 per share contribution from adoption of the share-based compensation accounting standard in the first quarter of 2017, which was included in the previous guidance. Also included in the updated guidance is a $0.07 per share contribution from the accounting authority order approved by the Kansas Corporation Commission in the fourth quarter of 2017 and a $0.04 per share negative impact from the recently signed tax reform legislation, neither of which were included in the previous guidance. Capital expenditures are expected to be $375 million in 2018, with 70 percent of these expenditures targeted for system integrity and replacement projects. Guidance estimates may be impacted by the variables listed in the forward-looking statements below. Additional information is available in the guidance table on the ONE Gas website. FIVE-YEAR GROWTH FORECAST UPDATED ONE Gas expects net income and earnings per share to increase by an average of 5 to 7 percent annually between 2017 and 2022; however, the timing and frequency of regulatory filings will impact the growth rate in any individual year. ONE Gas' rate base is expected to grow an average of 6.0 to 6.5 percent per year between 2017 and 2022. Capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $375 million to $415 million per year between 2018 and 2022, with more than 70 percent of these expenditures targeted for system integrity and replacement projects. ONE Gas' previous five-year capital expenditures guidance range was $350 million to $380 million per year between 2017 and 2021. ONE Gas expects its average annual dividend growth rate to be 7 to 9 percent between 2017 and 2022, with a target dividend payout ratio of 55 to 65 percent of net income, all subject to its board of directors' approval.

""I would like to thank our employees for their continued focus and commitment to serving our customers safely and reliably while efficiently managing expenses."" THIRD-QUARTER 2017 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE ONE Gas reported operating income of $40.8 million in the third quarter 2017, compared with $30.9 million in the third quarter 2016. Net margin increased by $8.4 million compared with third quarter 2016, which primarily reflects: A $5.7 million increase from new rates in Texas and Kansas; A $1.0 million increase attributed to net residential customer growth in Oklahoma and Texas; and A $0.9 million increase from the impact of the modified weather-normalization mechanism in Kansas. Third-quarter 2017 operating costs were $109.1 million, compared with $112.7 million in the third quarter 2016, which primarily reflects: A $1.6 million decrease in costs associated with pipeline maintenance activities; and A $1.3 million decrease in legal expenses. Third-quarter 2017 depreciation and amortization expense was $38.4 million, compared with $36.3 million in the third quarter 2016, due primarily to an increase in depreciation expense from capital investments placed in service. Capital expenditures were $94.4 million for the third quarter 2017, compared with $86.5 million in the third quarter 2016, due primarily to increased system integrity activities and extending service to new areas. Key Statistics: More detailed information is listed in the tables. Residential natural gas sales volumes were 7.4 billion cubic feet (Bcf) in the third quarter 2017, relatively unchanged compared with the same period last year; Total natural gas sales volumes were 11.5 Bcf in the third quarter 2017, up 2 percent compared with the same period last year; Natural gas transportation volumes were 46.4 Bcf in the third quarter 2017, up 1 percent compared with the same period last year; and Total natural gas volumes delivered were 57.9 Bcf in the third quarter 2017, up 1 percent compared with the same period last year. YEAR-TO-DATE 2017 FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE Operating income for the nine-month 2017 period was $210.0 million, compared with $190.6 million for the same period last year. Net margin increased by $30.7 million compared with the same period last year, which primarily reflects: A $20.0 million increase from new rates in Texas and Kansas; A $5.5 million increase from the impact of weather-normalization mechanisms, which offset warmer weather in 2017 compared with the same period in 2016; A $2.7 million increase attributed to residential customer growth in Oklahoma and Texas; and A $1.7 million increase due primarily to higher transportation volumes from customers in Oklahoma and Kansas. Operating costs for the nine-month 2017 period were $349.4 million, compared with $344.9 million for the same period last year, which primarily reflects: A $2.4 million increase from the deferral in the first quarter of 2016 of certain information technology services incurred with the separation from ONEOK in 2014, which was approved in Oklahoma as a regulatory asset; A $1.7 million increase in information technology expenses; A $1.5 million increase in employee-related expenses; A $1.0 million increase in bad debt expense; and A $0.8 million increase in costs associated with pipeline maintenance activities; offset partially by A $3.1 million decrease in legal expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense for the nine-month 2017 period was $113.3 million, compared with $106.5 million for the same period last year, due primarily to an increase in depreciation expense from capital investments placed in service. Capital expenditures for the nine-month 2017 period were $249.1 million, compared with $231.3 million for the same period last year, due primarily to increased system integrity activities and extending service to new areas. The company ended the third quarter 2017 with $6.9 million of cash and cash equivalents, $174.0 million in short-term borrowings and $1.8 million in letters of credit, leaving $524.2 million of credit available under its $700 million credit facility. The total debt-to-capitalization ratio at Sept. 30, 2017, was 41 percent, and the ratio of long-term debt to capitalization was 38 percent. > View earnings tables REGULATORY ACTIVITY Oklahoma In March 2017, Oklahoma Natural Gas filed its first annual Performance-Based Rate Change (PBRC) following the general rate case that was approved in January 2016. The filing was based on a calendar test year of 2016. The PBRC filing demonstrated that Oklahoma Natural Gas was earning within the allowed range of  9.0 to 10.0 percent. Therefore, Oklahoma Natural Gas did not seek a modification in base rates. The filing also requested an energy-efficiency program true-up and a utility incentive adjustment of approximately $1.9 million. A joint stipulation and settlement agreement was approved by the Oklahoma Corporation Commission in August 2017. As required, PBRC filings are made annually in March, until the next general rate case, which is currently required to be filed on or before June 30, 2021, based on a calendar test year of 2020. Kansas In August 2017, Kansas Gas Service filed a request for interim rate relief under the Gas System Reliability Surcharge (GSRS) for an increase of approximately $2.9 million. If approved, new rates are expected to be effective January 2018. GSRS is a capital-recovery mechanism that allows for a rate adjustment providing recovery of and a return on incremental safety-related and government-mandated capital investments made between rate cases. In April 2017, Kansas Gas Service filed an application with the Kansas Corporation Commission (KCC) seeking approval of an Accounting Authority Order associated with the costs incurred at, and nearby, its 12 manufactured gas plant (MGP) sites. In October 2017, Kansas Gas Service, the KCC staff and the Citizens' Utility Ratepayer Board filed a unanimous settlement agreement with the KCC. If approved, the agreement will allow Kansas Gas Service to defer MGP costs for the investigation and remediation at the 12 former MGP sites incurred after January 1, 2017, up to a cap of $15.0 million, net of any related insurance recoveries. Costs approved in a future rate proceeding would then be amortized over a 15-year period. The unamortized amounts will not be included in rate base or accumulate carrying charges. At the time future investigation and remediation work, net of any related insurance recoveries, is expected to exceed $15.0 million, Kansas Gas Service will be required to file an application with the KCC for approval to increase the $15.0 million cap. The KCC is expected to issue an order no later than early January 2018. If the agreement is approved, a regulatory asset of approximately $5.9 million will be recorded for estimated costs that have been accrued at January 1, 2017. Texas Rio Grande Valley Service Area: In June 2017, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case for customers in its Rio Grande Valley service area. Texas Gas Service and the cities in the Rio Grande Valley service area agreed to an increase of $3.6 million, and new rates became effective in October 2017. In October 2017, Texas Gas Service filed a rate case requesting an increase in revenues of $0.5 million for the unincorporated areas of its Rio Grande Valley service area. If approved, new rates are expected to be effective in the fourth quarter 2017. West Texas Service Area: In March 2017, Texas Gas Service made filings under the Gas Reliability Infrastructure Program (GRIP) for all customers in the West Texas service area. The Texas Railroad Commission (RRC) and the cities approved an increase of $4.3 million, and new rates became effective in July 2017. Central Texas Service Area: In March 2017, Texas Gas Service made filings under the GRIP for customers of the consolidated Central Texas service area. The RRC and the cities approved an increase of $4.9 million, and new rates became effective in June 2017. Other Service Areas: In the normal course of business, Texas Gas Service has received approval for increases totaling $1.4 million in 2017 for rate relief under the GRIP and cost-of-service adjustments in other Texas jurisdictions to address investments in rate base and changes in expenses. 2017 FINANCIAL GUIDANCE AFFIRMED ONE Gas affirmed its 2017 financial guidance, which was updated July 31, 2017, with net income expected to be in the range of $155 million to $161 million, or approximately $2.94 to $3.04 per diluted share. Capital expenditures are expected to be within a range of $350 million to $360 million in 2017.  More than 70 percent of these expenditures are targeted for system integrity and replacement projects.
