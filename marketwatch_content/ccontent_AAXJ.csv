AAXJ,"The Trump rally is over — run for the hills! No, wait — it’s getting its groove back. So which is it? Surely, a look at sectors will reveal all, clearing the air after this up-and-down month. Nope. “Normally, certain sectors lead in strong markets, and different ones lead in weaker markets,” notes Michael Kahn, Barron’s resident technician. “Right now, there’s little rhyme or reason to the leaders and laggards — and that keeps the level of uncertainty relatively high for stocks,” he says. Rather than join in the endless debate between the bulls and bears, you could just look for a Trump trade that still has room to run, even as others stumble. The Macro Man blog’s Abee Crombie may have delivered exactly that for our call of the day. “If you want to play the global reflation theme, you really should be looking at Asia ex Japan 899800, +0.01%  ,” the financial blogger says. “Earnings estimates have been on the rise in 2017. And don’t look now, but it’s been positive almost every day this year.” Sure, some pundits say the reflation trade might not have that much to do with our new president, while others say it’s at least “Trump inspired.” Regardless, Abee Crombie’s pick for betting on reflation is sporting a nice year-to-date gain. The big U.S.-listed ETF AAXJ, +1.80%  that tracks MSCI’s Asia ex-Japan stock index is up 16% in 2017, as of yesterday’s close. Talk about power swinging over to the Pacific. And the iShares Asia ex Japan ETF stands well below its all-time high, unlike the main U.S. stock indexes. That potentially makes it less scary for investors to plunk new money in it. (The ETF has $2.9 billion in investor cash at the moment, according to ETF.com data). The fund’s biggest holding is Samsung 005930, +0.37% SSNLF, -3.07%  , which has weathered all sorts of drama remarkably well. Key market gauges Futures for the S&P 500 US:ESM7   , Dow US:YMM7  and Nasdaq-100 US:NQM7  are flat to slightly lower this morning. That’s after the S&P SPX, +1.38% and Nasdaq Composite COMP, +1.64%  both closed modestly higher yesterday, while the Dow DJIA, +1.07% lost ground. The S&P is down 0.1% in March, as of yesterday’s close, and up 5.5% in the first quarter. It’s 1.5% below its March 1 record close. Across the Pacific, the Shanghai benchmark SHCOMP, +0.26%  suffered its biggest intraday drop this year, as one analyst said Asian markets are “confused.” See the Market Snapshot column for the latest action. The chart LPL The S&P 500 has gained 2% on average in April over the past 20 years, notes LPL Financial’s Ryan Detrick. “Whether it’s because of tax returns being used to buy equities, last-minute retirement fund contributions, or simply happier moods as the days get warmer, April tends to be one of the strongest months historically. In fact, over the past 20 years, no other month has had a higher average return,” he writes. But if you look back to 1928 or to 1950, April is only the third-strongest month, Detrick adds.

AAXJ,"The stock market is an ongoing tale of greed and fear, overvaluation and undervaluation, and of styles and trends. And while I tend to focus my firm's work over a three-year period instead of shorter time frames, I find we can learn a lot by stepping back at the end of each quarter to take a snapshot of the market as that ongoing tale plays out. Below, I share with you an analysis I do with my research team each quarter, in which we analyze the broad market's returns, then focus on a variety of stock market segments we find to be either of long-term or current interest. The tables below show returns of these areas, as represented by ETFs, which make slicing and dicing the market more accessible for investment strategists, professional and amateur alike. This time around, I show you the performance for the first quarter of this year (through the market close of March 31) of 23 different market segment ETFs, grouped in a way that helps tell the story I see. I also show you the three-year trailing return and dividend yield, which are important factors in my own work.

In the first quarter, it paid off for some more than others. Defensive and high-quality investing did very well, but higher-volatility (i.e. high-beta) stocks lost money. Contrarian (a.k.a. deep value) investing was a big winner, but volatile as ever. Finally, so-called “wide moat” businesses (those with perceived competitive advantages from size, scale, brand or other factors) had a strong quarter.

The utilities sector was maligned for much of last year as fears of higher interest rates and other false assumptions suppressed prices. But utilities stocks came roaring back over the past three months. This had a big, positive impact on the four largest dividend ETFs (VYM, DVY, SDY, HDV). But, as shown here, there can be wide differences in short-term performance in this market space, as many of those funds tend to “settle” for stocks whose yields are higher than average, but not by much. The one ETF shown here that invests in very high-yield stocks (while courting much higher risk) outperformed the broad market but underperformed higher-quality yield funds. This has been the case over the past few years.

But in the first quarter, big-name energy companies did OK. Were they volatile as heck? Sure. Did they finish the quarter positive? Yes, quite. Have they bottomed? Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. After all, their relatives, the MLP sector, was once again tough sledding. And social-media stocks, which seem to have a love-hate relationship with investors, were a source of stress in the quarter. This is just a cursory review, from which additional research and strategic thinking can be done down to the company level. I think it can help you to gain a better sense of what we call your ""performance attribution"" — that is, which market factors influenced how you did. Naturally, this does not include the performance one can potentially generate from stock selection, but it does go at least ""knee deep"" by analyzing well beyond the headline index returns that investors pay way too much attention to.

AAXJ,"ETF Daily Investors Thursday focused on a heavy dose of mixed economic data. With the long Memorial Day Holiday ahead, bulls were working on a ""stick save"" for the week. Overseas data also was mixed Thursday. China PMI Mfg Index rose but still sub-50 indicating weakness (49.7 vs. 48.3 expected and a prior 48.1); and Europe PMI Mfg Index declined (52.5 vs. 53.2 expected and a prior 53.4). U.S. data included jobless claims which fell (326,000 vs 310,000 expected and a prior 298,000); leading indicators fell (0.4% vs. 0.4% expected and a prior 0.8%). The Chicago Fed Activity Index fell (- 0.32 vs. a prior 0.34); existing home sales were better (4.65 million vs. 4.69 million expected and a prior 4.59 million). The PMI Manufacturing Index jumped (56.2 vs. 55.9 expected and a prior 55.4). In early trading bulls chose to focus on the positive PMI data and adroitly ignored what didn't please them.

Chart of the day iShares Russell 2000 Small Cap Index ETF (IWM) once again is shown on the weekly chart below. We've posted this market view a few times recently to demonstrate a possible bottom as the low (LO) indicator has accurately shown. Volume disappeared again on Thursday, challenging rally's credibility. Breadth per the WSJ was positive.  The NYMO is a market breadth indicator that is based on the difference between the number of advancing and declining issues on the NYSE. When readings are +60/-60 markets are extended short-term. The McClellan Summation Index is a long-term version of the McClellan Oscillator. It is a market breadth indicator, and interpretation is similar to that of the McClellan Oscillator, except that it is more suited to major trends. I believe readings of +1000/-1000 reveal markets as much extended. The VIX VIX, -12.68%  is a widely used measure of market risk and is often referred to as the ""investor fear gauge.” Our own interpretation is highlighted in the chart above. The VIX measures the level of put option activity over a 30-day period. Greater buying of put options (protection) causes the index to rise.  Friday should bring another light volume trading day as traders rather leave their posts early. Bond markets close early on Friday. Economic data is limited to important new home sales.

AAXJ,"HONG KONG (MarketWatch) — Most Asian markets on Tuesday gained as fears about the euro zone subsided, with Japan recovering strongly due to a weaker yen and Australia falling following the latest Reserve Bank of Australia minutes. S&P: Brighter Outlook for China Property Market Regional stocks were the first to respond on Monday to news over the weekend that Cyprus planned to impose a tax on its depositors to lessen the cost of rescuing its financial system. Worries that the euro-zone crisis was flaring up again pushed the broad MSCI Asia ex-Japan index US:AAXJ  down 1.3% on Monday. But Asia appeared to have overreacted, as other regions posted more moderate declines. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index XX:SXXP   closed 0.2% lower on Monday, rebounding from a 1.2% intraday fall; while in the U.S., the Dow Jones Industrial Average US:DJIA   lost 0.4%. The U.S. dollar rose against the yen, US:USDJPY  recovering completely from Monday’s losses, and was at 95.38 late in Asia compared with 95.21 late Monday in New York. The euro US:EURUSD  was stable for most of the Asian session, though it dipped as the day progressed to $1.2922, compared with $1.2956 late Monday in New York. The single currency remained well above its lowest level since Dec. 10 at $1.288, touched during the previous session. Bank of Japan meeting The next event on the horizon for the yen is the Bank of Japan’s April policy meeting, where expectations are high that the central bank’s new leadership team will implement a more aggressive monetary policy. The U.S. dollar’s recovery against the yen translated into a rebound for Japanese stocks, with the Nikkei Stock Average JP:100000018  up 2% at 12,468.23. The market was hit particularly hard on Monday when it fell 2.7%, its biggest percentage decline in 10 months. “Monday’s reaction to the Cyprus situation wasn’t unexpected given stocks’ stellar performance over the past several weeks,” said Nicholas Smith, equity strategist at CLSA in Tokyo. Large constituents in the Nikkei that dipped in the previous session recovered on Tuesday. Exporters also recovered, supported by the weaker yen. Fast Retailing, US:FRCOY JP:9983  the company behind the Uniqlo chain of shops, added 2.8% and Canon US:CAJ JP:7751  rose 3.1%. Other markets that recovered on Tuesday include South Korea, where the Kospi KR:SEU   ended up 0.5% at 1,978.56; the Shanghai Composite CN:000001   in mainland China, which closed 0.8% higher at 2,257.43; and Singapore’s Strait Times Index, SG:STI  which finished up 0.4% at 3,269,13. Australian stocks started the day higher, but their recovery ground to a halt after minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia’s March 5 policy meeting were published. Although the central bank said that a further cut in rates could be required, the minutes were taken as a sign that the central bank is unlikely to cut interest rates. The S&P ASX 200 AU:XJO   reversed a gain and ended in negative territory, down 0.6% at 4987.40. The other major market that failed to gain was Hong Kong, where the Hang Seng Index HK:HSI  lost 0.2% to 22,041.86. But a notable mover in Hong Kong was Samsonite International, US:SMSEY HK:1910  which jumped 4.6% after the market welcomed the luggage company’s latest set of earnings.

AAXJ,"(This article was originally published Thursday.) --Institutional money manager moves back into stocks, citing likelihood of more stimulus action by central bankers --Chinese stocks seen as ready for improved performance --Portfolio manager advises clients to keep more dry powder on-hand in case policymakers crank up printing presses With expectations mounting that central bankers are ready to pump more liquidity into global financial markets, managers at RiverFront Investment Group say they're becoming a bit less cautious about stocks. In particular, they've increased their exposure to exchange-traded funds focused on Europe and Asia, says Michael Jones, who helps oversee $3.2 billion in assets as chairman and chief investment officer at the Richmond, Va., institutional money management firm. Last week, RiverFront moved into the DBX MSCI EAFE Hedged Equity DBEF, +0.82% It's a fund designed to remove any possible foreign currency influence on long-only stock positions in its MSCI benchmark, which tracks key developed markets outside the U.S. ""Investing in this ETF provides us with more pure exposure to major international stock markets from Europe to Japan,"" Mr. Jones said. RiverFront has also been buying the Vanguard MSCI Europe ETF (VGK). ""Since European policymakers have made so many mistakes in the past, investors remain incredibly skeptical of the region's potential going forward,"" Mr. Jones said. ""But we see progress, from more lenient bailout terms being offered to Spanish banks to the increased likelihood that the ECB (European Central Bank) will take a bigger role in stabilizing debt markets."" At the start of June, RiverFront moved out of the SPDR Gold Shares GLD, +0.05% It replaced those positions, which equated to about 3% of total assets in client accounts, with the Vanguard Large-Cap ETF VV, +1.45% ""Gold looks fairly overvalued at this point, especially compared to equities,"" Mr. Jones said. ""If sovereign debt issues in Spain and Italy become less of a concern, GLD's safe-haven status will make it less appealing."" Meanwhile, RiverFront's portfolio managers say China looks ""too beaten up"" by investors worried about a hard landing for the powerhouse economy. The country should lean more in favor of loosening borrowing costs and promoting growth in coming quarters, Mr. Jones predicts. Still, he's steering investors away from standalone China funds, preferring the iShares MSCI All Country Asia ex-Japan AAXJ, +1.80% ""We don't mind having some exposure, but we're much more comfortable with the accounting standards and management incentives in markets like Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan and so forth. Those are all represented well in the iShares ETF,"" Mr. Jones said. Such moves back into stocks should be tempered by the fact that Jones and his staff have been playing markets rather conservatively up until this month, says Kent Elliott, director of investments for the Elliott-Schmitt Group at Robert W. Baird & Co. in Roseville, Calif. The advisory firm, which oversees $170 million in assets, uses portfolios designed by RiverFront for its high net-worth and institutional clients. ""They've started to dip their toes back into the market and become less cautious,"" Mr. Elliott said. ""It reminds us of last fall when RiverFront looked into the abyss of world markets and started buying stocks again."" RiverFront's moderate growth portfolios have edged up to about 56% in equities, up from less than 50% a few week ago, Mr. Jones notes. ""Our investment thesis is to move back into stocks by emphasizing higher dividend paying ETFs to remain extra conservative,"" he said. ""At the same time, we're increasing risk on the bond side by emphasizing high-yield funds."" According to the firm's outside audited results reported to clients, such a flagship moderate growth portfolio gained 6.1% in the first quarter. That compared to a 6.3% return during that same period for its composite benchmark using an equal mix of bonds and stocks. But since its inception in 2003 the strategy has produced an average annualized 7.3% compared to 5.9% for the blended index. The investment tack traces its roots to Mr. Jones' days as CIO at Wachovia Securities, which was bought by Wells Fargo & Co. (WFC) in 2008. ""To keep momentum going, we need to see Greek elections on June 17 turn out right. Our expectation is that Greece won't vote to effectively exit the euro,"" Mr. Jones said. Just in case, RiverFront is still maintaining a bigger cash pile than normal. ""We've put a significant amount to work already, but we're still keeping some dry powder on the sidelines. Volatility is likely to remain high no matter how aggressive policymakers in Europe combat the region's debut issues.""

AAXJ,"BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Exchange-traded funds to gain exposure to China and Asia's emerging economies could make sense for some investors, if they're ready for bumpy markets that have recently endured violent boom-and-bust cycles, Japan's lost decade and currency crises. The largest ETF in the Asian-stock category is iShares FTSE/Xinhua China 25 Index Fund FXI, +1.26% with nearly $8 billion in assets. It is also one of the more liquid U.S.-listed ETFs with average daily volume of about 37.4 million shares over the trailing month, according to FactSet Research. With its burgeoning middle class and solid export base, China is seen as a growing driver of the world economy. There are signs the Chinese economy is recovering faster than the rest of the world after the global financial meltdown.   INVESTING IN ASIA Beat the tide Asia still offers opportunities for long-term investors, analysts say. China, India and Indonesia are markets with potential. • Risks, rewards of 'going local' • Diversity in a diverse region • China makes good entry point • Using ETF's to invest in Asia • Watch China consumers • Growth opportunities The iShares FTSE/Xinhua China ETF tracks an index of the 25 largest and most liquid Chinese companies -- all the stocks trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. ""The fund's low correlation to the U.S. market make it a decent diversification tool, especially for investors with insufficient exposure to emerging markets,"" said Morningstar Inc. analyst Patricia Oey in a profile of the ETF. ""However, while investing in China may seem very attractive given the country's long-term growth outlook, we remind investors that Chinese stocks can be very volatile,"" she wrote. With an expense ratio of 0.73%, the ETF offers ""cheap and efficient exposure to the Chinese market, but the sector allocations may result in unbalanced exposure to various parts of the economy,"" notes Michael Johnston, senior analyst at ETF Database. Roughly 45% of the portfolio is concentrated in the financial sector, for example. ""There is concern that bubbles have emerged in the country's housing and stock markets, and a correction would certainly weigh on the performance of this fund, which has a significant weighting in the financials sector,"" Morningstar's Oey warned. ""If a global economic recovery proceeds slower than expected, the Chinese economy could face a hard landing in 2010 after a year of easy credit and government stimulus spending,"" she said, adding that political unrest is another risk for investors. There are many other ETFs that invest in China, including PowerShares Golden Dragon Halter USX China Portfolio PGJ, +2.08% SPDR S&P China ETF GXC, +1.64% and Claymore/AlphaShares China Small Cap ETF HAO, +2.17% For traders who want to bet against the market, ProShares UltraShort FTSE/Xinhua China 25 FXP, -2.86% is a daily-leveraged ETF geared to profit when Chinese stocks fall. Among other Asian single-country funds, iShares MSCI Japan Index Fund EWJ, +1.27% ranks as one of the largest with nearly $5 billion in assets. Japan's lost decade has made it tough on investors -- through June 11, the ETF had a 10-year annualized return of negative 3.7%, according to Morningstar. The iShares MSCI Pacific ex-Japan Index Fund EPP, +1.04% is another popular choice that covers the broader region. The $3.4 billion fund invests primarily in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore and New Zealand. ""There are a few Asia region ETFs, which can be roughly divided into two subcategories -- developed markets and emerging markets,"" said Oey, the Morningstar analyst.

AAXJ,"HEALDSBURG, Calif. (MarketWatch) -- Investing in Asian stocks while the wind was under their wings from 2002-2007 was like flying a kite on a breezy day. But if you missed those golden years, you may have another chance coming. If you are not invested in foreign stocks now, I can't blame you. Without a weakening U.S. dollar to give you a currency-profit cushion, it's been a very bumpy ride. Indeed, over the past year it has been wise to stay out of foreign stocks, which fell faster and further than U.S. stocks. Foreign stocks may still be trying for investors but as the Fed focuses on keeping U.S. interest rates down, the wind is clearly shifting as the dollar once again begins to tumble. That gives investors in Asia and other emerging markets an advantage. A weakening U.S. dollar against emerging market currencies fueled the extra profit that investing in the Asian markets and their natural resources suppliers (Australia, Brazil, Russia and Canada) enjoyed from 2002-2007. But a strengthening dollar took Asian stocks and funds off investors' menu for the past couple of years. It's time to dig in again. Shift in the wind In the past 10 market days, Asian stock markets and their major raw-material suppliers began to rally after a 53% plunge from last May's high on the BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India and China) index. While Asian markets have been in a trading range for most of the last six months, the strong devaluation of the U.S. dollar over the past week may trigger a longer-term rally. There is a lot of upside potential and downside risk has been greatly diminished. The BRIC index is close to breaking its next upside resistance level -- after which the sky is the limit. Asia and its natural resource suppliers will benefit from increased infrastructure spending. The past 10 trading days tell the story. The strongest growth opportunities have been among Asian markets and providers of commodities (cement, copper, oil and the like). Just look at these 10-day exchange-traded fund returns: Russia RSX, +2.66% up 51.1%; BRIC S&P 40 SPDR BIK, +1.77% up 32%; MSCI Australia EWA, +0.82% up 29.4% (buoyed by the Australian dollar index FXA, +0.33% which rose 12.1%); MSCI Brazil EWZ, +3.08% up 28.8% (the Brazilian real index BZF, -1.18% rose 11.6%); China Xinhua 25 FXI, +1.26% up 27.6%; S&P Latin American 40 ILF, +2.59% gaining 27.4%, and MSCI Singapore EWS, +2.42% rising 16.8%. In addition, the MSCI All-Asia ex Japan AAXJ, +1.80% rose 28.1% and the Emerging Market 50 ADRE, +2.37% rose 26.3%, confirming the broad rises in both Asian and emerging markets. Gold miners leave dust The exceptions to the rally are the Chinese yuan CYB, -0.29% up 0.3%, the Japanese yen FXY, +0.58% up 0.5% and Gold Bullion GLD, +0.05% up 1.3%. But an index of gold mining shares GDX, +1.48% rose 21.3%. In a strong rally, this is not unusual. Consider this simplified example: if gold were at $900 and went to $990, the bullion has gained 10%. But if you are producing gold at a cost of $810 an ounce, your profits have doubled. Hence the gold mining shares have much greater upside potential (and downside risk as well). As the Chinese say, ""May you live in interesting times."" The deliberately weakened dollar makes Asian investments interesting indeed. While Washington rolls the dice and burns our bucks, Asia cooks up a strong brew. Go east. More from MarketWatch Can the Democrats Ride a Blue Wave to Midterm Election Wins?
