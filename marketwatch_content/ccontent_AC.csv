AC,"Accor SA (AC.FR) said Wednesday that net profit for 2017 rose, driven by strong business in the majority of its key markets, namely Asia-Pacific and Europe. The French hotel group said net profit was 441 million euros ($545 million) compared with EUR265 million the year previous. Revenue for the year was EUR1.94 billion, said the company. In July, the company announced its intention to spin off and dispose of its real-estate operations, united under AccorInvest. The company said it is in the final stages of talks with investors over the opening up of the capital of AccorInvest. Earnings before interest and taxes was EUR492 million, up from EUR397 million the year previous, said Accor. The company said EBIT in its new businesses unit was affected by an increase in amortization linked to acquisitions made in 2017, and that it expects to halve the loss in 2018.","Feb 21, 2018 1:52 a.m. ET",1,Accor profit up on strong business in key markets,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/accor-profit-up-on-strong-business-in-key-markets-2018-02-21
AC,"SYDNEY--Mantra Group Ltd. (MTR.AU) said it has agreed to a more than US$900 million cash offer from France's Accor SA (AC.FR), bringing together the two largest hotels groups in Australia. The proposed takeover builds on the merger activity in the industry in recent years as hotel companies have sought increased scale to fend off aggressive home-rental companies and online travel agents. Mantra has more than 125 properties across Australia and New Zealand and a growing footprint in Indonesia and Hawaii. Mantra said its directors unanimously recommended shareholders accept Accor's offer of about 1.18 billion Australian dollars (US$920 million). Terms of the deal allow Mantra to pay a special dividend of up to 23.5 Australian cents prior to completion, which would reduce the headline price of A$3.96 a share. Still, some analysts have questioned whether competition regulators will object to a deal that brings together the industry's largest and second-largest hotels groups when measured by number of rooms. Others have suggested a rival could try to gatecrash a deal. Accor runs thousands of properties in 95 countries, and already operates about 200 hotels in Australia that offer more than 27,000 rooms under its Ibis, Novotel, Mercure and other brands. At the end of 2015, the French company agreed to buy FRHI Holdings Ltd., the Toronto-based parent of Fairmont, Raffles and Swissotel brands, for more than US$3 billion. Mantra's portfolio includes more than 20,000 rooms ranging from luxury retreats and coastal resorts to inner-city serviced apartments, run under the namesake Mantra, Peppers and BreakFree banners. Australia, where the company has the bulk of its properties, has notched up 26 years of uninterrupted economic growth while also benefiting from an influx of tourists from countries including China. In a research report in August, Deutsche Bank forecast a significant earnings lift for Mantra next year with the Commonwealth Games on the eastern Gold Coast, where the company has about one-third of its total resorts rooms and other properties. The company has supported earnings growth in recent years with a string of acquisitions, including a A$52.5 million deal entered in August to pick up the Arts Series Hotel Group, a portfolio of seven 4- and 5-star hotels in major Australian cities that were inspired by Australian artists. Mantra established itself in Hawaii in early 2016 with a US$52.5 million deal for Ala Moana, a condominium hotel business in Honolulu.

AC,"MELBOURNE, Australia--French hotels giant Accor SA (AC.FR) has made a more-than-US$900 million bid for Mantra Group Ltd. (MTR.AU) in a deal that would bring together two of the largest lodging providers in Australia. The proposed takeover builds on the merger activity in the industry in recent years as hotel companies have sought increased scale to fend off aggressive home-rental companies and online travel agents. Mantra has more than 125 properties across Australia and New Zealand and a growing footprint in Indonesia and Hawaii. In a regulatory filing Monday, Mantra said it had opened its books to Accor after receiving an indicative takeover offer of about 1.18 billion Australian dollars (US$916.6 million). Discussions with Accor are incomplete and there is no certainty the nonbinding proposal will lead to a takeover agreement, Mantra said. The A$3.96-a-share cash offer remains subject to a number of conditions, including the approval of both companies' boards, it said. The offer represents a 23% premium to Mantra's Friday closing price, and sparked a rally in the shares. Before Mantra's announcement of the offer, the stock had climbed about 80% since it was listed in mid-2014 by CVC Asia Pacific and UBS Group AG (UBS), although it peaked above A$5 at the end of 2015. Accor runs thousands of properties in 95 countries, and already operates about 200 hotels in Australia that offer more than 27,000 rooms under its Ibis, Novotel, Mercure and other brands. At the end of 2015, the French company agreed to buy FRHI Holdings Ltd., the Toronto-based parent of Fairmont, Raffles and Swissotel brands, for more than US$3 billion.

AC,"BRUSSELS--The European Union's antitrust regulator on Friday said it was re-adopting a decision to fine almost a dozen air cargo carriers a total of 776 million euros over colluding to fix prices, after a court overturned the watchdog's previous decision issued in 2010. The European Commission said it was re-lodging its decision against Air Canada, Air France-KLM SA, British Airways, Cargolux Airlines International SA, Cathay Pacific, Japan Airlines Co., LAN Chile, Martinair, Qantas, Scandinavian Airlines System AB and Singapore Airlines for colluding to fix the level of fuel and security surcharges between December 1999 and February 2006. The EU had fined those carriers in November 2010 around 800 million euros ($858 million), but that decision was annulled in December 2015 by the bloc's second-highest court over procedural missteps by the regulator. All the companies except Qantas challenged the EU's decision before the general court ""The commission will not let cartels go unpunished,"" the EU regulator said in a statement.

AC,"WestJet Airlines Ltd. on Tuesday reported a 13% drop in fourth-quarter earnings as rising fuel and maintenance costs outweighed an increase in airline passengers amid the Canadian air carrier's international expansion push. WestJet's profit decline comes as the company expanded its international reach, offering daily flights from six Canadian cities to London's Gatwick airport beginning last May. While the new routes led to a 10% rise in passengers, those additional flights weighed on the company's profit as it incurred additional costs operating its new fleet of Boeing 767-300 jets. WestJet flew 5.4 million passengers in the quarter, a record amount during the period, the company said. Calgary, Alberta-based WestJet posted a fourth-quarter profit of 55.1 million Canadian dollars ($41.7 million), or 47 Canadian cents a share. Results came in below the C$63.4 million, or 51 Canadian cents, it earned a year earlier but ahead the 41 Canadian cents analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected. Revenue rose 6% to C$1.02 billion, in line with analyst expectations. WestJet also maintained its quarterly dividend at 14 Canadian cents a share. A stronger Canadian dollar versus its U.S. counterpart led to rising aircraft fuel costs, the company's biggest operating expense. Fuel costs, which the airline incur in U.S. dollars, were up 15% from a year earlier, while maintenance charges rose 15% as well. WestJet's cost per available seat mile, excluding fuel costs and employee profit-sharing, was 9.87 Canadian cents, a decline of 1.7% from the same quarter last year. ""In 2016 we continued to execute on our profitable growth strategies, which included the further expansion of WestJet Encore and the successful launch of wide-body transatlantic service,"" said Chief Executive Gregg Saretsky.

AC,"PARIS--Accorhotels SA (AC.FR), Europe's largest hotel operator, trimmed its earnings guidance Tuesday as a dip in tourism after terror attacks dragged on revenue in France, the company's home market. The hotel operator said it now expects earnings before interest and tax, or EBIT, between 670 million euros ($736.1 million) and EUR690 million. It previously forecast EBIT between EUR670 million and EUR720 million. ""Given what has happened during the summer we have moved to the lower end of the range,"" AccorHotels chief financial officer Jean-Jacques Morin said. Revenue in France dropped 4.7% in the third quarter in France on a like-for-like basis, which strips out the effects of acquisitions and exchange rate fluctuations. In Paris, the revenue per available room--a key metric for measuring the performance of hotels--fell 17.9%. Still, growth in AccorHotels' other markets helped push overall revenue up 1.8% like-for-like to EUR1.54 billion, outpacing analysts' expectations of a 0.7% rise. Revenue in the Americas was boosted by the Olympic games and U.K. revenues grew due to a weaker pound, which encouraged tourism from abroad and led British people to prefer to take vacation at home, AccorHotels said.

AC,"Major U.S. airlines are carving up cattle class, hoping to nab every customer from the tightwad to the spendthrift amid intensifying competition from discount carriers and declining ticket revenues. Delta Air Lines Inc. is ahead among U.S. carriers in adopting this ""segmentation"" strategy. The carrier started experimenting about three years ago and has since rolled it out in a big way, which for the Atlanta-based airline means splitting its coach fares into three categories: Basic Economy, Main Cabin and Delta Comfort+. The No. 2 U.S. airline by traffic is trying to compete with budget rivals and wring more out of recent product upgrades by selling them to fliers willing to pay more rather than giving them away free to elite frequent fliers. American Airlines Group Inc. and United Continental Holdings Inc. said they would introduce tiered offerings later this year. Some European carriers already have embraced the strategy; Air Canada was a pioneer. ""Finally, airlines are putting some thought into retailing,"" said Peter Belobaba, principal research scientist at the International Center for Air Transportation at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""You can be upfront with consumers and show them different options with different prices and characteristics."" Divvying up coach is a big strategic shift, driven in part by a need to counter discount carriers that make up a third of the U.S. market. Airlines also are eager to raise ticket revenue that has been falling for years as budget airlines have grown. For the past two years, fares have tanked and most airlines have posted declining unit revenues -- the important metric that measures how much they earn for each seat flown a mile. American has said it hopes segmentation would bring in $1 billion in additional revenue annually. United already sells bundled amenities after tickets are purchased including checked bags and roomier seats. Scott Wilson, United's vice president of e-commerce and merchandising, said the airline is eager to expand into full multitiered fare offerings. Until recently, he said ""there hasn't been the opportunity to market good, better and best."" While large airlines spend a lot of money and energy luring lucrative business customers, they are a minority of travelers. American, the largest U.S. airline by traffic, estimates that 87% of its customers are bargain-sensitive travelers who fly once a year or less, yet generate half of its U.S.'s revenue. For decades, airlines concocted elaborate fare rules to separate leisure travelers scrounging for low fares from business travelers willing to pay much more on short notice. The former group was required to book well in advance and spend a Saturday night at their destination, while business-class customers enjoyed ticket refundability and didn't have the weekend-stay rule. In many instances, however, a customer who paid $200 ended up sitting next to a flier who paid $800 without any distinction in boarding process, seat or in-flight service. ""It created a tremendous amount of abrasion between the passenger and the airline,"" said Jay Sorensen, president of airline-loyalty consultant IdeaWorks Co. Discount airlines don't follow those old pricing rules. They sell one-way tickets and offer lower fares than the major carriers even at the last minute. Matching them outright can dilute a major carrier's revenue. Delta says the new pricing model is more competitive with discount carriers, while giving customers more choice. The cheapest fares in Basic Economy often are priced close to those from ultra-discounters Spirit Airlines Inc. and Frontier Airlines Inc. without including fees for advance printed boarding passes, overhead bin space and any type of beverage. Delta's basic fare comes with its own restrictions: passengers can't make flight changes or stand by for a different flight. And the fare only allows fliers to get a seat assignment after check-in, and precludes upgrades or priority boarding, even for frequent fliers. Comfort+, Delta's premier coach class, offers the opposite experience: advanced-seat assignment, early boarding, larger seats and free alcoholic beverages. Ticket changes are allowed at the standard $200 fee. Delta said earlier this month that the ""branded fares"" initiative is in line to generate $1.5 billion in incremental revenue by 2018. Comfort+ is alone expected to generate $300 million in incremental revenue in the second half of this year, and potentially more as the program expands to international routes by the end of 2017. A recent search on Delta's website for a round-trip flight from Atlanta to Fort Lauderdale, Fla., late this month generated a Basic Economy fare of $149. Main Cabin was $179 and Comfort+ went for $214. First class was $406. About half of the travelers who view Basic Economy fares end up upgrading, bolstering the carrier's revenue, Delta said. This is made possible by Delta showing both Basic Economy and Main Cabin choices on its booking engine, after a customer is warned of the restrictions on the former. Some fliers are concerned that the plethora of new categories would make pricing too opaque. But Greg Bradley, a behavioral economist at the University of Southern Mississippi thinks the rules are clear. Delta ""has opened up air travel to a segment that wouldn't have traveled as much,"" he said. In his own travels, though, Mr. Bradley said he eschews the lowest fare category but has upgraded to Comfort+ even on short flights, to lock in early boarding, a seat in the front of the coach cabin and room for his bag in the overhead bin.

AC,"Bombardier Inc. posted a net loss and a nearly 7% drop in second-quarter revenue Friday, hurt in part by lower revenue from its business-jet operations. Still, the Canadian transportation company's top line came in ahead of analyst expectations, and the company backed its full-year guidance after a quarter that saw the launch of its long-awaited new CSeries jet. Montreal-based Bombardier reported a loss of $490 million, or 24 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a profit of $125 million, or 6 cents a share, a year earlier. Adjusted to exclude one-time items, the company recorded a loss of 6 cents a share; analysts polled by Thomson Reuters forecast a loss of 5 cents a share. Revenue of $4.31 billion was down from $4.62 billion a year earlier but better than the $4.17 billion analysts expected. Bombardier's business-jet operations have been stung by political and economic instability in some of its markets, such as China and Latin America, and last year, it scaled back production of its biggest and most lucrative business jets. Business-aircraft deliveries in the latest quarter fell to 42 from 47, contributing to a 19% drop in revenue for the division. Last quarter, Bombardier also reported a loss and declining revenue, but the disappointing results were overshadowed by news of a landmark CSeries order for up to 125 planes from Delta Air Lines Inc. Following that, Canadian air carrier Air Canada completed a deal for up to 75 jets, including 45 firm orders. ""This was a pivotal quarter for the CSeries,"" Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said in a release, noting that the program has started generating revenue. In late June, Bombardier delivered its first CSeries jet to launch operator Swiss International Air Lines, which made its maiden flight with passengers July 15. Bombardier backed its full-year guidance for revenue of $16.5 billion to $17.5 billion and free cash flow usage of $1 billion to $1.3 billion. Free cash flow usage in the latest quarter totaled $490 million.

AC,"PARIS--A cascade of terrorist attacks in Europe is driving away tourists at the height of the summer rush, casting a pall over hotel chains, airline companies and luxury retailers that are already grappling with Britain's vote to leave the European Union. Declines in airline and hotel bookings have spread into European cities and countries that hadn't suffered recent attacks, analysts and companies say. That raises the specter that the violence--combined with a sluggish economy--could have a broader economic impact, affecting companies like Air France-KLM, AccorHotels SA and InterContinental Hotel Group PLC when they report earnings in the next two weeks. ""Europe is not going to be doing them any favors,"" said C. Patrick Scholes, a managing director at SunTrust Robinson Humphrey Inc. ""It's all about fear."" A confluence of negative factors is buffeting Europe's tourism business. Travelers appear more cautious following a spate of attacks-- most recently in Munich and in Nice, France. Economic growth in many European countries is weak, straining some consumers' pocketbooks. And the British pound is down 8.6% against the euro since the Brexit vote--boosting costs for the bloc's single largest source of international tourists after Germany. ""Europe has several, almost I guess, three strikes against it looking forward,"" Scott Kirby, president of American Airlines Group Inc., told analysts on Friday, adding that Europe was the only region where he expects to see sequential declines in the third quarter. Those pressures have driven down stock prices of several Europe-focused tourism firms that report earnings in the next week. Shares in British travel agency Thomas Cook Group PLC, which reports fiscal third-quarter results on Thursday, have plunged 52% since the beginning of the year. Ryanair Holdings PLC, which reports fiscal first-quarter results on Monday, is down 23%. Shares in British Airways parent International Consolidated Airlines Group SA, which reports first-half results on Friday, have fallen 34%. Early data on hotel occupancy rates following the Bastille Day attack in Nice, which killed 84 people, shows the impact stretched well beyond the French Riviera. While occupancy at Paris hotels was already depressed, and it fell precipitously in Nice, preliminary data showed occupancy in London and Amsterdam dropped 2.7% and 8.3%, respectively, compared with a year earlier, by the Sunday after the attack. Airline bookings appear to have declined, too. German airline Deutsche Lufthansa AG issued a profit warning on Wednesday, stating revenue in the second half of the year would fall between 8% and 9% because economic uncertainty and ""repeated terrorist attacks in Europe"" had driven down bookings of long-haul flights to Europe. On Thursday, EasyJet PLC said terrorism threats and the May crash of an Egyptair jet were among factors that reduced demand for the summer months. ""These events, which are tragic and very, very significant, each take a small but noticeable bite out of demand,"" said David Katz, a managing director at Telsey Advisory Group. Luxury retail, which typically sees revenue from international tourists visiting Paris, is hurting as well. Hermès International SCA reported a sharp slowdown in first-half sales growth on Thursday, citing terrorist attacks in Europe and currency fluctuations as primary causes of the downturn. ""We do not see any improvement in tourist traffic in France,"" Chief Executive Axel Dumas said Thursday. ""We will not see one while we are in a state of emergency which prevents customers from coming."" Luxury giant LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE reports first-half earnings on Tuesday. Kering SA reports on Thursday. European travel businesses had already been girding for a difficult tourist season. Despite the promise of the quadrennial European soccer championships, Europe was the only region of the world to receive fewer international bookings for the summer as of May 31, with a decline of 2.1% from last summer, according to ForwardKeys, a data provider that compiles flight-ticket information. While those figures showed the number of international bookings for Spain and Ireland rising in the summer period, those increases were more than offset by an 11% decline in bookings to France, 23% decline to Belgium, and 31% decline to Turkey, ForwardKeys said. Other regions of the world are benefiting from the downturn in Europe, which could soften the blow for some firms. The number of international bookings for destinations this summer in the Asia-Pacific region, which includes China and Australia, rose 7.8% from a year earlier, according to ForwardKeys. Charlie Bateson, product and commercial director of the U.K. branch of luxury travel company Abercrombie & Kent, is also seeing a ""big increase"" in travel to India, China, Japan and South Africa. ""I think we'll see, certainly from where we're sitting, an increase in demand for the more unusual, the more experiential,"" he said.

AC,"PARIS--French hotels company Accor SA (AC.FR) said Tuesday it has bought luxury home rental group onefinestay for 148 million euros ($168.45 million). Accor said it will expand onefinestay in 40 new cities in the next five years, beyond the 2,600 properties currently managed by the serviced home operator, mainly in the key markets of London, New York, Paris, Los Angeles and Rome. To help that expansion, Accor said it will commit a further EUR64 million in addition to the acquisition price. Accor, which operates hotel brands including Pullman and Ibis, said it will share its customer base and distribution capacity with onefinestay as it aims to increase the home rental group's revenue tenfold in the next five years. -Write to William Horobin at william.horobin@wsj.com","Apr 5, 2016 2:21 a.m. ET",1,Accor buys luxury home rental group Onefinestay,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/accor-buys-luxury-home-rental-group-onefinestay-2016-04-05-24852158
AC,"General Electric Co. said the value of Chairman and Chief Executive Jeff Immelt's total compensation fell about 11.5% last year to $33 million, and that three board members would leave this year in a ""refreshment."" Two of GE's longest-serving directors, Douglas Warner III and James Cash, aren't seeking re-election to the board after serving 24 and 19 years, respectively. Mr. Warner is the former chairman of J.P. Morgan Chase, and Mr. Cash is an emeritus professor at Harvard Business School. Also retiring from the board after 14 years is Robert Swieringa, dean emeritus of the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University. GE has nominated Sebastien Bazin, 54, CEO of hotel chain Accor SA; Peter Henry, 46, a professor of economics and finance at NYU's Stern School of Business; and Lowell McAdam, 61, CEO of Verizon Communications Inc. The departure of three long-standing directors comes as GE has taken steps to provide greater turnover on its board. In September, the company adopted 15-year term limits for its directors, though those limits were to be phased in over two years for existing directors . Directors may not be renominated after they have turned 75, though the company says there are limited exceptions to that rule. As for Mr. Immelt's compensation, GE noted that when adjusted for certain items, such as a change in pension value, the CEO's pay was valued at $23.4 million, up 14% from 2014. His base salary rose to $3.8 million from $3.75 million.

AC,"PARIS-- AccorHotels SA Thursday said it continues to suffer from the fallout of November's terrorist attacks in Paris even as the French hotels group reported a rise in earnings that reflects recent turnaround efforts and improved revenue in other key regions. Europe's largest hotel operator, which makes around 30% of its sales in France, reported a sharp 6.6% drop in fourth-quarter sales in France due to the Nov. 13 terror attacks, leading to a 0.5% drop for the year. That came despite tens of thousands of delegates coming to Paris for an environmental conference in December, the company said. ""We're set for a better January but it remains a gradual improvement,"" said Chief Financial Officer Jean-Jacques Morin said on a call with reporters. Mr. Morin said the company's sales in Paris plunged 14% in November and 17% in December as tourists canceled reservations and conferences were rescheduled or downsized. In France more widely, Mr. Morin said sales dropped 4% in November and 7% in December. ""The effect was greatest on the luxury sector,"" Mr. Morin said. ""People decided not to come to Paris but to go to other capital cities."" The Paris terrorist attacks dealt a blow to France's tourist industry and slowed its economy. Sales at Paris hotels dropped by half in the week after Nov. 13 as tourists canceled bookings for the Christmas period and beyond. Although new bookings are returning to normal, companies like AccorHotels are still suffering from the spate of cancellations immediately after the attacks, analysts say. Mr. Morin added that the first quarter this year would also impacted but that reservations were ""good or even very good"" after that, notably due to the European soccer championships in France starting in June. Still, the company said Thursday its turnaround efforts paid dividends in 2015 as it reported a 9.4% jump in net profit to 244 million euros ($271.6 million), up from EUR223 million the year before. The owner of the Ibis and Sofitel chains is in the midst of a turnaround plan led by Chief Executive Sebastien Bazin, a private equity specialist. Mr. Bazin has expanded the group's business in China, increased its exposure to the luxury sector and pursued acquisitions to ramp up its digital know-how. Accor in December agreed to acquire the owner of the Fairmont, Raffles and Swissotel hotel in a deal that values the Toronto-based company, FRHI Holdings Ltd., at about $3 billion, increasing its exposure to the U.S. and the upmarket sector. Full-year earnings before interest and taxes rose 11% to EUR665 million as an increase in sales in most of the group's key regions outweighed falling revenue in France and Brazil. Full-year sales rose 2.3% to EUR5.58 billion, slightly missing analysts' expectations of EUR5.65 billion. Accor declined to provide any specific financial goals for 2016.","Feb 18, 2016 4:23 a.m. ET",1,AccorHotels profit rises despite Paris attacks,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/accorhotels-profit-rises-despite-paris-attacks-2016-02-18
AC,"Bombardier Inc. on Wednesday posted weaker-than-expected fourth-quarter results and guidance and said it plans to cut around 7,000 jobs over the next two years in another blow to the plane maker, which has been hampered by the ramp-up of its struggling CSeries jet program. The Canadian company, which has been slow to win orders for its new CSeries jets and has taken a number of measures in recent months to shore up its finances, said the jobs cuts will hit workers in Canada and Europe and will affect both its plane and train operations. Bombardier said the job cuts, which will lead to restructuring charges of between $250 million and $300 million, will be offset partially by hiring in other areas, including to support its CSeries programs. It didn't provide specific hiring numbers. ""Bombardier is in a better place today, and we are on the path to greater profitability. We are engaged in a rigorous process that will increase our earnings power and cash flow generation over the next five years,"" Chief Executive Alain Bellemare said in a release. The company, which hasn't announced a new CSeries order since September 2014, on Wednesday said it received an order for up to 75 of its larger CSeries 300 model jets from Canadian airline Air Canada. It is the first North American carrier customer for the CSeries, Bombardier said, and the deal consists of an order for 45 of the aircraft plus options for another 30. Based on list prices, a firm order would be valued at about $3.8 billion, Bombardier said. Bombardier also unveiled a plan to help bolster its sagging share price, something analysts were expecting the company to address. It said it would present shareholders with a proposal at its annual meeting later this year to consolidate its shares at an undetermined ratio in a bid to bring its share price up to a range of between 10 Canadian dollars ($7.20) and C$20 each. Shares have been trading below C$1 a share since late January. Bombardier ended the fourth quarter with a loss of $677 million, or 31 cents a share, compared with a year-earlier loss of $1.59 billion, or 92 cents. Adjusted to exclude items, the company earned $9 million, or breakeaven on a per-share basis. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected a profit of 2 cents a share. Revenue fell 16% to $5.02 billion, below the $5.48 billion analysts expected. For 2016, Bombardier said it expects revenue of between $16.5 billion and $17.5 billion, which falls shy of the $18.1 billion analysts expect.

AC,"Canadian air carrier WestJet Airlines Ltd. on Tuesday reported a 30% drop in fourth-quarter earnings, hurt by weakness in the province of Alberta, the heart of Canada's energy patch. A continued slump in crude prices is creating economic headwinds in Canada's oil-producing regions, where producers have been scaling back spending and cutting staff, which is weighing on airline demand. Calgary, Alberta-based WestJet posted a fourth-quarter profit of 63.4 million Canadian dollars ($45.5 million), or 51 Canadian cents a share, which included a pre-tax foreign-exchange loss of C$10 million. Results came in below the C$90.7 million, or 70 Canadian cents, it earned a year earlier and missed the 63 Canadian cents analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expected. Revenue dipped 3.6% to C$958.7 million. Despite a weaker Canadian dollar versus its U.S. counterpart, results did get a lift from a slight drop in overall operating expenses. Aircraft fuel costs, which the airline incurs in U.S. dollars, were down 25% from a year earlier, helped by lower oil prices. WestJet, which maintained its quarterly dividend at 14 Canadian cents a share, increased the top end of its share buyback program to 6 million shares from 4 million. ""Notwithstanding the impact that recent economic weakness in Alberta has had on our results, our decision to increase our normal course issuer bid demonstrates our confidence in WestJet's proven business model and the financial strength of our airline,"" said Chief Executive Gregg Saretsky. Air Canada, WestJet rival and the country's biggest airline, is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter results on Feb. 17.

AC,"BRUSSELS--The European Union's second-highest court has overturned a decision to impose EUR790 million ($864 million) of fines on more than a dozen airlines including Air France KLM and British Airways for operating an airfreight cartel. The Luxembourg-based General Court of the EU said the European Commission's 2010 decision was contradictory because it accused all the carriers of operating a single cartel, but only highlighted actual legal infringements by some carriers on some routes. The court's decision can be appealed at the European Court of Justice, the EU's highest court, on ""points of law only,"" the General Court said in a statement. If the ruling is confirmed, or goes uncontested, Air France KLM and British Airways could each avoid more than EUR100 million of antitrust fines. The other airlines allegedly involved in the cartel are Air Canada, Société Air France, Koninklijke Luchtvaart Maatschappij, Cargolux Airlines International, Cathay Pacific Airways, Japan Airlines Corp., Latam Airlines Group, Deutsche Lufthansa, Martinair Holland, Qantas Airways, SAS and Singapore Airlines.

AC,"French lodging giant Accor SA has agreed to acquire the owner of the Fairmont, Raffles and Swissotel hotel brands, the latest sign that the big hotel operators view getting even bigger as critical to their success. The cash-and-stock deal values the Toronto-based company, FRHI Holdings Ltd., at about $3 billion, making it the third largest lodging acquisition in a year marked by a burst of merger activity, according to data tracker Dealogic. For Accor, which has about 500,000 hotel rooms worldwide and 10 international brands, the deal makes it a bigger player in the luxury hotel segment, where it is known primarily for its Sofitel brand. With 42 properties in North America, FRHI would also give the Paris-based hotel operator a presence in the U.S. that it has lacked since it sold the Motel 6 brand in 2012. FRHI's owners, the Qatar Investment Authority and Kingdom Holding Company of Saudi Arabia, will receive $840 million in cash and 46.7 million in new Accor shares. Under the terms of the deal, which is expected to close in mid-2016, Qatar will own 10.5% of Accor, and Saudi Prince al-Waleed bin Talal's Kingdom Holdings will own 5.8%, according to Accor. Accor's deal comes less than month after Marriott International Inc. agreed to acquire Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. for $12.2 billion in a transaction that would create the world's largest hotel company with more than 1 million rooms and 30 brands. Analysts say major hotel operators are feeling pressure to get bigger so they can compete on a global basis, and more deals are expected as the hotel growth cycle levels off. Fast-growing home-rental companies such as Airbnb are compelling traditional hotel operators to expand or risk losing market share to these burgeoning competitors. Larger hotel companies also can negotiate better fees with online travel agents, including Expedia Inc. and Priceline Group Inc.'s Booking.com. ""It is absolutely true that scale matters today,"" Accor Chief executive Officer Sebastien Bazin said in an interview Wednesday. He added that the deal would diversify its revenue stream, making the company less dependent on its midscale and economy brands. Accor gets about 20% of its hotel management revenue from luxury and other high-end hotels, but the FRHI deal would bring that figure up to 35%, Mr. Bazin said. FRHI owns the three luxury brands, which have about 115 hotels and resorts with 43,000 rooms. FRHI has another 40 hotels and 13,000 rooms under development. The company also manages famous luxury properties around the world, like the Plaza Hotel in New York City and the Savoy in London. Mr. Bazin said the acquisition would increase Accor's market capitalization by about $2 billion with the new share issuance. Accor said it has identified $70 million in revenue and costs synergies in the medium term from the deal. Sarmad Zok, CEO of Kingdom Hotel Investments, said Kingdom thought it was the right time to sell because FRHI brands would be more valuable as part of the Accor family than as a stand-alone company. ""It is really all about that, scale and ability to leverage brands to create greater value,"" he said in an interview.

AC,"NEW YORK, Feb 21, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- RegAResearch, the only media platform dedicated exclusively to news and analysis of Regulation A+ (“Reg A+”) companies, today announced the publication of two company-specific reports identifying a thriving luxury theater-and-restaurant operator along with a high-risk startup focused on the cryptocurrency industry. The reports are available now at RegAResearch.com. The first report investigates iPic Entertainment (ticker:IPIC) and finds the stock offers investors a differentiated growth story at a deeply-discounted price. iPic has pioneered the luxury theater-and-restaurant business, with real-estate developers eager to offer up prime locations as it expands. The company makes most of its revenue from food and beverage, leading to the potential for much-higher margins than theater peers like AMC Entertainment (ticker:AMC) or Cinemark (ticker:CNK). It also derives a large percentage of sales from members of its loyalty program, a strategy that has helped drive growth for Starbucks (ticker:SBUX) and other leading consumer companies. There’s more to come: iPic investors should look out for new partnership announcements in addition to its current deal with Netflix (ticker:NFLX) and the possibility of expansion deals overseas. The second report pinpoints the flaws in the business model of Bitzumi, which has filed for a Reg A+ IPO of up to $10 million that would value the company at $288 million, despite being less than a year old and having no revenue. The company, co-founded by self-proclaimed Bitcoin genius James Altucher, says it plans to launch a cryptocurrency exchange. Its listing would follow the recent success of fintech company Longfin (LFIN), whose shares have risen sixfold since its Reg A+ IPO in December amid demand for cryptocurrency plays. But a deep dive into Bitzumi’s plans show that it may pour as much as 40% of its IPO proceeds on marketing and advertising, leaving the complex undertaking of launching an exchange as a second priority. Investors are better off avoiding this crypto-gamble. About RegAResearch RegAResearch is the first and only media platform dedicated exclusively to news and analysis of Reg A+ companies. We are committed to objective journalism as a means to deliver the clearest and most accurate picture of the microcap industry. In an era when misinformation is rampant, we aspire to distinguish between truth and falsehood, along with opportunity and risk. In particular, we aim to identify Reg A+ companies that are supported by robust business models. We will also endeavor to inform investors about companies that they should beware.

AC,"RYE, N.Y., Jan 26, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Associated Capital Group, Inc. (“AC” or the “Company”) announced today its estimated financial results for the fourth quarter and year ended December 31, 2017. Diluted EPS for the fourth quarter is expected to be within the range of $0.65 to $0.75 compared to $0.15 for the fourth quarter of 2016. Full year EPS is expected to be within the range of $0.35 to $0.45 compared to $0.41 for 2016. GAAP book value is expected to be within the range of $38.80 to $39.00 per share at December 31, 2017, up from $36.04 at December 31, 2016. Adjusted economic book value per share (see below) at December 31, 2017 is expected to be within the range of $40.90 to $41.10. Assets under management at December 31, 2017 increased +21% year-over-year to $1.5 billion. The fourth quarter 2017 estimated results include an income tax benefit related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. This benefit, which is based on reasonable estimates, may require adjustment due to receipt of additional information from investment funds, changes in the Company’s assumptions, and the availability of further guidance and interpretations. We expect to issue additional information regarding our financial results in early February. About Associated Capital Group, Inc. The Company was spun-off from GAMCO Investors, Inc. (“GAMCO”) on November 30, 2015. The Company operates its investment management business via Gabelli & Company Investment Advisers, Inc. (“GCIA” f/k/a Gabelli Securities, Inc.), its 100% owned subsidiary. GCIA and its wholly-owned subsidiary, Gabelli & Partners, collectively serve as general partners or investment managers to investment funds including limited partnerships, offshore companies and separate accounts. The Company primarily manages assets in equity event-driven strategies, across a range of risk and event arbitrage portfolios and earns management and incentive fees from its advisory activities. Management fees are largely based on a percentage of assets under management. Incentive fees are based on a percentage of the investment returns of certain clients’ portfolios. GCIA is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an investment advisor under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended. The Company operates its institutional research services business through G.research (which does business as Gabelli & Company), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. G.research is a broker-dealer registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, that provides institutional research services and acts as an underwriter. The Company also derives investment income/(loss) from proprietary trading of assets awaiting deployment in its operating businesses. NOTES ON NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES Adjusted Economic Book Value Management believes the analysis of adjusted economic book value (“AEBV”) and AEBV per share, both non-GAAP financial measures, are useful in analyzing the Company’s financial condition during the period in which it builds its core operating business. For GAAP purposes, the outstanding principal amount of a note issued by GAMCO, which was issued to the Company as part of its spin-off from GAMCO (the “GAMCO Note”), is treated as a reduction of equity. As GAMCO makes principal payments, the Company’s total equity will increase. Once the GAMCO Note is fully repaid, the Company’s total equity and AEBV will be the same. AEBV and AEBV per share represent book value and book value per share, respectively, increased by the principal balance of the GAMCO Note. SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION The financial results set forth in this press release are preliminary. Our disclosure and analysis in this press release, which do not present historical information, contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Forward-looking statements convey our current expectations or forecasts of future events. You can identify these statements because they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. They use words such as “anticipate,” “estimate,” “expect,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” and other words and terms of similar meaning. They also appear in any discussion of future operating or financial performance. In particular, these include statements relating to future actions, future performance of our products, expenses, the outcome of any legal proceedings, and financial results. Although we believe that we are basing our expectations and beliefs on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of what we currently know about our business and operations, the economy and other conditions, there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ materially from what we expect or believe. Therefore, you should proceed with caution in relying on any of these forward-looking statements. They are neither statements of historical fact nor guarantees or assurances of future performance. Forward-looking statements involve a number of known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other important factors, some of which are listed below, that are difficult to predict and could cause actual results and outcomes to differ materially from any future results or outcomes expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. Some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations or beliefs include a decline in the securities markets that adversely affect our assets under management, negative performance of our products, the failure to perform as required under our investment management agreements, and a general downturn in the economy that negatively impacts our operations. We also direct your attention to the more specific discussions of these and other risks, uncertainties and other important factors contained in our Form 10 and other public filings. Other factors that could cause our actual results to differ may emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for us to predict all of them. We do not undertake to update publicly any forward-looking statements if we subsequently learn that we are unlikely to achieve our expectations whether as a result of new information, future developments or otherwise, except as may be required by law.

AC,"NEW YORK, Jan 23, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- The law firm of Kirby McInerney LLP announced today that a class action lawsuit has been filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against AMC Entertainment, Inc. (“AMC” or the “Company”) AMC, +4.07% on behalf of investors that acquired AMC securities in the February 8, 2017 Secondary Public Offering (“SPO”) or during the period from December 20, 2016 through August 1, 2017 (the “Class Period”), seeking recovery of damages for alleged violations of the federal securities laws. Pursuant to applicable law, investors have until March 13, 2018 to apply to the Court to be appointed as lead plaintiff in the lawsuit. On November 30, 2016, AMC acquired Odeon and UCI Cinemas Holdings, and on December 21, 2016, AMC acquired Carmike Cinemas. Also on December 21, 2016, AMC filed a shelf Registration Statement with the SEC to permit the Company to offer and sell AMC common shares. The Complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period, Defendants failed to disclose that Carmike’s operations had been performing poorly. On August 1, 2017, post-market, AMC announced worse-than-expected preliminary second quarter 2017 financial results due to a loss of market share that occurred during 2016 and the poor performance of acquired Carmike theaters. On this news, AMC stock fell from $20.80 to close at $15.20 on August 2, 2017 (a decline of $5.60), or more than 50% below the price at which the shares were sold in the SPO.

AC,"LEAWOOD, Kan., Dec 11, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. AMC, +4.07% (“AMC” or “the Company”), the largest cinema operator in the U.S., Europe and the world, today announced the signing of a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with The Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF). In line with the Fund’s mandate to help unlock promising new sectors within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, PIF and AMC Entertainment will explore a range of commercial opportunities for collaboration that will support the growth of the Kingdom’s entertainment sector. The agreement builds on the announcement of the General Commission for Audiovisual Media’s (GCAM) decision to grant domestic licenses to cinema providers, and directly supports the Vision 2030 objective of growing household spending on entertainment from 2.9% to 6.0% of GDP. A spokesperson from PIF said: “PIF sees huge potential in the Kingdom’s entertainment sector. We look forward to working with AMC Entertainment Holdings to explore opportunities in developing an industry that is expected to be around USD 1Bn in size.” “This announcement is an historic moment for the theatrical exhibition industry and a tremendous opportunity to connect AMC’s movie products with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s more than 30 million citizens, many of whom we know are movie fans based on their regular visits to cinemas in neighboring countries,” said AMC CEO and President, Adam Aron. “Saudi Arabia represents a lucrative business opportunity for AMC Entertainment, and no one does the cinema experience on a global scale better than AMC. As such we believe AMC is in a unique position to put the industry’s best foot forward in expanding the magic of the movies to an important country that is in the process of opening up entertainment opportunities for its citizens.” About the Public Investment Fund: In March 2015, the Council of Ministers issued a decree to transfer oversight of the Public Investment Fund to the Council of Economic and Development Affairs (CEDA). As part of this process, a new Board was appointed, chaired by His Royal Highness the Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman Al-Saud. To help achieve Saudi Arabia’s vision of a sustainable, diversified economy, the Board of Directors has taken several steps to clearly define the Public Investment Fund’s vision, objectives and strategy in line with Saudi Vision 2030. The Public Investment Fund is developing a portfolio of high quality domestic and international investments, diversified across sectors, geographies and asset classes. Working alongside global strategic partners and renowned investment managers, PIF acts as the Kingdom’s main investment arm to deliver a strategy focused on achieving attractive financial returns and long-term value for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Public Investment Fund aims to be a global investment powerhouse and the world’s most impactful investor, enabling the creation of new sectors and opportunities that will shape the future global economy, while driving the economic transformation of Saudi Arabia.
