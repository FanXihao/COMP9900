ACIU,"Two weeks ago, a scientific approach to developing an Alzheimer’s disease treatment looked dead in the water. Come Friday, it had a faint pulse. Full data from a failed Eli Lilly and Co. LLY, +0.47% clinical trial sent Biogen Inc. BIIB, +0.74%  shares up as much as 5.1% in morning trade, recouping and more the losses of two weeks prior. AC Immune SA ACIU, -0.58% also developing a treatment using the “beta amyloid hypothesis” — which targets protein fragments that some believe are responsible for the disease — saw shares rise as much as 10.8% in morning trade. Eli Lilly’s solanezumab didn’t meet its primary endpoint, which was for patients to show less of a cognitive decline. But secondary endpoints — which showed the drug’s effect on other measures of function and cognition — were statistically significant, leaving “hope in the beta-amyloid hypothesis for remaining candidates,” said Leerink Partners’ Paul Matteis. “Amyloid hypothesis lives to see another day,” proclaimed J.P. Morgan’s Cory Kasimov. A panel of doctors discussing the results of the late Thursday presentation differed on how significant the results were for the beta-amyloid hypothesis, with assessments ranging from neutral to positive. The discussion was “quite encouraging (relative to what it could’ve been),” Matteis said. Most of the “limitations and liabilities” of Eli Lilly’s drug and late-stage trial “point to a materially higher likely effect, and likelihood of development success, for Biogen’s drug,” said Leerink Partners’ Geoffrey Porges, who rates Biogen outperform with a $355 price target, about 17% above the price stock was trading at Friday.

Results, which had been leaked Thursday and ultimately prompted a release by the company, are scheduled for a Friday presentation. The newest results continue the “extremely compelling” evidence for aducanumab’s effect on plaque removal, said Stifel’s Thomas Shrader. “It’s extremely clear Aducanumab both gets into the brain and removes existing plaque. This removal of plaque remains somewhat controversial with respect to disease relevance,” since that mechanism may not actually treat Alzehimer’s, he said. Cognitive and behavioral outcomes of the trial were also positive, he noted. Related: What Eli Lilly’s hard fall in Alzheimer’s treatment race means for its competitors Lilly's Alzheimer's Drug Fails, and More The prognosis of the beta-amyloid hypothesis remains mixed. Despite positive notes in Eli Lilly’s data, “the clinical effect was small in all cases (~7-15%), and a LLY representative on the panel noted that even if the trial had met [statistical significance] on the primary there would have been significant discussion around clinical meaningfulness/whether to move forward,” said Kasimov, who rates Biogen overweight. “Panel docs generally agreed that the drug appeared to be doing something, but the effect size was very small” and may be better for those with very early Alzehimer’s, called protodromal Alzehimer’s. And, ultimately, Eli Lilly’s solanezumab “still failed in a very highly powered study,” Matteis said, reducing the odds of AC Immune SA’s crenezumab — which he rates outperform with a $12.05 price target — by five points to 35%.

The Eli Lilly results may also support the crenezumab drug being developed by Roche RO, +0.20%  and AC Immune SA. Its higher levels of dosing now appear more promising, Matteis said. But Eli Lilly’s solanezumab itself should be wrapped up, said Leerink’s Seamus Fernandez, who called CTAD results “the end of sola’s siren song.” “In our view, the data presented did little to confirm or refute the beta amyloid hypothesis, given the tiny “benefit” in EXPEDITION3 relative to the almost complete absence of real biomarker effects,” Fernandez said. “LLY conducted a superb clinical study though, which gives us confidence that efforts targeting beta amyloid plaques directly (eg. BIIB’s [OP] adacanumab, Roche [NR]’s gantenerumab and crenezumab), or through beta amyloid production (BACE inhibitors from [Merck & Co. MRK, -1.13% ] [MP] and LLY [OP]/[Astra Zeneca AZN, -0.46% ] [OP]) in “early” AD (mild/prodromal) can be credibly viewed as definitive tests of the amyloid hypothesis.” Biogen shares have dropped 2% year-to-date, compared with a 10.2% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38% Eli Lilly shares dropped 19.3% year-to-date.

ACIU,"Eli Lilly and Company shares plunged 11% Wednesday to a two-year low, after the company’s treatment for people with mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease failed to meet the primary endpoint in a late-stage clinical trial. The failure, which several Wall Street analysts said was disappointing, could have negative implications for Eli Lilly’s LLY, +0.47%  Alzheimer’s portfolio and competitors including Biogen Inc.

MRK, -1.13% See also: These simple lifestyle changes can prevent or slow Alzheimer’s More specifics about the solanezumab drug, expected the night of Dec. 9 during a meeting of the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer’s Disease (CTAD), could have repercussions for what’s called the “beta amyloid hypothesis” in Alzheimer’s disease treatments, which target protein fragments that some believe are responsible for the disease. Read also: Is an Alzheimer’s vaccine on the horizon? How Personalized Music Playlists Help Alzheimer’s Patients Eli Lilly said it would not pursue approval for the drug to treat mild dementia due to Alzheimer’s disease and that it will “evaluate the impact of these results on the development plans for solanezumab and our other Alzheimer’s pipeline assets.” The trial failure is expected to result in a fourth-quarter charge of 9 cents per share after tax, the company said. The shares, which suffered the biggest one-day percentage decline in eight years, closed at the lowest level since Nov. 26, 2014. They have dropped 19% year-to-date, while the SPDR Health Care Select Sector exchange-traded fund XLV, +0.76%  has slipped 3.9% and S&P 500 index SPX, +1.38%  has gained 7.9%. Read also: What to know about Alzheimer’s and retirement planning The latest trial results are solanezumab’s third late-stage failure, noted Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez. “Despite moving earlier into the disease progression (mild patients) and using biomarker to select patients (beta amyloid PET imaging), the treatment effect still proved to be not sufficient to result in a significant slowing of cognitive decline,” he said. “This result will no doubt cast a shadow over LLY’s Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) pipeline portfolio, which is heavily based on the beta amyloid hypothesis.” The company’s portfolio of Alzheimer’s research includes “many other promising approaches,” Eli Lilly executive vice president of science and technology Jan Lundberg said. Graphic embed is no longer available. Though investors took the solanezumab results as a negative for Eli Lilly and competitors in the Alzheimer’s space, Wall Street analysts were more positive in the long-term. Within Eli Lilly’s results, some details even have positive hints for the beta amyloid hypothesis, said Evercore ISI’s John Scotti. A p-value for the primary endpoint of cognition was not statistically significant but “does suggest a trend of favor of [solanezumab],” he said. Biogen’s treatment differs from Eli Lilly’s, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael J. Yee, since “it has shown clear [statistically significant] reduction of beta amyloid via imaging, while others have not,” earlier small studies have shown clear statistically significant cognitive benefits and it is a different antibody than Lilly’s treatment. “These are different antibodies with different amyloid targets,” he said, predicting Biogen—which saw shares drop 3.8%—will present positive data at the December CTAD meeting. Eli Lilly’s negative results could even be a boon for Biogen, said Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal, since the results’ “trend toward positivity” — cognitive decline didn’t decline at a statistically significant rate compared to the placebo — “seems to be the best result for Biogen as it suggests that the amyloid beta hypothesis seems correct and yet this eliminates an early competitor.” Shares of Merck, which is also developing a treatment based on amyloid beta reduction, pared earlier losses of as much as 3% to close down just 0.1%.

But Leerink analyst Paul Matteis remained “cautiously optimistic” about the company’s crenezumab, which he said is similar to Biogen’s aducanumab but has higher doses. Matteis reiterated an outperform rating on the shares, though he emphasized the importance of December’s data on the beta amyloid hypothesis.

ACIU,"Dec 01, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Lausanne, Switzerland, December 1, 2017 - AC Immune SA ACIU, -0.58% a Swiss-based, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases, shared the top level insights from today's Key Opinion Leader (KOL) luncheon meeting on the importance of Tau as a target in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. The meeting featured presentations by KOLs Khalid Iqbal, PhD (New York State Institute for Basic Research in Developmental Disabilities) and Michael Rafii, MD, PhD (UC San Diego and USC). Dr. Khalid Igbal highlighted the critical importance of Tau as a therapeutic target in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases and how inhibition and prevention of the Tau pathology can potentially rescue the pathology of Alzheimer's disease and cognitive impairment. Dr. Iqbal commented: ""Neurodegeneration leads to Tau pathology and Tau pathology leads to neurodegeneration. Where there is no Tau pathology, there is no Alzheimer's disease. Tau-based therapeutic approaches have significant potential to treat a range of neurodegenerative diseases."" Dr. Michael Rafii discussed Tau mediated pathology and the importance of Tau diagnostics in people with Down syndrome, a population with a genetic predisposition to develop Alzheimer's related neuropathological changes including Abeta plaques and Tau tangles. Dr. Rafii remarked: ""Biomarkers of Alzheimer's, including Tau-PET, can be readily studied in adults with Down syndrome as in other preclinical AD populations. By understanding the link between Alzheimer's and Down syndrome, we may not only be able to help the Down syndrome community but the broader population as well. People with Down syndrome are an important population to study as we enhance our understanding of early intervention and prevention of Alzheimer's disease in general."" AC Immune's management provided an overview of the Company's strategy to invest and build value in each of the three pillars of its business -- Alzheimer's disease, other significant neurodegenerative diseases and neuro-orphan indications, and diagnostics. Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune, said: ""We are delighted to share the valuable insights of these world-leading experts with our investors and stakeholders. These types of exchanges are vital so we can all work more effectively together to achieve the common goal of an approved disease-modifying therapeutic and earlier diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease - one of society's biggest challenges of the century."" ""AC Immune has a deep pipeline of diagnostics and therapeutics with the clear goal to become the leader in precision medicine in Alzheimer's disease. The goal of precision medicine is to deliver optimally targeted and timed interventions tailored to an individual's molecular drivers of disease."" Dr. Andreas Muhs, CSO of AC Immune, highlighted AC Immune's relevant Tau programs: ACI-35, an anti-Tau vaccine in Phase 1b and developed in collaboration with Janssen Pharmaceuticals under a 2014 licensing agreement RO7105705, an anti-Tau antibody in Phase 2 and developed in collaboration with Genentech under a 2012 licensing agreement Morphomer Tau, a small molecule in pre-clinical development and developed in-house PI-2620, a Tau-PET imaging agent developed in collaboration with Piramal Imaging under a 2014 licensing agreement  A replay of the event is available on the Investor Page of AC Immune's website.

(2) Adjusted Income (Loss) and Adjusted EPS are non-IFRS measures. See ""Non-IFRS Financial Measures"" below for further information. Revenues Revenues fluctuate as a result of the timing of signing new collaboration agreements, the timing of milestone achievements, and the size of each milestone payment. AC Immune generated revenues of CHF 1.0 million in the three months ended September 30, 2017, a decrease of CHF 0.3 million over the comparable period in 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, AC Immune recorded revenues of CHF 3.8 million, a decrease of CHF 18.0 million from CHF 21.8 million in the same period of 2016. For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the decrease in collaboration revenues was principally due to the recognition of two milestones reached in the first nine months of 2016 related to the anti-Tau antibody agreement with Genentech and the anti-Tau vaccine agreement with Janssen. Revenues in the first nine months of 2017 were mainly driven by a EUR 1 million (CHF 1.1 million) milestone from Piramal Imaging for the initiation of the Phase 1 clinical trial in the orphan indication of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), and the recognition of CHF 2.7 million in research contribution revenues related to the alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 PET tracer collaboration with Biogen. Research & Development (R&D) Expenses For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, research and development expenses totaled CHF 8.2 million and CHF 22.5 million, respectively, compared with CHF 7.7 million and CHF 18.7 million for the same periods in 2016. This increase was primarily driven by further investment in the two anti-Abeta ACI-24 vaccine programs in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome, in programs focused on Parkinson's disease such as alpha-synuclein PET imaging, and in discovery programs for neurodegenerative orphan indications. The R&D investment also reflects the addition of new hires brought on board to accelerate the development of proprietary and partnered pipeline candidates. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses General and administrative expenses amounted to CHF 2.5 million and CHF 7.0 million in the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared with CHF 1.7 million and CHF 4.5 million in the same periods in 2016, respectively. The increase is predominantly due to increased operating expenses as the Company was publicly traded for the first nine months of 2017 and not in the comparable 2016 period. IFRS Loss for the period For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017, the Company had a net loss after taxes of CHF 8.8 million and CHF 30.6 million compared with net loss of CHF 9.1 million and CHF 2.3 million for the same periods in 2016. The decline in profitability is attributable to the decreased revenues for the periods as a result of prior milestone achievements and an increase in R&D and G&A expenses as outlined above. Cash position As of September 30, 2017 AC Immune had total cash of CHF 117.2 million compared to CHF 152.2 million as of December 31, 2016. The decrease of CHF 35 million is principally due to the net loss of CHF 30.6 million for the nine month period. Net cash flows used in operating activities were CHF 28.4 million, due to the higher investments in our major discovery and development programs and the strengthening of the Company's infrastructure, systems and organization during our first year as a publicly-traded company. Further details are available in our corresponding Statements of Cash Flows filed with our Form 6-K. Third Quarter 2017 Company Highlights ACI-24 - anti-Abeta vaccine in Phase 1b in individuals with Down syndrome Together with our prestigious partners recruitment was completed for the low-dose cohort in a Phase 1b trial targeting Alzheimer's disease-like characteristics in individuals with Down syndrome. The study evaluates the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the anti-Abeta vaccine ACI-24 and is being funded through a grant from The US National Institute on Ageing and an additional grant from the LuMind Research Down Syndrome Foundation. Interim results are expected in 2018. Pipeline expansion with new antibodies against alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 This discovery marks the advancement of our business strategy by targeting pathological proteins involved in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, beyond Abeta and Tau. These two antibodies might potentially also address significant neurodegenerative and orphan indications. Alpha-Synuclein is an established target for Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body diseases while TDP-43 is a recently identified target of growing interest for neuro-orphan indications such as Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration. Both antibodies were discovered using the Company's proprietary SupraAntigen platform which has already generated four products in clinical development including Crenezumab our lead product candidate that is partnered with Genentech/Roche in Phase 3 for Alzheimer's. Continuation of 2015 Grant from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research In October 2017 the company announced it has been awarded a continuation of a February 2015 research grant from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF). This provides funds for the development of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracers for the alpha-synuclein protein, to support the early diagnosis and clinical management of Parkinson's disease. AC Immune has been collaborating on this biomarker program with Biogen, since April 2016. AC Immune expects to move the program into clinical development in 2018. Subsequent events: Anti-Tau antibody - Genentech moved into Phase 2 triggering milestone In November 2017, AC Immune became eligible to receive a milestone payment of CHF 14 million upon the dosing of the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease (AD) the anti-Tau monoclonal antibody RO7105705 under a collaboration agreement with Genentech. This is the third milestone payment under the 2012 strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with Genentech for anti-Tau antibodies for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases and is expected to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2017. Non-IFRS Financial Measures In addition to our operating results, as calculated in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, or IFRS, as adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board, we use Adjusted Income (Loss) and Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per share when monitoring and evaluating our operational performance. Adjusted Income (Loss) is defined as income (loss) for the relevant period, as adjusted for certain items that we believe are not indicative of our ongoing operating performance. Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per share is defined as Adjusted Income (Loss) for the relevant period divided by the weighted-average number of shares for such period. We believe that these measures assist our shareholders because they enhance comparability of our results each period and provide more useful insight into operational results for the period. The Company's executive management uses these non-IFRS measures to evaluate our operational performance. These non-IFRS financial measures are not meant to be considered alone or substitute for our IFRS financial measures and should be read in conjunction with AC Immune's financial statements prepared in accordance with IFRS. The most directly comparable IFRS measure to these non-IFRS measures is net income (loss). The following table reconciles net income (loss) to Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) and Adjusted Net Earnings (Loss) per share for the periods presented: Reconciliation of Income/(Loss) to Adjusted Income/(Loss) and Earnings/(Loss) Per Share to Adjusted Earnings/(Loss) Per Share   For the three months ended September 30,   For the nine months ended September 30,   2017 2016 2017 2016 in CHF thousands except for share and per share data   Income/(Loss) (8,793) (9,102) (30,575) (2,329) Adjustments:         Non-cash share-based payments (a) 570 200    824    350 Foreign currency (gains)/losses (b) (800) 932   4,843   727 Adjusted Income/(loss) (9,023) (7,970) (24,908) (1,252)    Earnings/(Loss) per share - basic and diluted (0.15) (0.18) (0.54) (0.05) Adjustment to earnings/(loss) per share - basic and diluted (0.01) 0.02 0.10 0.02 Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per share - basic and diluted (0.16) (0.16)     (0.44)     (0.03) Weighted-average number of shares used to compute Adjusted Earnings (Loss) per share - basic and diluted 57,164,145 49,453,058           57,023,032           47,993,347 Reflects non-cash expenses associated with share-based compensation for equity awards issued to Directors, Management and employees of the Company. This expense reflects the awards' fair value recognized for the portion of the equity award which is vesting over the period. Reflects foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses for the period, predominantly impacted by the change in the exchange rate between the US Dollar and the Swiss Franc. Non-IFRS Expenditures Adjustments for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2017 were CHF 0.2 million in net gains and CHF 5.7 million in net losses, respectively. These were largely due to foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses of CHF 0.8 million and CHF 4.8 million, respectively, predominantly related to the cash balance of the Company as a result of a weakening of the US Dollar against the Swiss Franc for most of the first half of the year offset by gains in the third quarter. The Company also recorded CHF 0.6 million and CHF 0.8 million for the three and nine months, respectively, for share-based compensation expenses.

ACIU,"Nov 02, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- AC Immune to receive third milestone payment of CHF 14 million under collaboration agreement with Genentech Phase 2 to evaluate effects of anti-Tau antibody in people with prodromal-to-mild Alzheimer's disease Phase 1 data to be presented today at CTAD conference, Boston, USA  Lausanne, Switzerland, November 2, 2017 - AC Immune SA ACIU, -0.58% a Swiss-based, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases, today announced that Genentech, a member of the Roche Group, has dosed the first patient in a Phase 2 clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease (AD) with an anti-Tau monoclonal antibody known as RO7105705. This investigational medicine was discovered and humanized as part of the company's collaboration with Genentech. Upon the dosing of the first patient in the Phase 2 clinical trial, AC Immune becomes eligible to receive a milestone payment of CHF 14 million, which is expected to be paid in the fourth quarter of 2017. This will be the third milestone payment under the 2012 strategic collaboration and licensing agreement with Genentech for anti-Tau antibodies for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. AC Immune also has a licensing agreement for the anti-Abeta antibody crenezumab, which is in Phase 3 clinical studies being conducted by Genentech. Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune, commented: ""We are delighted that our collaboration partner Genentech is taking this anti-Tau antibody into Phase 2. Tau pathology is widely recognized to be closely associated with cognitive decline and neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease and other tauopathies."" She continued ""Our unique understanding of the pathology of misfolding proteins is exemplified by the depth of our pipeline and the range of our collaborations."" About the Phase 2 clinical trial The Phase 2 clinical trial is conducted by Genentech and will enroll 360 patients to assess the safety, tolerability and efficacy of the anti-Tau monoclonal antibody RO7105705 in people with prodromal-to-mild AD. Participants will receive one of three active doses or placebo for 72 weeks, followed by a 96-week optional open label extension. Primary endpoints include safety measures and the composite functional and cognitive endpoint CDR (Clinical Dementia Rating scale) sum-of-boxes score. Change from baseline in Tau pathological burden is an important exploratory endpoint. Phase 1 results to be presented at CTAD conference Boston The start of the Phase 2 clinical trial follows the completion of a Phase 1 clinical trial that involved 75 subjects and evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity of RO7105705 in people with mild-to-moderate AD and in healthy volunteers. Preliminary data relating to the single and multiple dose cohorts were presented at the International Conference on Alzheimer's & Parkinson's Disease (AD/PD) in March 2017 (Kerchner et al, Genentech) and the Alzheimer's Association International Conference (AAIC) in July 2017 (Kerchner et al, Genentech). The full analysis of the Phase 1 will be presented by Dr. Kerchner at the Clinical Trials on Alzheimer's Disease (CTAD) conference today, November 2, 2017 (3:00pm EST | 8) in Boston, USA. RO7105705 was administered at single doses of up to 16,800 mg in healthy volunteers and multiple doses of 8,400 mg in healthy volunteers and patients with AD. No dose-limiting toxicities were observed. RO7105705 exhibited a dose proportional pharmacokinetic profile, indicated CNS exposure and showed a median half-life of more than 32 days. Plasma total Tau concentration increased with increasing drug doses and was greater in participants with AD than in healthy volunteers, suggesting a pharmacodynamic signal. About the anti-Tau antibody (RO7105705) RO7105705 is an IgG4 humanized anti-Tau monoclonal antibody in clinical development for the treatment of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. It shows a high specificity for pathological Tau and is designed to intercept the cell-to-cell spread of pathological Tau in the extracellular space of the brain. This investigational medicine was discovered and humanized as part of AC Immune's collaboration with Genentech. About the license agreement In June 2012, AC Immune entered into a strategic collaboration agreement with Genentech to commercialize AC Immune's anti-Tau antibodies for use as immunotherapeutics. The value of this exclusive, worldwide alliance is potentially greater than CHF 400 million and includes upfront and milestone payments. In addition to milestones, AC Immune will be eligible to receive royalties on sales at percentage rates ranging from the mid-single digits to high-single digits. The agreement also provides for collaboration on additional indications developed as part of the same anti-Tau antibody program, as well as a potential anti-Tau diagnostic product. To date, AC Immune has received payments totaling CHF 45 million excluding the CHF 14 million milestone payment which AC Immune became eligible to receive upon commencement of the Phase 2 clinical study. About Tau in Alzheimer's disease and neurodegenerative diseases It is becoming increasingly clear that Alzheimer's disease develops because of a complex series of events that take place in the brain over a long period of time. Two proteins - Tau and amyloid-beta (Abeta) - are recognized as major hallmarks of AD. Pathological forms of Tau aggregate inside neurons to form neurofibrillary tangles, and appear to propagate by cell-to-cell spread between neurons. By contrast, Abeta-containing plaques and oligomers form outside the brain cells of people with AD. Tau protein is mostly present in neurons and functions as a component of the cytoskeleton inside the cells. Misfolded Tau protein aggregates in AD and other Tau-related neurodegenerative diseases (e.g. progressive supranuclear palsy, frontotemporal dementia and others). In AD, accumulation of Tau pathology occurs later than the accumulation of Abeta pathology. The progression of Tau pathology through the brain is closely associated with the onset and progression of cognitive decline, underscoring the importance of Tau-targeted therapies. Please follow this link to learn more about the biology of Alzheimer's disease and the importance of Tau as a target in AD. About Alzheimer's disease AD is one of the biggest burdens of society with a dramatic and growing worldwide incidence rate of one new case every three seconds, or 9.9 million new cases of dementia each year. Since the incidence and prevalence of AD increase with age, the number of patients will grow significantly as society ages. Worldwide in 2015 there were 46.8 million people living with dementia and by 2050 it is expected that global patient numbers will triple to 131.5 million. In the US, AD is now the 6th leading cause of death across all ages and is the fifth leading cause of death for those aged 65 and older. The total US national costs of caring for dementia patients are estimated at USD 259 billion in 2017 and are projected to increase by 400% to USD 1.1 trillion in 2050 in the US alone.

ACIU,"Oct 03, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Continued development of PET tracer for earlier and more accurate diagnosis of Parkinson's disease Focuses on alpha-synuclein, a key protein in Parkinson's disease pathology Lausanne, Switzerland, - October 3, 2017 - AC Immune SA ACIU, -0.58% a Swiss-based, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases, today announced it has been awarded a continuation of a February 2015 research grant from the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research (MJFF). This provides funds for the development of Positron Emission Tomography (PET) tracers for the alpha-synuclein protein, to support the early diagnosis and clinical management of Parkinson's disease. AC Immune has been collaborating on this biomarker program with Biogen, since April 2016. AC Immune expects to move the program into clinical development in 2018. Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune, said: ""We are honored to receive continued funding from The Michael J. Fox Foundation for this important diagnostic program in Parkinson's disease, which we are working on in collaboration with Biogen. The support of MJFF further validates AC Immune's leading expertise in the pathology of misfolded proteins. We continue to leverage our proprietary technology platforms, developing both diagnostic and therapeutic agents for multiple neurodegenerative diseases."" Dr. David Lowe, Principal Investigator for the study and Innovation Fellow of AC Immune said: ""The valuable continued support of the prestigious Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research reinforces our dedication to producing a vital tool for the use of physicians in combatting this debilitating disease. We aim to move this PET tracer program into the clinic in 2018."" ""The development of an alpha-synuclein imaging agent would be transformative for Parkinson's disease patient care and drug development. We are pleased with the progress of the AC Immune program toward this critical goal,"" commented Jamie Eberling, PhD, director of research programs at MJFF. About the R&D program Such alpha-synuclein-PET tracers would help to diagnose Parkinson's disease earlier and more accurately. This technology has multiple advantages including direct detection of alpha-synuclein pathology in patients and the capacity to monitor the efficacy of therapeutics reducing alpha-synuclein aggregates in clinical trials. AC Immune's proprietary Morphomer [TM] chemistry technology platform is designed to interact with misfolded and aggregated proteins. Promising small molecules have been identified with good selectivity for alpha-synuclein and suitable properties for the development as PET ligands. The ability to precisely diagnose Parkinson's disease and other synucleinopathies and therefore treat patients earlier is critical to disease management that uses novel therapeutic approaches. About alpha-synuclein-PET tracers A brain Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test of the brain involving an imaging device and an imaging agent called a PET tracer. No alpha-synuclein-PET tracer has received regulatory approval for commercial distribution, which represents an important medical need, not only in Parkinson's disease but also in other synucleinopathies such as dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. Once the alpha-synuclein-PET tracer is introduced to the body, it transiently enters the brain and binds to abnormal alpha-synuclein protein structures (Lewy bodies). Through the radio-tracer on the tracer molecule, the imaging device detects the bound alpha-synuclein imaging agent and creates pictures reflecting the amount and distribution of pathological alpha-synuclein in the brain. About Parkinson's disease Parkinson's disease is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder after Alzheimer's disease. Parkinson's disease affects approximately 1% of individuals older than 60 years and causes progressive disability (motor and non-motor symptoms). Current therapies only treat the symptoms of Parkinson's; there is no available treatment that can slow or halt disease progression. The two major neuropathological findings in Parkinson's disease are loss of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta and the presence of Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites in which the major constituent is alpha-synuclein. The abnormal accumulations of fibrillar alpha-synuclein in Lewy bodies, and the mutations in the gene for alpha-synuclein in familial forms of Parkinson's disease, have led to the belief that this protein has a central role in Parkinson's disease. The development of alpha-synuclein pathology appears to correlate with the loss of dopaminergic neurons and subsequent decline in motor performance, making it a highly relevant molecular target for diagnostic approaches. About The Michael J. Fox Foundation As the world's largest nonprofit funder of Parkinson's research, The Michael J. Fox Foundation is dedicated to accelerating a cure for Parkinson's disease and improved therapies for those living with the condition today. The Foundation pursues its goals through an aggressively funded, highly targeted research program coupled with active global engagement of scientists, Parkinson's patients, business leaders, clinical trial participants, donors and volunteers. In addition to funding more than $700 million in research to date, the Foundation has fundamentally altered the trajectory of progress toward a cure. Operating at the hub of worldwide Parkinson's research, the Foundation forges groundbreaking collaborations with industry leaders, academic scientists and government research funders; increases the flow of participants into Parkinson's disease clinical trials with its online tool, Fox Trial Finder; promotes Parkinson's awareness through high-profile advocacy, events and outreach; and coordinates the grassroots involvement of thousands of Team Fox members around the world.

ACIU,"NEW YORK, September 12, 2017 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- NEW YORK, September 12, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Known as America's most expensive disease, with an estimated cost to the U.S. economy of $236 billion in 2016, Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects more than 5.3 million Americans. Over the next 20 years, the number of those afflicted with the disease is expected to double. The forecast is staggering, considering that no effective cure has been found, but the quest for one continues, with India Globalization Capital, Inc. IGC, +1.34% (IGC Profile), Anavex Life Sciences AVXL, +0.00% , Axovant Sciences AXON, -1.48% , AC Immune Ltd. ACIU, -0.58% and Biogen, Inc. BIIB, +0.74% all exploring a variety of approaches to uncover the pathological pathways of this chronic neurodegenerative disease. It is believed that Alzheimer's disease is caused by two types of legions in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus: senile plaque composed of the protein beta-amyloid (Aβ plaque), and neurofibrillary tangle, composed of highly phosphorylated Tau protein. The surface of neurons has a protein called APP that is sectioned by enzymes to free up the Aβ protein that is then cleared by the body. In Alzheimer's patients, however, there is an imbalance whereby Aβ protein is not regulated and builds up abnormally into insoluble fibroles, creating senile plaques.   Currently, India Globalization Capital (IGC) is the only publicly traded pharmaceutical cannabis stock that addresses Alzheimer's disease, which positions the company with a first-mover advantage in phytocannabinoid-based combination therapy (http://nnw.fm/0QDQz). The company's drug candidate, IGC-ADI, works through a molecular pathway that allows low doses of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) to 1) inhibit Aβ protein production, 2) inhibit Aβ protein aggregation, 3) reduce protein phosphorylation, 4) potentially restore mitochondria function, and 5) potentially redirect the immune system. IGC's evidence supporting this theory is based on two studies done on tissue and mice at the University of South Florida (USF). The USF study found 1) THC to be effective at lowering Aβ levels in N2a/AβPPswe cells at extremely low concentrations in a dose-dependent manner over a 48-hour period; 2) that THC directly interacts with Aβ protein, thereby inhibiting aggregation; 3) that THC was effective at lowering both total GSK-3β levels and phosphorylated GSK-3β in a dose-dependent manner at low concentrations; and 4) that low doses of THC can increase mitochondria function. These studies led to the filing of a patent by USF entitled, ""THC as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Alzheimer's Disease."" IGC acquired the exclusive right to this patent filing and expects to advance the technology and IGC-AD1 through medical trials. The theory is further supported by a study conducted by researchers at the Salk Institute of Biological Studies, who drew similar conclusions. In June 2016, the Institute, in a news release (http://nnw.fm/E5Ecm) headlined ""Cannabinoids remove plaque-forming Alzheimer's proteins from brain cells,"" revealed that its scientists had found preliminary evidence ""that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and other compounds found in marijuana can promote the cellular removal of amyloid beta, a toxic protein associated with Alzheimer's disease."" A look at other approaches in the market emphasizes the unique position occupied by IGC, as well as the exciting potential of ongoing research. Anavex Life Sciences (AVXL), for example, is focused on research aimed at treating more than just the symptoms of Alzheimer's. The company's lead candidate, Anavex 2-73, recently completed a phase 2a trial in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease, showing a favorable safety and bioavailability profile and dose response curve. Early preclinical studies generated a great deal of excitement, because they indicated that Anavex 2-73 could potentially halt or reverse the course of Alzheimer's disease through restoration of the body's homeostasis, according to a report (http://nnw.fm/uN7LN).   At Axovant Sciences AXON, -1.48% an air of expectation is mounting as the company anxiously awaits the outcome of a phase 3 trial, started in 2015, for its lead Alzheimer's candidate, intepirdine. Results are expected by the end of September 2017. Axovant's drug works in conjunction with another Alzheimer's drug currently in use, donepezil, and acts on the 5HT6 receptor as an antagonist. While donepezil inhibits the loss of acetylcholine, a chemical in the brain that transmits signals, intepirdine appears to increase the production of that vital medium. 21 In August, AC Immune ACIU, -0.58% announced the discovery of new antibodies that target biomarkers other than Aβ and tau. A news release (http://nnw.fm/WA9xS) reports that ""These next-generation antibodies were discovered using the company's proprietary SupraAntigen™ platform, which has already generated four products in clinical development, including crenezumab partnered with Genentech/Roche in Phase 3 for Alzheimer's."" Biogen BIIB, +0.74% has also joined the quest for an Alzheimer's elixir. Its experimental drug to treat the condition, aducanumab, is now in pivotal trials. The company's valuation soared by more than a billion dollars after analysts at Goldman Sachs GS, +1.00% added it to their Equity Conviction List, according to the Boston Business Journal (http://nnw.fm/HlL7E). These efforts to defeat Alzheimer's are fueled by compelling incentives. Some 5.5 million Americans suffer from the malady, which kills more than breast cancer and prostate cancer combined. The market potential of a remedy has been estimated at over $5 billion, putting IGC at a sweet spot in the conjecture of the medicinal applications of THC and disease treatment.

Go directly to your stock of interest and access today's free coverage at: http://protraderdaily.com/optin/?symbol=MBRX http://protraderdaily.com/optin/?symbol=ACIU The EMA is the European equivalent to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and oversees the approval of new drugs for the European Union. Why the meeting? Moleculin stated that its planned clinical trial for Annamycin in the US and Poland which may begin shortly, dependent upon the filing and allowance of an IND with the FDA. The Company wants to be in a position to move quickly with Annamycin in the rest of Europe. This meeting will lay the groundwork for expanding Annamycin's market throughout the European Union. What is Annamycin? Annamycin is an anthracycline intended for the treatment of relapsed or refractory AML. The predated therapy of combining two chemotherapeutic drugs, which includes an anthracycline, in inducing a remission of leukemic cells (induction therapy) has not improved since it was first used in the 1970s, and as per Moleculin's estimate this induction therapy has the same cure rate of approximately 20% as at that time. Currently, the only viable long-term option for acute leukemia patients is a bone marrow transplant, which is successful in a significant number of patients. However, in order to qualify for a bone marrow transplant, patients have to first undergo induction therapy. The Rationale for the drug development Moleculin stated that one of the leading anthracyclines used for induction therapy in acute leukemia patients is doxorubicin. Medicines such as doxorubicin are cardio-toxic, which can result in damage to the heart and limit the dosage amount that may be administered to patients. Additionally, the tumor cells being treated often develop resistance to the first line anthracycline, often through what is called ""multidrug resistance"" making them capable of purging themselves of the current anthracyclines and limiting the effectiveness of the therapy. Consequently, there remains no effective therapy for these patients. Annamycin is a unique liposome formulated anthracycline that has been designed to eliminate cardio-toxicity and avoid the multidrug resistance mechanisms that often defeat current anthracyclines. In animal models designed to test for cardio-toxicity, Annamycin has demonstrated to be non-cardio-toxic and in human clinical trials focused on leukemia, it showed fewer dose-limiting toxicities than are normally experienced with doxorubicin. Annamycin demonstrated efficacy in 8 of 16 patients in a Phase-I study in adult relapsed or refractory AML patients, with 6 of 14 patients completely clearing leukemic blasts. A 30 patient dose-ranging Phase-I/II study in acute lymphocytic leukemia demonstrated a similar efficacy profile, with 3 of 8 patients treated with the maximum tolerable dose clearing their leukemic blasts to a level sufficient to qualify for a bone marrow transplant. Prospects for Annamycin Based on initial conversations with the FDA, and because of this serious unmet medical need, Moleculin believes Annamycin may qualify for accelerated approval. The Company also believes Annamycin may qualify for Orphan Drug status, which could entitle the Company to market exclusivity of up to 7 and 10 years from the date of approval of a New Drug Application and Marketing Authorization, in the US and the European Union, respectively. Last Close Stock Review On Wednesday, August 23, 2017, the stock closed the trading session flat at $2.42. A total volume of 250.29 thousand shares have exchanged hands. Moleculin Biotech's stock price skyrocketed 20.40% in the last one month, 157.72% in the past three months, and 130.48% in the previous six months. Furthermore, since the start of the year, shares of the Company have gained 6.14%. The stock currently has a market cap of $52.56 million.

ACIU,"Aug 22, 2017 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE via COMTEX) -- Pipeline expansion with new antibodies against alpha-synuclein and TDP-43 Proprietary scientific approach rapidly delivers high-quality assets Execution of clear strategy around three pillars Alzheimer's disease Other significant neurodegenerative and neuro-orphan indications Diagnostics Lausanne, Switzerland, August 22, 2017 - AC Immune SA ACIU, -0.58% a Swiss-based, clinical stage biopharmaceutical company with a broad pipeline focused on neurodegenerative diseases, today announced it has discovered new antibodies against two targets in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. Alpha-synuclein is an established target for Parkinson's disease and other Lewy body diseases, while TDP-43 is a recently identified target of growing interest for neuro-orphan indications such as Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration. More interestingly, both targets also play an important role in other significant neurodegenerative indications such as Alzheimer's disease, beyond the established hallmarks of Abeta and Tau. These next-generation antibodies were discovered using the company's proprietary SupraAntigen(TM) platform, which has already generated four products in clinical development, including crenezumab partnered with Genentech/Roche in Phase 3 for Alzheimer's. Prof. Andrea Pfeifer, CEO of AC Immune said: ""We are very pleased to move these next-generation antibodies into our discovery pipeline. They have significant potential for addressing the underlying pathology of a range of unmet indications, and reinforce our belief that precision medicine is critical to delivering effective treatments in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative diseases. We are executing a clear strategy around three pillars: Alzheimer's disease, other significant neurodegenerative diseases and neuro-orphan indications, and diagnostics. Our unique combination of scientific knowledge and assets continues to expand our high-value pipeline of candidates for both in-house development and partnerships."" Andreas Muhs, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of AC Immune, added: ""Many neurodegenerative diseases share their mode-of-action and targets, which provides opportunities for synergistic development of product candidates. Our common scientific approach to proteinopathies complemented with proprietary diagnostics, consistently and rapidly delivers new high-quality treatments for precision medicine in neurodegenerative diseases. These two latest antibody programs have unique binding properties to only the pathological forms of alpha-synuclein and TDP-43, and we are encouraged by the observations of expert groups on their potential attributes as novel therapeutics."" Powerful combination of therapeutics and diagnostics The Company believes it will generate additional value by leveraging its deep understanding and experience in Alzheimer's disease into other significant and neuro-orphan indications. Our unique immunotherapy approach addresses and treats the underlying misfolding of proteinopathies that causes neurodegenerative diseases, rather than simply treating the symptoms. Moreover, the company pairs early detection diagnostics with therapeutic candidates to ensure better clinical trials, superior patient care and reduced costs in development. The two antibody discovery programs announced today use the Company's SupraAntigen(TM) platform. They complement the R&D collaboration with Biogen (announced April 2016) comprised of two radiopharmaceutical diagnostic programs to develop PET-ligands for both alpha-synuclein and TDP-43, using AC Immune's proprietary Morphomer(TM) chemistry technology platform, designed to interact with the basic process of protein misfolding. These latest antibody discovery programs reflect the growing body of evidence about the benefits of targeting pathological elements (Brettscheider et al, Nature Reviews 2015) and the different modelling techniques used to generate specific binding properties of compounds. AC Immune is collaborating with various expert groups to elucidate the exact mode of action of the two next-generation antibodies. About alpha-synuclein Alpha-synuclein is a protein expressed principally in the central nervous system, but is also produced in other tissues. The pathological form of this protein is a major component of Lewy bodies, clumps of aggregated protein that are a cardinal neuropathological feature of Parkinson's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies and multiple system atrophy. The recently identified mechanism of spreading of the alpha-synuclein pathology in neurodegenerative diseases make alpha-synuclein a target for this antibody program. About TDP-43 TDP-43 (TAR DNA binding protein 43) is a new target in the area of neurodegenerative diseases. Misfolded, aggregated TDP-43 is found in diseases as Frontotemporal Lobar Degeneration (FTLD-TDP), chronic traumatic encephalopathy and Huntington's disease. There is growing body of evidence that the pathological TDP-43 protein plays an important role in multiple neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. The link of clinical features associated with Alzheimer's (Josephs et al, Acta Neuropathol., 2014) and the mechanism of spreading of the pathology make TDP-43 a target for this antibody program. About AC Immune AC Immune is a clinical stage Swiss-based biopharmaceutical company focused on neurodegenerative diseases with four product candidates in clinical trials. The Company designs, discovers and develops therapeutic and diagnostic products intended to prevent and modify diseases caused by misfolding proteins. AC Immune's two proprietary technology platforms create antibodies, small molecules and vaccines designed to address a broad spectrum of neurodegenerative indications, such as Alzheimer's disease. The Company's pipeline features seven therapeutic and three diagnostic product candidates. The most advanced of these is crenezumab, an anti-Abeta antibody in phase 3 clinical studies that is being advanced by the collaboration partner Genentech, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Roche. Other business partners include Biogen, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Nestl� Institute of Health Sciences, Piramal Imaging and Essex Bio-Technology.

ACIU,"NEW YORK, June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire via COMTEX/ -- NEW YORK, June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alzheimer's disease is a devastating brain disorder that now affects about 5.3 million Americans, accounting for one in nine people over the age of 65, according to the Alzheimer's Association. One in three seniors die with the disease or another form of dementia, and, while treatments to slow or stop the disease's progression have been lacking, several pharmaceutical companies are working to change that; India Globalization Capital, Inc. IGC, +1.34% (IGC Profile), which has products that are backed by data of cannabis-based combination therapies to treat Alzheimer's, pain, seizures and a host of neurological and oncological issues, is lined up with Biogen, Inc. BIIB, +0.74% Anavex Life Sciences Corp. AVXL, +0.00% Axovant Sciences Ltd. AXON, -1.48% and AC Immune SA ACIU, -0.58% to develop medications they hope will yield promising results in treating a difficult and hard to treat illness. The cost to the U.S. economy from Alzheimer's disease is estimated at $236 billion, including the costs of caring for individuals with the illness. Without effective treatments, the economic impact will continue to climb. While industry behemoths like Pfizer and Novartis are obvious contenders, India Globalization Capital (IGC) is the first cannabis pharmaceutical company to focus on Alzheimer's disease. While there are more than a dozen publicly traded cannabis pharmaceutical stocks on the market, most of them with market caps much larger than IGC's $12 million, IGC is so far the only one to apply its cannabis-therapies to the treatment of Alzheimer's. IGC is aggressively advancing its unique position, and earlier this week announced (http://nnw.fm/3QaWV) that it has acquired the exclusive rights to a THC-based treatment for Alzheimer's, moving the company one step closer to clinical trials for its Alzheimer's product. Under a definitive license agreement with the University of South Florida, IGC is the exclusive licensee of a patent filing for the use of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) as a potential therapeutic agent for the disease. The patent, entitled ""THC as a Potential Therapeutic Agent for Alzheimer's Disease,"" claims discovery of a new pathway in which low doses of THC bind to amyloid beta plaques and prevent those plaques from aggregating on neurons, which is what occurs in Alzheimer's disease and causes cognitive decline. Here's why the application of TCH (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is the psychoactive compound found in cannabis, is so exciting for the future of Alzheimer's treatment. THC has several known molecular pathways by which it interacts with the body. Numerous studies have shown that low doses of THC can slow the production of neural plaques (considered a key contributor to the progression of Alzheimer's), as well as decrease inflammation, prevent cell death and stimulate cell growth. The acquisition of IGC's new patent filing provides another layer of protection for the company's proprietary formulation of IGC-AD1, which includes low-doses of THC and is intended to disrupt the buildup of amyloid beta plaques and relieve some of the worst symptoms of Alzheimer's. If the patent is granted, and it works, IGC will become the owner of a major therapeutic pathway for THC interaction with the body, with significant potential in treating this condition. ""Securing this licensing agreement from the University of South Florida represents a major turning point for IGC as we now look to prepare several of our key products for clinical trials,"" IGC CEO Ram Mukunda stated in the press release. ""We have worked hard to assemble a strong development team and a primary pipeline of four major products addressing large markets and possible blockbuster indications utilizing cannabis-based therapies. We are putting the finishing touches on our products, which may include filing additional patents, and we very much expect to start pursuing clinical trials for our Alzheimer's product and others this year."" IGC's drug development pipeline also includes cannabinoid therapy that targets human and veterinary epilepsy (http://nnw.fm/eW8gb). The company is developing numerous cannabis-based therapies, with a potential international market reach. There are some other companies working on Alzheimer's with very large valuations, with IGC bringing the potential benefits of cannabis to bear on the disease. Biogen BIIB, +0.74% has developed and tested aducanumab, a drug that helps eliminate beta amyloid, a sticky plaque found in the brain of Alzheimer's patients. The antibody binds to the plaque, which has the potential to slow the progression of symptoms such as memory loss, confusion, trouble finding words, decreases in judgement, and changes in mood and personality. Phase 1 clinical trials included 165 patients, concluding that high doses of the drug decreased the level of amyloid plaque in the brain, as viewed using positron emission tomography. Scientists noted the slowing of the progression of memory loss in these patients as well. Another company focused on the development of innovative therapies for Alzheimer's, other central nervous system diseases (CNS) and various types of cancer, is New York-based Anavex Life Sciences AVXL, +0.00% The company's lead product candidate, ANAVEX™ 2-73, is an oral drug currently in phase 2a clinical trials for Alzheimer's, and is also being tested to Parkinson's and other CNS diseases. Phase 1 trials for ANAVEX™ 2-73 were completed with encouraging results attesting to the compound's potential to halt or even reverse the course of Alzheimer's, as well as with an indication of other anticonvulsant, neuroprotective and antidepressant properties. A phase 2 placebo-controlled trial is also underway to determine ANAVEX™2-73 effects on Rett Syndrome, while a separate trial is being conducted for Parkinson's disease. In addition to ANAVEX™2-73, the company is developing several other products targeting various symptoms and effects of Alzheimer's. Clinical studies are also underway for Axovant Sciences' AXON, -1.48% lead product candidate, Intepirdine (RVT-101), and its effects on Alzheimer's, dementia and Lewy Body Dementia. The Mindset study for Alzheimer's is a phase 3 international, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled clinical trial that aims to assess the tolerability, safety and efficacy of the drug for mild and moderate cases of Alzheimer's. If the trials are successful, the therapy will be approved for commercialization across Europe and the United States. Phase 2 studies are being conducted to evaluate the product's performance for dementia. A novel glycopyrrolate and cholinesterase combination is also being developed for Alzheimer's and Lewy Body Dementia and is currently in phase 1 trials. One of the world's largest Alzheimer's treatment pipelines is being developed by Swiss-based AC Immune SA ACIU, -0.58% The company is working on seven therapeutic and three diagnostic products in various stages of clinical trials; with the potential to significantly improve treatment and even prevent Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases. All of AC Immune's therapies were discovered and developed via the company's proprietary Morphomer™ and SupraAntigen™ technology platforms. The lead product candidate, an anti-Abeta antibody called Crenezumab with treatment and prevention potential, is currently undergoing phase 3 clinical trials, in collaboration with Roche Holding AG RHHBY, -0.61% subsidiary, Genentech.   The focus on Alzheimer's by so many biopharmaceutical companies is understandable, given the prevalence of this condition. In May 2017, Congress signed into law a $400 million increase for Alzheimer's research funding at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the fiscal year 2017 budget, marking the second consecutive year that Congress has approved a 'historic' funding increase for the disease. This move demonstrates the urgency for the more than 5 million Americans living with the disease - a number that's forecast to increase to 16 million by 2050 - and highlights the value of the lineup of companies working to advance their efforts for a cure.

The increase in revenues was mainly driven by the EUR 1 million (CHF 1.1 million) milestones from Piramal Imaging for the initiation of the Phase 1 clinical trial in an orphan indication, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP). Research & Development (R&D) Expenses For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company incurred R&D expenses of CHF 7.5 million compared with CHF 5.4 million in the same period in 2016. This is primarily attributable to increased investment in the two anti-Abeta ACI-24 vaccine programs in Alzheimer's disease and Down syndrome, in programs focused on Parkinson's disease such as alpha-synuclein PET imaging, and in discovery programs for neurodegenerative orphan indications. The R&D investment also reflects the addition of new talents to accelerate the development of proprietary and partnered pipeline candidates. General and Administrative (G&A) Expenses G&A expenses amounted to CHF 2.4 million in the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared with CHF 0.9 million in the same period in 2016. The increase in G&A expenses is largely related to advisory, regulatory and legal costs associated with the Company being publicly listed since September 2016, intellectual property costs as well as remuneration expenses. Loss for the period For the three months ended March 31, 2017, the Company had a net loss after taxes of CHF 9.5 million compared with a CHF 6.2 million loss for the same period in 2016. The decline in profitability is attributable to the increased R&D and G&A expenses as outlined above. Balance Sheet As of March 31, 2017 AC Immune had total cash of CHF 138.1 million compared to CHF 152.2 million as of December 31, 2017. The decrease is due to the higher investments in our major discovery and development programs and the strengthening of the Company's infrastructures, systems and organization.
