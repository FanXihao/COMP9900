We have based the forward-looking statements included in this quarterly report on information available to us on the date of this quarterly report, and we assume no obligation to update any such forward-looking statements. Overview We are a specialty finance company primarily engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate (""CRE"") loans and related investments. We are externally managed by ACREM, a subsidiary of Ares Management, L.P. (NYSE: We were formed and commenced operations in late 2011. We are a Maryland corporation and completed our initial public offering in May 2012. We have elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to the extent that we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to stockholders and comply with various other requirements as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. We are an ""emerging growth company,"" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not ""emerging growth companies."" In addition, we chose to ""opt out"" of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. We could remain an ""emerging growth company"" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (ii) the date that we become a ""large accelerated filer"" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. Unless any of the above criteria are met earlier, starting December 31, 2017, we will no longer be treated as an ""emerging growth company."" Developments During the Third Quarter of 2017: ACRE originated an $18.1 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in California. ACRE originated a $39.7 million senior mortgage loan on a student housing property located in North Carolina. ACRE originated a $27.5 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in Texas. ACRE amended the MetLife Facility (as defined below) to extend the initial maturity date to August 12, 2020 and decrease the interest rate on advances under the MetLife Facility to a per annum rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.30%. The initial maturity date of the MetLife Facility is subject to two 12-month extensions, each of which may be exercised at our option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee, which, if both were exercised, would extend the maturity date of the MetLife Facility to August 12, 2022.  Factors Impacting Our Operating Results The results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial mortgage loans, CRE debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which reflects the amortization of origination fees and direct costs, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, credit worthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers. Investment Portfolio As of September 30, 2017, our portfolio totaled 36 loans held for investment, excluding 55 loans that were repaid or sold since inception. Such investments are referred to herein as our investment portfolio. As of September 30, 2017, the aggregate originated commitment under these loans at closing was approximately $1.7 billion and outstanding principal was $1.6 billion. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we funded approximately $504.6 million of outstanding principal and received repayments of $263.4 million of outstanding principal, excluding non-controlling interests held by third parties. As of September 30, 2017, 89.3% of our loans have London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") floors, with a weighted average floor of 0.61%, calculated based on loans with LIBOR floors. References to LIBOR or ""L"" are to 30-day LIBOR (unless otherwise specifically stated). Other than as set forth in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, as of September 30, 2017, all loans were paying in accordance with their contractual terms. During the nine months ended September 30, 2017, there were no impairments with respect to our loans held for investment. Our loans held for investment are accounted for at amortized cost. The following table summarizes our loans held for investment as of September 30, 2017 ($ in thousands):  As of September 30, 2017 Weighted Average Weighted Weighted Minimum Average Average Loan Unleveraged Remaining Carrying Outstanding Borrowing Effective Life Amount (1) Principal (1) Spread (2) Yield (3) (Years) Senior mortgage loans $ 1,483,786 $ 1,492,488 4.8 % 6.0 % 1.7 Subordinated debt and preferred equity investments 59,475 60,276 10.3 % 11.4 % 3.2 Total loans held for investment portfolio $ 1,543,261 $ 1,552,764 5.0 % 6.2 % 1.8  (1) The difference between the Carrying Amount and the Outstanding Principal amount of the loans held for investment consists of unamortized purchase discount, deferred loan fees and loan origination costs. (2) Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread is equal to (a) for floating rate loans, the margin above the applicable index rate (e.g., LIBOR) plus floors, if any, on such applicable index rates, and (b) for fixed rate loans, the applicable interest rate. (3) Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premium or discount) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The Total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by us as of September 30, 2017 as weighted by the Outstanding Principal balance of each loan. Non-Controlling Interests The non-controlling interests held by third parties in our consolidated financial statements represent the equity interests in ACRC KA Investor LLC (""ACRC KA"") that are not owned by us. In January 2017, our investment in ACRC KA was repaid in full. Accordingly, as of September 30, 2017, our investment was no longer outstanding. A reconciliation of our interest income from loans held for investment, excluding non-controlling interests, to our interest income from loans held for investment as included within our consolidated statements of operations is as follows ($ in thousands):  For the three months For the nine months ended September 30, 2017 ended September 30, 2017 Interest income from loans held for investment, excluding non-controlling interests $ 28,551 $ 72,286 Interest income from non-controlling interest investment held by third parties - 35 Interest income from loans held for investment $ 28,551 $ 72,321  See Notes 6 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for more information about ACRC KA. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which describes recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet required to be adopted by us.

The weighted average borrowings under the Wells Fargo Facility, the Citibank Facility, the BAML Facility, the CNB Facility, the MetLife Facility, the UBS Facility and the U.S. Bank Facility (individually defined above or below and collectively, the ""Secured Funding Agreements"") and securitization debt and the Secured Term Loan (defined above) were $1.2 billion for the three months ended September 30, 2017 and $850.9 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 (which included one facility which was subsequently paid in full). The increase in interest income from loans held for investment and interest expense for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in our weighted average earning assets and weighted average borrowings for the three months ended September 30, 2017.

The following table summarizes our loans held for investment as of June 30, 2017 ($ in thousands):  As of June 30, 2017 Weighted Average Weighted Weighted Minimum Average Average Loan Unleveraged Remaining Carrying Outstanding Borrowing Effective Life Amount (1) Principal (1) Spread (2) Yield (3) (Years) Senior mortgage loans $ 1,529,155 $ 1,538,370 4.8 % 6.0 % 1.9 Subordinated debt and preferred equity investments 112,280 113,392 10.7 % 11.8 % 3.2 Total loans held for investment portfolio $ 1,641,435 $ 1,651,762 5.2 % 6.4 % 2.0  (1) The difference between the Carrying Amount and the Outstanding Principal amount of the loans held for investment consists of unamortized purchase discount, deferred loan fees and loan origination costs. (2) Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread is equal to (a) for floating rate loans, the margin above the applicable index rate (e.g., LIBOR) plus floors, if any, on such applicable index rates, and (b) for fixed rate loans, the applicable interest rate. (3) Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premium or discount) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The Total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by us as of June 30, 2017 as weighted by the Outstanding Principal balance of each loan. Non-Controlling Interests The non-controlling interests held by third parties in our consolidated financial statements represent the equity interests in ACRC KA Investor LLC (""ACRC KA"") that are not owned by us. In January 2017, our investment in ACRC KA was repaid in full. Accordingly, as of June 30, 2017, our investment was no longer outstanding.

Overview We are a specialty finance company primarily engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate (""CRE"") loans and related investments. We are externally managed by ACREM, a subsidiary of Ares Management, L.P. (NYSE: We were formed and commenced operations in late 2011. We are a Maryland corporation and completed our initial public offering in May 2012. We have elected and qualified to be taxed as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, commencing with our taxable year ended December 31, 2012. We generally will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes on our REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and excluding net capital gains, to the extent that we annually distribute all of our REIT taxable income to stockholders and comply with various other requirements as a REIT. We also operate our business in a manner that will permit us to maintain our exemption from registration under the 1940 Act. We are an ""emerging growth company,"" as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not ""emerging growth companies."" In addition, we chose to ""opt out"" of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. We could remain an ""emerging growth company"" for up to five years, or until the earliest of (i) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.0 billion, (ii) the date that we become a ""large accelerated filer"" as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (iii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the preceding three-year period. Developments During the First Quarter of 2017: ACRE originated a $31.4 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in New York. ACRE originated a $24.1 million senior mortgage loan on a student housing property located in Alabama. ACRE originated a $24.4 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in California. ACRE originated a $53.8 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in Florida. ACRC Lender LLC, a subsidiary of ACRE, amended the March 2014 CNB Facility (as defined below) to extend the initial maturity date to March 11, 2018. ACRE Commercial Mortgage 2017-FL3 Ltd. (the ""Issuer"") and ACRE Commercial Mortgage 2017-FL3 LLC, both wholly owned indirect subsidiaries of ACRE, issued approximately $272.9 million principal balance secured floating rate notes (the ""Offered Notes"") to a third party. ACRE is retaining (through one of its wholly owned subsidiaries) approximately $68.2 million of the non-investment grade notes (together with the Offered Notes, the ""Notes"") and the preferred equity of the Issuer (the ""CLO Securitization"").  Factors Impacting Our Operating Results The results of our operations are affected by a number of factors and primarily depend on, among other things, the level of our net interest income, the market value of our assets and the supply of, and demand for, commercial mortgage loans, CRE debt and other financial assets in the marketplace. Our net interest income, which reflects the amortization of origination fees and direct costs, is recognized based on the contractual rate and the outstanding principal balance of the loans we originate. Interest rates will vary according to the type of investment, conditions in the financial markets, credit worthiness of our borrowers, competition and other factors, none of which can be predicted with any certainty. Our operating results may also be impacted by credit losses in excess of initial anticipations or unanticipated credit events experienced by borrowers. Investment Portfolio As of March 31, 2017, our portfolio totaled 32 loans held for investment, excluding 50 loans that were repaid or sold since inception. Such investments are referred to herein as our investment portfolio. As of March 31, 2017, the aggregate originated commitment under these loans at closing was approximately $1.5 billion and outstanding principal was $1.4 billion. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we funded approximately $133.5 million of outstanding principal and received repayments of $65.0 million of outstanding principal, excluding non-controlling interests held by third parties. As of March 31, 2017, 86.9% of our loans have London Interbank Offered Rates (""LIBOR"") floors, with a weighted average floor of 0.42%, calculated based on loans with LIBOR floors. References to LIBOR or ""L"" are to 30-day LIBOR (unless otherwise specifically stated). As of March 31, 2017, all loans were paying in accordance with their contractual terms. During the three months ended March 31, 2017, there were no impairments with respect to our loans held for investment. Our loans held for investment are accounted for at amortized cost. The following table summarizes our loans held for investment as of March 31, 2017 ($ in thousands):  As of March 31, 2017 Weighted Weighted Average Average Weighted Unleveraged Remaining Carrying Outstanding Average Effective Life Amount (1) Principal (1) Interest Rate Yield (2) (Years) Senior mortgage loans $ 1,259,843 $ 1,266,746 4.7 % 5.9 % 1.8 Subordinated debt and preferred equity investments 112,235 113,392 10.7 % 11.7 % 3.5 Total loans held for investment portfolio $ 1,372,078 $ 1,380,138 5.2 % 6.4 % 1.9  (1) The difference between the Carrying Amount and the Outstanding Principal face amount of the loans held for investment consists of unamortized purchase discount, deferred loan fees and loan origination costs. (2) Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premium or discount) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The Total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by us as of March 31, 2017 as weighted by the Outstanding Principal balance of each loan. Non-Controlling Interests The non-controlling interests held by third parties in our consolidated financial statements represent the equity interests in ACRC KA Investor LLC (""ACRC KA"") that are not owned by us. In January 2017, our investment in ACRC KA was repaid in full. Accordingly, as of March 31, 2017, our investment was no longer outstanding. A reconciliation of our interest income from loans held for investment, excluding non-controlling interests, to our interest income from loans held for investment as included within our consolidated statements of operations is as follows ($ in thousands): See Notes 6 and 12 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for more information about ACRC KA. Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors management believes to be reasonable. Actual results may differ from those estimates and assumptions. There have been no significant changes to our critical accounting policies as disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016. See Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q, which describes recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet required to be adopted by us. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table sets forth a summary of our consolidated results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 ($ thousands):  For the three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Net interest margin $ 10,339 $ 10,225 Total expenses 3,793 3,462 Income from continuing operations before income taxes 6,546 6,763 Income tax expense, including excise tax 68 4 Net income from continuing operations 6,478 6,759 Net loss from operations of discontinued operations, net of income taxes - (334 ) Net income attributable to ACRE 6,478 6,425 Less: Net income attributable to non-controlling interests (25 ) (1,289 ) Net income attributable to common stockholders $ 6,453 $ 5,136  The following tables set forth select details of our consolidated results of operations from continuing operations for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016 ($ thousands): Net Interest Margin For the three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Interest income from loans held for investment $ 21,127 $ 18,750 Interest expense (10,788 ) (8,525 ) Net interest margin $ 10,339 $ 10,225  For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, net interest margin was approximately $10.3 million and $10.2 million, respectively. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, interest income from loans held for investment of $21.1 million and $18.8 million, respectively, was generated by weighted average earning assets of $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, offset by $10.8 million and $8.5 million, respectively, of interest expense, unused fees and amortization of deferred loan costs. The weighted average borrowings under the Wells Fargo Facility, the Citibank Facility, the BAML Facility, the March 2014 CNB Facility, the MetLife Facility, the April 2014 UBS Facility and the U.S. Bank Facility (individually defined above or below and collectively, the ""Secured Funding Agreements"") and securitization debt and the Secured Term Loan (defined above) were $983.9 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and $845.0 million for the three months ended March 31, 2016 (which included two facilities which were subsequently paid in full). The increase in net interest margin for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in our weighted average earning assets for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Operating Expenses The operating expenses below do not include expenses of ACRE Capital. See Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q for more information about the operating expenses of ACRE Capital. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 2016 Management and incentive fees to affiliate $ 1,812 $ 1,352 Professional fees 391 490 General and administrative expenses 642 723 General and administrative expenses reimbursed to affiliate 948 897 Total expenses $ 3,793 $ 3,462  For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, we incurred operating expenses of $3.8 million and $3.5 million, respectively. The increase in operating expenses for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily relates to incentive fees due to our Manager for the three months ended March 31, 2017 and an increase in management fees due to our Manager that were allocated to continuing operations subsequent to the closing of the sale of ACRE Capital on September 30, 2016. Related Party Expenses For the three months ended March 31, 2017, related party expenses included $1.5 million in management fees due to our Manager and $0.9 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, related party expenses included $1.4 million in management fees due to our Manager and $0.9 million for our share of allocable general and administrative expenses for which we were required to reimburse our Manager pursuant to the Management Agreement. The increase in management fees due to our Manager for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily relates to an increase in management fees that were allocated to continuing operations subsequent to the closing of the sale of ACRE Capital on September 30, 2016. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, related party expenses also included $0.3 million in incentive fees due to our Manager. For the three months ended March 31, 2016, there were no incentive fees due to our Manager. Other Expenses For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, professional fees were $0.4 million and $0.5 million, respectively. The decrease in professional fees for the three months ended March 31, 2017 compared to the three months ended March 31, 2016 primarily relates to a decrease in our use of third party professionals due to changes in transaction activity year over year. For the three months ended March 31, 2017 and 2016, general and administrative expenses were $0.6 million and $0.7 million, respectively, which was relatively consistent year over year. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Liquidity is a measure of our ability to meet potential cash requirements, including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings, fund and maintain our assets and operations, make distributions to our stockholders and other general business needs. We use significant cash to purchase our target investments, make principal and interest payments on our borrowings, make distributions to our stockholders and fund our operations. Our primary sources of cash generally consist of unused borrowing capacity under our Secured Funding Agreements, the net proceeds of future offerings, payments of principal and interest we receive on our portfolio of assets and cash generated from our operating activities. However, principal repayments from mortgage loans in securitizations where we retain the subordinate securities are applied sequentially, first used to pay down the senior notes, and accordingly, we will not receive any proceeds from repayment of loans in the securitizations until all senior notes are repaid in full. Subject to maintaining our qualification as a REIT and our exemption from the 1940 Act, we expect that our primary sources of financing will be, to the extent available to us, through (a) credit, secured funding and other lending facilities, (b) securitizations, (c) other sources of private financing, including warehouse and repurchase facilities, and (d) public or private offerings of our equity or debt securities.

ACRE,"NEW YORK, Mar 01, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (the “Company”) ACRE, +0.00% a specialty finance company engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate assets, reported generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) net income of $6.2 million or $0.22 per diluted common share and Core Earnings [(1)] of $7.2 million or $0.25 per diluted common share [] for the fourth quarter of 2017. The Company reported GAAP net income of $30.4 million or $1.07 per diluted common share and Core Earnings [(1)] of $32.1 million or $1.13 per diluted common share for the full-year of 2017. In addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a first quarter 2018 dividend of $0.28 per common share payable on April 17, 2018 to common stockholders of record on March 29, 2018, which is the third consecutive annual dividend increase of $0.01 per common share. “We had a strong finish to 2017 with more than $400 million of originations in the fourth quarter and a record $956 million for the full year, reflecting progress on recent initiatives to enhance our market coverage and origination capabilities,” said Jamie Henderson, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACRE. “Based in part upon an improved earnings outlook for 2018, our board of directors has authorized an increase in our first quarter dividend to $0.28 per common share.” “Throughout 2017, we continued to work on improving the cost and efficient use of our capital to enhance our profitability. During the year, we meaningfully reduced the pricing on our $110 million secured term loan, closed an attractively priced $273 million privately placed securitization and added $236 million of warehouse capacity,” said Tae-Sik Yoon, Chief Financial Officer of ACRE. “Going forward, our goal will be to maintain near full deployment of our capital, which we believe will result in higher and more consistent earnings in 2018. In addition, given that 99% of our loans as of December 31, 2017 are floating rate, we believe our earnings and dividends provide excellent inflation protection in a rising interest rate environment.” THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2017 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Financial Results and Activities: For the three months ended December 31, 2017, GAAP net income was $6.2 million or $0.22 per diluted common share and Core Earnings [(1)] was $7.2 million or $0.25 per diluted common share. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, new originations were $416.0 million in commitments and $387.3 million in outstanding principal funded at the origination date and an additional $8.5 million of fundings on existing commitments. For the three months ended December 31, 2017, the Company exited $211.2 million of loans held for investment as measured by outstanding principal. _________________________________ (1) Core Earnings is a non-GAAP financial measure. Refer to Schedule I for further details. Capital Activities: In October 2017, the Company amended the Bridge Loan Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. to decrease the interest rate on advances under the facility from a per annum rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 2.25% to 2.75% to a per annum rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.00%.

Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as net income (loss) computed in accordance with GAAP, excluding non-cash equity compensation expense, the incentive fee, depreciation and amortization (to the extent that any of the Company’s target investments are structured as debt and the Company forecloses on any properties underlying such debt), any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income (loss) for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss), one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP, and certain non-cash charges after discussions between the Company’s external manager and the Company’s independent directors and after approval by a majority of the Company’s independent directors.

ACRE,"NEW YORK, Jan 08, 2018 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation ACRE, +0.00% announced today that it closed $416 million in new loan commitments (with $387 million of initial fundings on these commitments) during the fourth quarter of 2017. The eleven new loan commitments included five multifamily loans, two commercial office loans, two student housing loans, a hospitality loan and an industrial loan. Ten of the eleven commitments were senior, floating rate loans and all loans were located in primary and secondary markets across the U.S. During 2017, new loan commitments totaled $956 million, setting a new annual record for ACRE. In addition, ACRE exited $211 million of loan commitments in the fourth quarter of 2017, bringing the full year total of exited loan commitments to $475 million. “We are very pleased with the breadth and quality of our strong fourth quarter investment activity, which concluded a record year of originations for our company,” said Jamie Henderson, President and Chief Executive Officer of ACRE. “Our strong finish to the year and our promising current investment pipeline reflect the recent actions that we have taken to expand our market coverage and broaden the product expertise of our direct origination loan platform.” Amendment to Secured Term Loan On December 22, 2017, ACRE amended its $155 million secured term loan primarily to reduce all-in pricing from LIBOR plus 6.0% to LIBOR plus 5.0%, eliminate the 1.0% LIBOR floor, and extend the initial maturity by approximately two years to December 22, 2020 (plus a one-year extension option exercisable by the company subject to certain conditions). In addition, ACRE elected to prepay $45 million of the secured term loan reducing the outstanding principal balance from $155 million to $110 million, which will result in a one-time, non-cash charge of approximately $0.03 per share in the fourth quarter of 2017 related to a partial write-off of deferred financing expenses. Going forward, the amendment and extension of the secured term loan is expected to result in a meaningful reduction of interest expense for the company based on the reduction in borrowing spread and amortization of deferred financing expenses over the longer newly extended three-year remaining term. “Two of our important strategic objectives have been to improve the efficiency and cost of our funding and to prudently invest our excess capital,” said Tae-Sik Yoon, Chief Financial Officer of ACRE. “We have now executed on both goals as we significantly improved the all-in pricing on our term loan and we have now invested our excess capital into attractive investments. Given the timing of these activities, we expect to begin to receive the full earnings benefit starting in the first quarter of 2018.” Mr. Henderson continued, “With the enhancement of our origination platform, the investment of our excess capital into attractively earning assets and the favorable modification of our term loan, we expect a meaningful improvement in our earnings and to be better positioned to achieve our long-term profitability objectives in the future.” About Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation is a specialty finance company primarily engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate loans and related investments.

ACRE,"NEW YORK, Nov 01, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (the “Company”) ACRE, +0.00% a specialty finance company engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate assets, reported net income of $11.1 million or $0.39 per diluted common share for the third quarter of 2017. In addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a fourth quarter 2017 dividend of $0.27 per common share payable on January 16, 2018 to common stockholders of record as of December 29, 2017. “We generated stronger third quarter earnings, as we benefitted primarily from recent investment activity along with meaningful fees that we strategically build into our loans and are triggered upon repayments,” said James A. Henderson, Chief Executive Officer, President and Chief Investment Officer of ACRE. “Although the repayments temporarily reduced our earning assets at the end of the third quarter, our investment pipeline is strong and these new investments are expected to improve our earnings levels as we head into 2018.” THREE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2017 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Financial Results and Activities: For the three months ended September 30, 2017, net income was $11.1 million or $0.39 per diluted common share.

For the three months ended September 30, 2017, loan repayments totaled $181.7 million in outstanding principal. “Going forward, we expect to broaden our investment activities by more closely capitalizing on our relevant areas of expertise across the Ares real estate and credit platforms. We expect the expansion of our investment activities will further diversify our portfolio, enhance our ability to source investments with superior relative value and enable us to deploy capital more consistently,” continued Mr. Henderson. Capital Activities: “Supported by our strong balance sheet, we are well positioned to deploy a portion of our available capital in accretive investments,” said Tae-Sik Yoon, Chief Financial Officer of ACRE. “We believe we have the potential to further improve our earnings by reducing our funding costs and continuing to more efficiently manage our capital.” In August 2017, the Company amended the revolving master repurchase facility with Metropolitan Life Insurance Company (the “MetLife Facility”) to extend the initial maturity date to August 12, 2020. The initial maturity date of the MetLife Facility is subject to two 12-month extensions, each of which may be exercised at the Company’s option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee, which, if both were exercised, would extend the maturity date of the MetLife Facility to August 12, 2022. In addition, in August 2017, the Company decreased the interest rate on advances under the MetLife Facility to a per annum rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.30%.

(2) Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread is equal to (a) for floating rate loans, the margin above the applicable index rate (e.g., LIBOR) plus floors, if any, on such applicable index rates, and (b) for fixed rate loans, the applicable interest rate. (3) Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premium or discount) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The Total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by the Company as of September 30, 2017 as weighted by the Outstanding Principal balance of each loan. As of September 30, 2017, 98% of the portfolio of loans held for investment consisted of floating rate loans and 96% consisted of senior mortgage loans (as measured by outstanding principal).

(the “BAML Facility”). The purpose of the amendment was to, among other things, decrease the interest rate on advances under the BAML Facility to a per annum rate equal to one-month LIBOR plus a spread of 2.00%. On October 25, 2017, the Company originated a $19.2 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in Florida. At closing, the outstanding principal balance was approximately $18.3 million. The loan has a per annum interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.00% (plus fees) and an initial term of three years. As of October 31, 2017, the Company had approximately $190 million in capital, either in cash or in undrawn capacity expected to be available under its secured funding agreements. After holding in reserve $10 million in liquidity requirements, the Company expects to have approximately $180 million in capital available to fund new loans, fund outstanding commitments on existing loans and for other working capital and general corporate purposes. Assuming that the Company uses all such amount as capital to make new senior loans and the Company is able to leverage such amount under its secured funding agreements at a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.5:1, the Company would have the capacity to fund approximately $630 million of additional senior loans. As of October 31, 2017, the total unfunded commitments for the Company’s existing loans held for investment were approximately $97 million. In addition, borrowings under the Company’s secured funding agreements were approximately $713 million, borrowings under the Company’s secured term loan was approximately $155 million and debt issued in the form of a collateralized loan obligation was approximately $273 million. On November 1, 2017, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.27 per common share for the fourth quarter of 2017. The fourth quarter 2017 dividend is payable on January 16, 2018 to common stockholders of record as of December 29, 2017. THIRD QUARTER 2017 DIVIDEND On August 3, 2017, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.27 per common share for the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter 2017 dividend was paid on October 16, 2017 to common stockholders of record as of September 29, 2017.

ACRE,"NEW YORK, Aug 03, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation (the “Company”) ACRE, +0.00% a specialty finance company engaged in originating and investing in commercial real estate assets, reported net income of $6.7 million or $0.24 per diluted common share for the second quarter of 2017. In addition, the Company announced that its Board of Directors declared a third quarter 2017 dividend of $0.27 per common share payable on October 16, 2017 to common stockholders of record as of September 29, 2017. “After a strong second quarter of new investment activity, we believe we are on track to meet our investment targets for the year,” said Robert L. Rosen, Chairman of the Board and Interim Co-Chief Executive Officer of Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation. “Since the majority of our originations occurred late in the quarter, the earnings benefit from the growth in our portfolio is not fully reflected in our second quarter earnings. We remain well positioned to improve our quarterly earnings as we prudently deploy our significant level of available capital.” “In today’s market, we remain highly selective and use our competitive advantages to find market inefficiencies,” said Jamie Henderson, President and Chief Investment Officer of Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation. “Going forward, we intend to continue to broaden our product suite using the extensive Ares platform and seek to further diversify our portfolio with attractive risk adjusted return opportunities.” “Our $321 million of new loan commitments this quarter demonstrates our strong market presence and the demand from real estate sponsors and operators for our flexible capital solutions,” said John Jardine, Co-Chief Executive Officer of Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation. THREE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2017 FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS Financial Results and Activities: For the three months ended June 30, 2017, net income was $6.7 million or $0.24 per diluted common share. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, new originations were $320.8 million in commitments and $282.3 million in outstanding principal and an additional $6.1 million of fundings on existing commitments. For the three months ended June 30, 2017, loan repayments totaled $16.7 million in outstanding principal. Capital Activities: “We continue to maintain a diversified portfolio comprised predominately of senior, floating rate loans with strong credit quality,” said Tae-Sik Yoon, Chief Financial Officer of Ares Commercial Real Estate Corporation. “Under current market conditions, we believe we have opportunities to further reduce our cost of capital and manage our balance sheet more efficiently.” In May 2017, the Company amended the master repurchase funding facility with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the “Wells Fargo Facility”) to increase the facility’s commitment amount from $325.0 million to $500.0 million and extend the initial maturity date to December 14, 2018. The initial maturity date of the Wells Fargo Facility is subject to two 12-month extensions, each of which may be exercised at the Company’s option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee, which, if both were exercised, would extend the maturity date of the Wells Fargo Facility to December 14, 2020. In May 2017, the Company amended the Bridge Loan Warehousing Credit and Security Agreement with Bank of America, N.A. (the “BAML Facility”), which has a commitment amount of $125.0 million, to extend the period during which the Company may request individual loans under the facility to May 24, 2018. Individual advances under the BAML Facility generally have a two-year maturity, subject to one 12-month extension at the Company’s option upon the satisfaction of certain conditions and applicable extension fees being paid. In addition, the final maturity date of individual loans under the BAML Facility was extended to May 25, 2021. In June 2017, the Company amended the master repurchase and securities contract with U.S. Bank National Association (the “U.S. Bank Facility”) to increase the facility’s commitment amount from $125.0 million to $186.0 million and extend the initial maturity date to July 31, 2020. The initial maturity date of the U.S. Bank Facility is subject to two 12-month extensions, each of which may be exercised at the Company’s option, subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including payment of an extension fee, which, if both were exercised, would extend the maturity date of the U.S. Bank Facility to July 31, 2022. PORTFOLIO DETAIL AS OF JUNE 30, 2017 At June 30, 2017, the Company’s portfolio totaled 38 loans held for investment totaling approximately $1.8 billion in originated commitments at closing and $1.7 billion in outstanding principal. At June 30, 2017, 50 loans totaling approximately $1.5 billion in outstanding principal were repaid or sold since inception of the Company. Portfolio Interest Rate, Yield and Remaining Life Summary ($ in millions):     As of June 30, 2017 Carrying Amount (1)     Outstanding Principal (1)     Weighted Average Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread (2)     Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield (3)     Weighted Average Remaining Life (Years) Senior mortgage loans $ 1,529.1 $ 1,538.4 4.8% 6.0% 1.9 Subordinated debt and preferred equity investments 112.3   113.4   10.7% 11.8% 3.2 Total loans held for investment portfolio $ 1,641.4   $ 1,651.8   5.2% 6.4% 2.0       ______________________________________________________________________________ (1) The difference between the Carrying Amount and the Outstanding Principal amount of the loans held for investment consists of unamortized purchase discount, deferred loan fees and loan origination costs. (2) Minimum Loan Borrowing Spread is equal to (a) for floating rate loans, the margin above the applicable index rate (e.g., LIBOR) plus floors, if any, on such applicable index rates, and (b) for fixed rate loans, the applicable interest rate. (3) Unleveraged Effective Yield is the compounded effective rate of return that would be earned over the life of the investment based on the contractual interest rate (adjusted for any deferred loan fees, costs, premium or discount) and assumes no dispositions, early prepayments or defaults. The Total Weighted Average Unleveraged Effective Yield is calculated based on the average of Unleveraged Effective Yield of all loans held by the Company as of June 30, 2017 as weighted by the Outstanding Principal balance of each loan. As of June 30, 2017, 97% of the portfolio of loans held for investment consisted of floating rate loans and 93% consisted of senior mortgage loans (as measured by outstanding principal).   Portfolio Diversification Summary as of June 30, 2017 ($ in millions):   PROPERTY TYPE                     Outstanding Principal     % of Portfolio Office $ 526.2 32% Multifamily 465.1 27% Self Storage 192.8 12% Retail 133.6 8% Hotel 128.5 8% Student Housing 65.9 4% Mixed-use 65.6 4% Healthcare 41.6 3% Industrial 32.5   2% Total $ 1,651.8   100%     GEOGRAPHIC MIX           Outstanding Principal     % of Portfolio Mid-Atlantic/Northeast $ 347.5 21% Southwest 341.9 21% West 334.5 20% Midwest 317.5 19% Southeast 310.4   19% Total $ 1,651.8   100%       RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, INVESTMENT CAPACITY AND LIQUIDITY On July 12, 2017, we originated an $18.1 million senior mortgage loan on a multifamily property located in California. At closing, the outstanding principal balance was approximately $13.4 million. The loan has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 3.80% (plus fees) and an initial term of three years. On July 17, 2017, we originated a $39.7 million senior mortgage loan on a student housing property located in North Carolina. At closing, the outstanding principal balance was approximately $38.4 million. The loan has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 4.75% (plus fees) and an initial term of one and a half years. As of August 2, 2017, the Company had approximately $111 million in capital, either in cash or in undrawn capacity expected to be available under its secured funding agreements. After holding in reserve $10 million in liquidity requirements, the Company expects to have approximately $101 million in capital available to fund new loans, fund outstanding commitments on existing loans and for other working capital and general corporate purposes. Assuming that the Company uses all such amount as capital to make new senior loans and the Company is able to leverage such amount under its secured funding agreements at a debt-to-equity ratio of 2.5:1, the Company would have the capacity to fund approximately $350 million of additional senior loans. As of August 2, 2017, the total unfunded commitments for the Company’s existing loans held for investment were approximately $103 million. In addition, borrowings under the Company’s secured funding agreements were approximately $848 million, borrowings under the Company’s secured term loan was approximately $155 million and debt issued in the form of a collateralized loan obligation was approximately $273 million. On August 3, 2017, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.27 per common share for the third quarter of 2017. The third quarter 2017 dividend is payable on October 16, 2017 to common stockholders of record as of September 29, 2017. SECOND QUARTER 2017 DIVIDEND On May 2, 2017, the Company declared a cash dividend of $0.27 per common share for the second quarter of 2017. The second quarter 2017 dividend was paid on July 17, 2017 to common stockholders of record as of June 30, 2017.
