ABDC,"In May 2015, we reviewed business development companies (BDCs), publicly traded companies that have particularly high dividend yields — some of them higher than 10%. Now that interest rates have (apparently) bottomed out, it’s time to see how they’ve performed, and also to seek out others. Please see the previous article for a definition of BDCs. In short, they’re regulated investment companies that distribute most of their income as dividends. They generally make loans to small and medium-sized companies, and have been expanding their business in the post-financial-crisis environment, as banks have pulled back from such lending. And this means BDCs tend to have high dividend yields. In fact, among a list of 50 BDCs prepared by Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, 26 had dividend yields that topped 10% as of Sept. 23, while 41 had yields over 8%. We are going to share several lists of BDCs that you might consider for dividend income, but first we need to discuss the risks. Patience is required The price investors pay to receive the high dividends is volatility. In Keefe, Bruyette and Woods’ list, 49 were publicly traded through 2015, and 42 suffered prices declines for the year. “In late 2015, the bond market, particularly the high-yield bond market, really started trading down significantly,” said KBW analyst Ryan Lynch, who now covers BDCs for the firm, in an interview. “BDCs are basically portfolios of higher-yielding levered loans and bonds. So if you have a lot of choppiness or a downtrend in high-yield bonds or levered loans, that’s when BDCs will underperform.” An example of how difficult life can be in an illiquid market was provided by the demise of the Third Avenue Focused Credit, a high-yield bond fund that was forced to close and return investors’ money — or what was left of their money — as the fund sold its assets into a market that didn’t want them. This two-year chart for the Bloomberg Barclays U.S. Corporate High-Yield Index shows just how much price volatility we’re talking about: FactSet So you’ll need to be able to wait out downturns to (hopefully) continue receiving the dividends through thick and thin. How our first list performed In the previous BDC article in May 2015, we listed seven BDCs that were rated “outperform” by KBW analyst Troy Ward — who covered the industry for the firm at that time — along with Goldman Sachs BDC, which was relatively new. Here’s how the group has performed since May 13, 2015: Business development company Ticker Dividend yield - Sept. 23, 2016 Price change - May 13, 2015 - Sept. 23, 2016 Total return - May 13, 2015 - Sept. 23, 2016 Growth of book value per share - 12 months Apollo Investment Corp.

Then again, since BDCs are income vehicles, you probably wouldn’t be reinvesting the dividends. But you can see the effect of price volatility during a relatively short period for this type of investment. Ideally, you will choose BDCs with excellent underwriting, which means very low credit losses. Leaving aside the share-price fluctuation, you don’t want to see your book value declining very much as you receive the dividend income. “My opinion is if a BDC pays a 10% dividend, but their book value falls by 5%, I didn’t really get a 10% return. I got a 5% return that year,” Lynch said. He said that, since credit quality had been unusually solid for several years leading into 2015, credit deterioration over the past year and a half is partially “driven by a normalization of credit,” and partly driven by the decline in energy prices. Ways to differentiate BDCs The typical BDC is run by an outside manager that charges 1.5% to 2% a year, based on assets under management, for its services. On top of this, most of the outside managers charge additional fees ranging from 15% to 20% of the income generated. Some BDCs are internally managed, which can mean that the interests of the managers are better aligned with those of shareholders. “They don’t get paid on assets under management,” Lynch said, “so if an internally managed BDC is growing assets and raising equity capital, you do not have to worry about them expanding just to get paid more.” Manuel Henriquez, the founder and CEO of Hercules Capital Inc. HTGC, +0.67% said that the company, an internally managed BDC, along with its four major competitors don’t charge those extra fees. “We basically charge as if we were a typical corporation, so our salaries are fully transparent and are embedded in our proxy statements,” he said in an interview. Henriquez called his company “unique,” since it focuses on venture capital. Drug discovery and development, sustainable and renewable technology, software and drug delivery companies account for the biggest holdings, making up 63% of the BDC’s assets. Here are the five largest internally managed BDCs by market value, according to KBW and FactSet, excluding American Capital Ltd. US:ACAS which has a deal in place to be acquired by Ares Capital Corp.

There are no “sell” or equivalent ratings for the other four internally managed BDCs on this list. Keep in mind that the expectations for price increases over the next 12 months are just that — they do no reflect the dividends investors expect to receive. These forward price-to-earnings valuations may appear quite low, when compared with the S&P 500 SPX, +1.38%  which trades at a weighted 16.3 times consensus 2017 EPS estimates, according to FactSet. But S&P doesn’t include BDCs in its indices. Main Street Capital Corp. MAIN, +0.11% Hercules Capital Corp. HTGC, +0.67% and Triangle Capital Corp.

The most important thing is that a BDC’s management makes good loans and avoids taking losses. Industry trends, such as the decline in oil prices, can have a major effect on BDC share prices, even when the companies are not overly concentrated in the energy sector. It can take time for prices to recover, but if you are holding well-run BDCs, your income should continue to flow. Since BDCs do not report credit quality in a uniform fashion, as banks do, it isn’t always easy to understand how much risk is being taken. So you should discuss possible investment choices with your broker or investment adviser. Obtain research reports and read them, along with company filings, and decide whether you think a company’s long-term strategy will work. You might then enjoy years of high dividend income.

ABDC,"The seesawing stock market may finally prompt investors to dedicate more money toward high-dividend-paying companies, bonds and real estate investment trusts. After all, some form of income strategy is better for many long-term investors, even those who aren’t retired or close to retirement. There certainly is an urgency for safer investing, as there may be more trouble ahead for stocks. For one, companies have lowered earnings estimates for the second half of the year. And a range of other worries — China’s slowing economy, rising official interest rates by the Federal Reserve — are weighing on investors’ minds. On Wednesday, the S&P 500 Index SPX, +1.38%  rallied 3.9%, the biggest gain in four years, putting an end to an 11% decline in the six days through Tuesday. Stocks rose again in early trading Thursday. Among the benchmark S&P 500, 486 companies had reported earnings results for the most recent quarter (through Tuesday). While many sectors posted impressive earnings-per-share growth, most are lower than they were a year earlier. And the pace of profit growth for the second half of the year may slow considerably, based on companies’ lowering of guidance. Here are the S&P 500’s 10 sectors sorted by EPS growth rates for the most recent quarter: S&P 500 sector Second-quarter EPS growth rate Year-earlier EPS growth rate Health Care 14.70% 16.95% Telecommunication Services 11.84% 30.32% Consumer Discretionary 10.67% 10.55% Financials 9.64% -0.49% Materials 7.76% 15.80% Information Technology 6.09% 10.86% Utilities 4.45% 3.51% Consumer Staples 1.44% 7.61% Industrials -0.17% 13.25% Energy -55.76% 16.60% S&P 500 0.10% 10.49% Source: S&P Capital IQ The energy sector is dragging down the index, and seven of 10 sectors are showing slower EPS growth. How much have you been affected by the equity market turmoil over the past week? For many long-term investors, it hasn’t really been a problem because they expect history to repeat itself with a recovery for stocks. Or they may rest easy because they know that during a down market, contributions to 401(k) or similar retirement plans that are invested in stock mutual funds will be going in at lower prices. That can be a very good thing if you have an investment horizon that stretches for decades. But do you worry every day? If so, maybe you should focus some or even most of your investment efforts on income rather than growth. A constant stream of investment income can make it much easier to sleep at night. With enough income, you can fund new investments to generate even more income and grow your pot of gold in a lower-risk way than you would with a stock portfolio. Your returns over long periods are likely to be lower, but you may rest easier. The income approach may not be for everyone. Most long-term investors are likely to be better off in broad index funds, assuming that events such as those we have seen over the past week will not cause them to sell in a down market. Even with an income approach, there will still be volatility. If you invest in a bond fund, you might get a decent yield and enjoy the monthly dividend payments, but you will also be dealing with fluctuating share prices. Market prices for bonds decline when interest rates rise, and short-term rates in the U.S. have been near zero since late 2008. The Federal Reserve is expected to begin raising short-term rates this year. While we cannot say how rapidly long-term interest rates will rise, it does seem that prices for long-term bond funds will be declining. And there’s no guarantee that your losses in a bond fund will be made up when rates fall again. You can focus on bond funds with shorter durations (and lower yields) to limit volatility risk. Then, if you are willing to take more credit risk, you can consider high-yield, or non-investment-grade (“junk”) bond funds. One example in that category is the RiverPark Strategic Income Fund RSIVX, -0.32% which we reviewed in July.  But there’s more you can do to worry less about volatility. Hold your own paper If you own your own bonds, you can avoid the daily stress of fluctuating share prices — and also mutual fund management fees. That assumes the bonds don’t default, of course. If a bond was issued when interest rates were higher than they are now, you may be paying a premium to buy it, which will lower your yield to maturity. Your broker can help you make the appropriate calculations to make a decision. For example, if a bond with a face value of $10,000 is trading at a 5% premium, you will pay $10,500 for the bond and only receive $10,000 when the bond matures. You might find that the yield is high enough to make it worth taking that loss. You might also be able to buy newly issued bonds at par value through your broker. Whether you pay par, a premium or a discounted price, you will eventually be repaid the face value, no matter how much the market value of the security fluctuates each day. By holding the bond until maturity, you will not be tempted or burdened by daily price quotes. Depending on your marginal tax rate and how high your state income taxes are, you may also find municipal bonds worth a look, since they are exempt from federal income taxes and from state and local taxes, if the bond was issued in your state. Of course, bond rates are pretty low. The yield to maturity for the Bank of America Merrill Lynch U.S. Corporate Bond Index is 3.45%. With bond rates so low for so long, you might need to be more aggressive when considering higher-yielding asset classes. Preferred stock Preferred stocks are different from common stocks in that shareholders have no voting rights. But preferred stocks have a stated dividend rate, with a par value, just like bonds. Many also have call dates. A call date is similar to a maturity date, except that the issuer has the option of buying back the stock at that time. Just as you would for a bond, you need to calculate the market yield for a preferred stock you are considering. For example, J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. JPM, +1.82%  non-cumulative perpetual preferred series Y shares trade under the ticker JPM-F, have a $25 par value, a dividend rate of 6.13% and a call date of March 2, 2020. The shares traded for a discount, having closed at $24.84 on Tuesday. Non-cumulative means if the company suspends the dividend, and then resumes paying, it will not have to make up any dividend payments that were missed. The annual dividend payments on this preferred stock total $1.53125 a share, so the current yield, based on Tuesday’s closing price, is 6.16%. The yield to call, which reflects the current discount and the fact that you will be paid the face value of the shares if the company redeems the stock, is 6.29%. When you buy preferred shares in the open market, you pay a commission to your broker (which you might be able to negotiate lower, if you have a full-service broker), and pay a premium or get the shares for a discount. But you may also have the opportunity to buy newly issued preferred shares “off the shelf,” with no commission, if your broker participates in the underwriting. Talk to your broker. QuantumOnline is an excellent source for lists of preferred stocks. (Please read on for a discussion of three other classes of income securities.)

ABDC,"Have you suffered from a drop in investment income because of perennially low interest rates? If so, you might want to consider buying shares of a business-development company, provided that you do the extra research needed to understand the risks and rewards. Business-development companies, or BDCs, have been around for several decades, but changes in bank regulations following the credit crisis of 2008 have made the investing vehicle more popular. BDCs have tax advantages because they are required to pass at least 90% of their earnings through to shareholders. They also feature high dividend yields, as you will see below. Lending where banks can no longer tread A BDC typically focuses on making or participating in loans that aren’t backed by real estate or other assets to middle-market companies, although they can also make equity investments. Banks have been discouraged by federal regulators from making highly leveraged loans. While the rules aren’t hard and fast, regulators prefer banks not to make loans for more than about four times a company’s earnings before interest, depreciation, taxes and amortization (EBITDA). Business-development companies aren’t subject to any leveraged-lending restriction. That means the BDCs can make commercial and industrial loans to middle-market borrowers — typically those with between $10 million and $75 million in annual EBITDA — with much higher interest rates than banks can. The BDCs can charge high rates because the borrowers may not have other access to large amounts of credit, and the BDCs will charge premiums because the loans are illiquid. For larger deals, a BDC will typically provide only some of the financing at a higher interest rate than other participating lenders taking take senior-lien positions. While the BDCs are taking a growing share of a lending market traditionally dominated by banks, they don’t gather deposits as banks do. That could raise a red flag with some investors who fear a liquidity crisis similar to that of 2008. But the liquidity risk is mitigated by regulations requiring BDCs to have a ratio of assets to debt of at least 200%. In other words, a BDC’s borrowing is limited to one dollar for each dollar of equity. In comparison, a bank with a solid Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of 12% would be leveraged more than eight times. “Not one BDC has ever gone bankrupt. At any time, they can fully pay off their creditors. They were never forced to sell assets at a discount,” during the 2008-2009 credit crisis, according to Troy Ward, a managing director covering specialty finance for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. And the BDCs also lower their interest-rate risk by focusing on making loans with variable rates. For example, Goldman Sachs BDC Inc. GSBD, +0.58%  said 84.9% of its total investment portfolio was in floating-rate instruments as of March 31. This BDC completed an initial public offering in March. Some BDCs are not publicly listed, and are offered to higher net worth investors through brokers. We’re focusing here on publicly traded BDCs. Feast your eyes on high yields Ward covers 26 BDCs and has “outperform” ratings on seven of them. Here they are, along with the Goldman Sachs BDC listed above (which is not yet covered by KBW), ordered by declining dividend yield: Business- Development Company Ticker Closing price - May 13 Dividend per share Dividend frequency Annual yield Apollo Investment Corp.

For example, we excluded the supplemental dividend of 5 cents a share declared by Triangle Capital Corp. TCAP, +0.36%  for the first quarter. ‘At the end of the day, the BDCs are not interest rate plays. They are credit plays.’ KBW analyst Troy Ward Interest-rate risk and credit risk Most investors realize that when interest rates rise, the value of income-producing assets generally falls. This is one reason five of the BDCs listed above are trading below book value. According to one BDC executive, the low market valuations also reflect some investors’ discomfort over the way BDCs pay their managers. Fees and incentive bonuses tend to be based on income being earned by the BDC, which means the managers might be receiving high bonuses even if the BDC stocks are falling. But a significant rise in interest rates will be unlikely to threaten your BDC investment income, since the majority of the companies’ assets feature variable interest rates. So even though you can expect some price declines when the Federal Reserve finally begins raising the short-term federal funds rate from its current range of zero to 0.25%, you will continue to enjoy the same high yield on whatever you invest before the rates go up. During a telephone interview on Thursday, Keefe, Bruyette & Woods’ Ward stressed that “at the end of the day, the BDCs are not interest-rate plays. They are credit plays.” But what does that mean? It means that unless you are patient and committed, you should consider lightening up on BDC holdings if you are convinced the economy is heading into a recession. That seems unlikely over the next few years, especially with the Federal Reserve ready to raise interest rates, which would be a firm signal of confidence that the U.S. economic recovery will continue. And Ward doesn’t expect to see massive declines in value for BDCs as rates rise. “BDCs don’t trade by the spread over Treasury rates,” he said. Another interesting point to consider is that even though BDCs recorded massive markdowns on loans during and after the credit crisis, most of those paper losses were recovered. The group’s total loan-loss rates, factoring in long-term market recoveries, ranged from 2.1% to a net value increase of 0.8%. That’s according to a KBW analysis of 16 BDCs from June 30, 2006, or from their IPO dates as late as October 2007. So the BDCs measured up well for long-term investors who stayed the course and enjoyed high yields through the credit crisis.

State Street Bank and Trust Company (""State Street"") provides us with financial reporting, post-trade compliance, and treasury services. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, Alcentra has elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (""RIC""), commencing with its tax year ending December 31, 2014, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue. BNY Mellon-Alcentra Mezzanine III, L.P. (the ""Partnership"" or ""Fund III"") is a Delaware limited partnership, which commenced operations on May 14, 2010. The Partnership was formed for the purpose of seeking current income and long-term capital appreciation by making investments in senior debt securities, mezzanine debt securities, and common and preferred equity securities with equity rights or participations in U.S.-based middle market companies. BNY Mellon-Alcentra Mezzanine III (GP), L.P. (the ""General Partner""), a Delaware limited liability company, is the General Partner of the Partnership. BNY Mellon-Alcentra Mezzanine Partners (the ""Manager""), a division of Alcentra NY, LLC (""Alcentra Group"") and an affiliate of the General Partner, manages the investment activities of the Partnership. Alcentra NY, LLC is a majority-owned, indirect subsidiary of The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. On May 14, 2014, Alcentra completed its initial public offering (the ""Offering""), at a price of $15.00 per share. Through its initial public offering the Company sold 6,666,666 shares for gross proceeds of approximately $100,000,000. On June 6, 2014, Alcentra sold 750,000 shares through the underwriters' exercise of the overallotment option for gross proceeds of $11,250,000. Immediately prior to the Offering, Fund III sold all of its assets other than its investment in the shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock of GTT Communications (the ""Fund III Acquired Assets"") to the Company for $64.4 million in cash and $91.5 million in shares of the Company's common stock. Concurrent with the acquisition of the Fund III Acquired Assets from Fund III, the Company also purchased for $29 million in cash certain additional investments (the ""Warehouse Portfolio"") from Alcentra Group. The Warehouse Portfolio consisted of approximately $29 million in debt investments originated by the investment professionals of the Manager and purchased by Alcentra Group using funds under a warehouse credit facility provided by The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in anticipation of the Offering. The Company entered into a senior secured term loan agreement (the ""Bridge Facility"") with ING Capital LLC as lender that it used to fund the purchase of the Warehouse Portfolio and to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to Fund III. In May 2014, the Company used $94.2 million of the proceeds from the Offering to repay the Bridge Facility in full. The Company's investment objective is to generate primarily current income and, to a lesser extent, capital appreciation through debt and equity investments, respectively by targeting investments in lower middle and middle-market companies (typically those with $5.0 million to up to $75 million of EBITDA) through first lien, second lien, unitranche and, to a lesser extent given the current credit environment, mezzanine debt and equity investments. The Company is required to comply with certain regulatory requirements such as not acquiring any assets other than ""qualifying assets"" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include investments in ""eligible portfolio companies."" Under the relevant SEC rules, the term ""eligible portfolio company"" includes all private  TABLE OF CONTENTS at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $11.5 million and $9.9 million, respectively, and our largest portfolio company investment by amortized cost and fair value was approximately $23.3 million and $23.3 million, respectively. When comparing these December 31, 2017 statistics to the comparative period, our first lien debt, which is secured by collateral has increased, from 34.6% to 61.7% in accordance with the expanded investment strategy noted above. As of December 31, 2016, we had $276.3 million (at fair value) invested in 32 portfolio companies. Our portfolio included approximately 34.6% of first lien debt, 30.7% of second lien debt, 26.8% of mezzanine debt and 7.8% of equity investments at fair value. At December 31, 2016, our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $8.8 million and $8.4 million, respectively, and our largest portfolio company investment by amortized cost and fair value was approximately $15.1 million and $15.1 million, respectively. At December 31, 2017, 53.5% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 46.5% bore interest at fixed rates. At December 31, 2016, 58.4% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 41.6% bore interest at fixed rates. The weighted average yield on all of our debt investments as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was approximately 11.3% and 11.7%, respectively. The drop in weighted average yield is a function of several factors including the rotation to more senior secured floating rate debt investments, the conversion of certain debt instruments to equity, the repayment of certain higher yielding junior securities and redeployment into lower yielding assets in response to market conditions. The weighted average yield was computed using the effective interest rates for all of our debt investments, including accretion of original issue discount but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries' fees and expenses. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level. Our investment portfolio may contain loans that are in the form of lines of credit or revolving credit facilities, which require us to provide funding when requested by portfolio companies in accordance with the terms of the underlying loan agreements. As of December 31, 2017 we had 6 such investments with an aggregate unfunded commitment of $17.2 million and at December 31, 2016 we had 4 such investments with an aggregate unfunded commitment of $6.3 million. The increase is a result of private equity sponsor ""buy and build strategies"" where we fund alongside of the private equity sponsor small tuck-in or other accretive acquisitions to help build scale, diversity products, increase customers or expand geographies of these portfolio companies.

The following analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto contained in this quarterly report on Form 10-Q. Overview Alcentra Capital Corporation (""we"", ""us"" or ""our"") was formed as a Maryland corporation on June 6, 2013 as an externally managed, non-diversified closed-end management investment company that has elected to be regulated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the ""1940 Act""). We are managed by Alcentra NY, LLC (the ""Adviser"", or ""Alcentra NY""), a registered investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the ""Advisers Act""). State Street Bank and Trust Company (""State Street"") provides us with financial reporting, post-trade compliance, and treasury services. In addition, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we have elected to be treated as a regulated investment company (""RIC""), commencing with tax year ended December 31, 2014, under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the ""Code""). BNY Mellon-Alcentra Mezzanine III, L.P. (the ""Partnership"" or ""Fund III"") is a Delaware limited partnership, which commenced operations on May 14, 2010. The Partnership was formed for the purpose of seeking current income and long-term capital appreciation by making investments in senior debt securities, subordinated debt securities, and common and preferred equity securities with equity rights or participations in U.S.-based middle market companies. BNY Mellon-Alcentra Mezzanine III (GP), L.P. (the ""General Partner""), a Delaware limited liability company, is the General Partner of the Partnership. BNY Mellon-Alcentra Mezzanine Partners (the ""Manager""), a division of Alcentra NY, LLC (""Alcentra Group"") and an affiliate of the General Partner, manages the investment activities of the Partnership. Alcentra NY, LLC is wholly owned by BNY Alcentra Group Holdings, Inc. which is wholly owned by The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation. On May 14, 2014, Alcentra completed its initial public offering (the ""Offering""), at a price of $15.00 per share. Through its initial public offering the Company sold 6,666,666 shares for gross proceeds of approximately $100,000,000. On June 6, 2014, Alcentra sold 750,000 shares through the underwriters' exercise of the overallotment option for gross proceeds of $11,250,000. Immediately prior to the Offering, Fund III sold all of its assets other than its investment in the shares of common stock and warrants to purchase common stock of GTT Communications (the ""Fund III Acquired Assets"") to the Company for $64.4 million in cash and $91.5 million in shares of the Company's common stock. Concurrent with the acquisition of the Fund III Acquired Assets from Fund III, the Company also purchased for $29 million in cash certain additional investments (the ""Warehouse Portfolio"") from Alcentra Group. The Warehouse Portfolio consisted of approximately $29 million in debt investments originated by the investment professionals of the Manager and purchased by Alcentra Group using funds under a warehouse credit facility provided by The Bank of New York Mellon Corporation in anticipation of the Offering. The Company entered into a senior secured term loan agreement (the ""Bridge Facility"") with ING Capital LLC as lender that it used to fund the purchase of the Warehouse Portfolio and to fund the cash portion of the consideration paid to Fund III. In May 2014, the Company used $94.2 million of the proceeds from the Offering to repay the Bridge Facility in full. On May 22, 2017 Alcentra Capital Corporation completed an underwritten primary offering of 808,161 shares of its common stock at a public offering price of $13.68 per share for proceeds of approximately $10.6 million after deducting sales load and offering expenses. Our investment objective is to generate both current income and capital appreciation through debt and equity investments by targeting investment opportunities with favorable risk-adjusted returns. The Company invests primarily in middle-market companies in the form of mezzanine and senior secured loans, each of which may include an equity component, and, to a lesser extent, by making direct equity investments in such companies. We are required to comply with certain regulatory requirements such as not acquiring any assets other than ""qualifying assets"" specified in the 1940 Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of our total assets are qualifying assets. Qualifying assets include investments in ""eligible portfolio companies."" Under the relevant SEC rules, the term ""eligible portfolio company"" includes all private operating companies, operating companies whose securities are not listed on a national securities exchange, and certain public operating companies that have listed their securities on a national securities exchange and have a market capitalization of less than $250 million, in each case organized and with their principal of business in the United States. Portfolio Composition and Investment Activity Portfolio Composition We originate and invest primarily in middle-market companies (typically those with $5.0 million to $25.0 million of EBITDA and/or revenues between $10 million and $250 million) through first lien, second lien, unitranche and mezzanine debt financing, often times with a corresponding equity investment. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we invested $28.1 million in debt and equity investments including one new portfolio investment and three add on investments. These investments consisted of senior secured loans ($26.2 million, or 93.2% of the total amount invested) and equity securities ($1.9 million, or 6.8% of the total amount invested). During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we received proceeds from sales or repayments, including principal, return of capital dividends and realized gains, of $3.9 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, we invested $51.8 million in debt and equity investments in three new portfolio companies and two add on investments. These investments consisted of senior secured loans ($18.0 million, or 34.7%), second lien notes ($3.1 million, or 6.0%), subordinated notes ($29.7 million, or 57.3%), and equity securities ($1.0 million, or 1.9%). During the three months ended September 30, 2016 we received proceeds from sales or repayments, including principal, return of capital dividends and realized gains, of $30.1 million. As of September 30, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $282.3 million and consisted of 30 portfolio companies. As of September 30, 2017, 58 % of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 42% bore interest at fixed rates. Our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $10.4 million and $9.4 million, respectively, and our largest portfolio company investment by amortized cost and fair value was approximately $23.2 million and $23.2 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2016, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $276.3 million and consisted of 32 portfolio companies. As of December 31, 2016, 58.4% of our debt investments bore interest based on floating rates (subject to interest rate floors), such as LIBOR, and 41.6% bore interest at fixed rates. Our average portfolio company investment at amortized cost and fair value was approximately $8.8 million and $8.4million, respectively, and our largest portfolio company investment by amortized cost and fair value was approximately $15.1 million and $15.1 million, respectively. The weighted average yield on debt investments as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was 11.5% and 11.7%, respectively. The weighted average yields were computed using the effective interest rates for debt investments at cost as of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, including the accretion of original issue discount but excluding investments on non-accrual status, if any. The weighted average yield of our debt investments is not the same as a return on investment for our stockholders but, rather, relates to a portion of our investment portfolio and is calculated before the payment of all of our and our subsidiaries' fees and expenses. There can be no assurance that the weighted average yield will remain at its current level.

As of September 30, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we had three loans and one loan on non-accrual status. Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations Comparison of three months ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 Investment Income For the three months ended September 30, 2017, total investment income was $7.6 million, a decrease of $1.5 million, or 16.5% over the $9.1 million of total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to the conversion to equity from its debt investment in My Alarm Center, LLC and the addition of GST Autoleather and Media Storm LLC to non accrual status. There was also a shift in timing of the closing of new deals and the receipt of interest payments on those deals. We generate revenue in the form of interest income on debt investments and capital gains and distributions, if any, on investment securities that we may acquire in portfolio companies. Our debt investments typically have a term of five to seven years and bear interest at a fixed or floating rate. Interest on our debt securities is payable both quarterly and monthly. Payments of principal on our debt investments may be amortized over the stated term of the investment, deferred for several years or due entirely at maturity. In some cases, our debt investments may pay interest in-kind, or PIK. Any outstanding principal amount of our debt securities and any accrued but unpaid interest will generally become due at the maturity date. The level of interest income we receive is directly related to the balance of interest-bearing investments multiplied by the weighted average yield of our investments. We expect that the total dollar amount of interest and any dividend income that we earn to increase as the size of our investment portfolio increases. In addition, we may generate revenue in the form of prepayment fees, commitment, loan origination, structuring or due diligence fees, fees for providing significant managerial assistance and consulting fees. Expenses For the three months ended September 30, 2017, total expenses were $3.9 million, which was a decrease of $0.4 million, or 9.2%, from the $4.3 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016 primarily as a result of a decrease in management and incentive fees. Interest and financing expenses for the three months ended September 30, 2017 were $1.8 million, which is relatively flat from September 30, 2016. This is largely due to the decreased borrowing during the quarter offset by the rise in LIBOR in 2017. The base management fee decreased by $0.1 million, or 7.8%, to $1.2 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 due to slightly lower average total assets less cash and cash equivalents than the comparable period in 2016. $1.1 million of management fees were also waived for the three months ended September 30,2017. The incentive fee for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $0.0, as compared to $0.6 million from the comparable period in 2016. The administrative service fee, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses totaled $0.8 million for the three months ended September 30, 2017 compared to a total of $0.5 million for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This increase is the result of an increase in reimbursable expenses to the Adviser, the addition of one director to the board and an overage on audit expenses. Net Investment Income Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $ 4.8 million, which is flat from the the three months ended September 30, 2016 after a management fee waiver of $1.2 million. Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting From Operations For the three months ended September 30, 2017, the net realized loss from portfolio investments was $10.4 million due to the restructuring of My Alarm Center, LLC and for the three months ended September 30, 2016, realized gains were $8.8 million primarily from the sale of DBI Holdings, Inc. During the three months ended September 30, 2017, we recorded a net change in unrealized depreciation from portfolio investments of $1.3 million due largely to the $10.4 million that was attributable to the reversal of the net unrealized depreciation on My Alarm Center, LLC, the write down of GST Autoleather by $8.5 million and $3.2 million of net additional write downs. During the three months ended September 30, 2016, the net change in unrealized depreciation was $19.0 million. As a result of these events, our net decrease in net assets resulting from operations during the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $1.6 million, a decrease of $0.2 million compared to a net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of $1.8 million during the three months ended September 30, 2016. Provision for Taxes on Unrealized Appreciation on Investments We have a direct wholly owned subsidiary that has elected to be a taxable entity (the ""Taxable Subsidiary""). The Taxable Subsidiary permits us to hold equity investments in portfolio companies which are ""pass through"" entities for tax purposes and continue to comply with the ""source income"" requirements contained in RIC tax provisions of the Code. The Taxable Subsidiary is not consolidated with us for income tax purposes and may generate income tax expense, benefit, and the related tax assets and liabilities, as a result of its ownership of certain portfolio investments. The income tax expense, or benefit, if any, and related tax assets and liabilities are reflected in our consolidated financial statements. For the three months ended September 30, 2017, we recognized a provision for income tax on unrealized gains on investments of $5.3 million. Comparison of nine months ended September 30, 2017 and September 30, 2016 Investment Income For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, total investment income was $25.2 million, a decrease of $4.5 million, or 15.3%, over the $29.7 million of total investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The decrease was primarily attributable to a slower pace of deployment as compared to repayments, a decrease of $1.7 million in fee income and the conversion of My Alarm Center, LLC to equity and the addition of GST Autoleather to non accruals status. Expenses For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, total expenses were $10.9 million after the waiver of management fees, a decrease of $2.5 million or 19.0%, over the $13.4 million of total expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Interest and financing expenses for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 were $5.4 million, an increase of $0.4 million or 8.6%, compared to $5.0 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 as a result of the rise in LIBOR as well as the additional full nine month accrual of interest payable on the the issuance of $5 million of Notes. The base management fee decreased $0.2 million, or 5.1%, to $3.7 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 due to slightly lower average total assets less cash and cash equivalents than the comparable period in 2016. The incentive fee for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $0.6 million, a $1.7 million, or 72.5%, decrease from the $2.3 million incentive fee for the nine months ended September 30, 2016 which was the result of lower net investment income earned during the third quarter of 2017; therefore the incentive fee was not earned. The administrative service fee, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses totaled $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to $2.1 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. Net Investment Income Net investment income for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $14.3 million, which was a decrease of $2.0 million, or 12.3%, compared to net investment income of $16.3 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This is due to the decrease in investment income and lower net expenses, inclusive of the waiver of management fees. Net Increase in Net Assets Resulting From Operations For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, the total net realized losses on investments were $11.4 million, due largely to My Alarm Center, LLC. The net change in unrealized depreciation on investments for the nine months ended September 30, 2017 was $13.0 million attributable mainly to the write down on GST Autoleather and Southern Technical Institute, Inc. During the nine months ended September 30, 2016, the net change in unrealized depreciation on investments was $13.0 million attributable to (i) the net unrealized loss on exits, repayments or sale of investments $2.1 (ii) a write down of various other portfolio companies of $2.9 million and (iii) the unrealized depreciation of $12.0 million on other securities as well as a weather related portfolio company. Liquidity and Capital Resources As of September 30, 2017, there was $4.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and net assets totaled $174.8 million. We believe that our current cash and cash equivalents on hand, our credit facility and our anticipated cash flows from operations will provide adequate capital resources with which to operate and finance our investment business and make distributions to our stockholders for at least the next 12 months. We intend to generate additional cash primarily from future debt offerings and future borrowings, as well as cash flows from operations, including income earned from investments in our portfolio companies. On both a short-term and long-term basis, our primary use of funds will be investments in portfolio companies and cash distributions to our stockholders. Cash Flows For the nine months ended September 30, 2017, we experienced a net increase in cash and cash equivalents in the amount of $1.0 million. During that period, we used $15.6 million in cash from operating activities, primarily due to the purchase of portfolio investments of approximately $96.9 million. This was partially offset by proceeds from the return of capital of portfolio investments of approximately $70.8 million. This was also offset by $13.0 million of change in depreciation of investments and a decrease of $2.5 million in interest and . . . Nov 07, 2017 (c) 1995-2017 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

ABDC,"NEW YORK, March 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Alcentra Capital Corporation ABDC, -1.00% (""Alcentra"" or the ""Company""), a provider of customized debt and equity financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market and middle-market companies based in the United States, today announced its financial results for the fourth quarter and full year of 2017. Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Summary Total investment income of $8.2 million Net investment income of $4.0 million, or $0.28 per share based on weighted average shares of common stock outstanding Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of ($13.4) million Invested $36.8 million in debt securities; one new investment, one refinancing and one add on investment Received proceeds from repayments of $15.7 million Paid quarterly dividend for the Q4 2017 of $0.25 per share on January 4, 2018 On November 16, 2017, the Board of Directors expanded the open market stock repurchase program by $2.5 million to $5.0 million. Net asset value of $157.7 million, or $11.09 per share, which is down from $12.27 in the third quarter of 2017 Weighted Average Debt Portfolio Yield – 11.3% Full Year 2017 Financial Summary Total investment income of $33.4 million Net Investment income of $18.3 million, or $1.32 per share Net decrease in net assets resulting from operations of ($19.1) million Invested $135.5 million in debt and equity securities, including investments in 4 new portfolio companies Received proceeds from repayments of $90.1 million Paid dividends totaling $1.30 per share (inclusive of $0.03 special dividend) First Quarter 2018 Dividend On March 8, 2018, the Company's Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $0.18 per share for the first quarter of 2018, which is payable on April 4, 2018 to stockholders of record as of March 30, 2018. Management Commentary On March 8, 2018, the Board of Directors reduced the first quarter 2018 quarterly dividend to $0.18 per share. David Scopelliti, the Company's CEO, stated, ""The board's view on the dividend policy is to make distributions to shareholders in line with the earnings potential of the portfolio. The market environment and yield profile has changed since the initial dividend rate of $0.34 per share was established following our IPO in May 2014. Contributing to the dividend reduction this quarter was (i) lower earnings associated with the portfolio of high yielding unsecured subordinated debt (ii) further credit markdowns in Q4 2017, (iii) ongoing repayments of high coupon performing loans, (iv) rotation to senior secured loans, which have lower pricing than the subordinated debt portfolio and (v) overall private credit market yield compression. Given that we believe we are in the late stages of the credit cycle, we are pursuing a portfolio construction with more senior secured debt to reduce risk of principal loss or impairment.  This strategy will allow us to generate income without reducing the quality of new investments by reaching for yield. Mr. Scopelliti further stated, ""We continue to be committed to creating shareholder value through share repurchases and aligning the dividend with the current earnings power of the portfolio."" Fourth Quarter 2017 Financial Results For the three months ended December 31, 2017, total investment income was $8.2 million, a decrease of $2.7 million over the $10.9 million of total investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to the conversion of Conisus debt to equity, the addition of Southern Technical Institute to non-accrual status, the further write down of Media Storm along with a shift in timing of the closing of new deals. Interest and PIK income comprised $6.2 million and $1.3 million, respectively and other income was $0.7 million. Net investment income for the three months ended December 31, 2017 was $4.0 million ($0.28 per share based on average shares outstanding of 14.2 million). For the three months ended December 31, 2017, net expenses were $4.2 million, a decrease of $0.6 million from the $4.8 million of net expenses for the three months ended December 31, 2016. This decrease is due largely to the decrease in earned incentive fees. Interest and financing expenses for the quarter was $2.1 million and the base management fee was $1.3 million. Professional fees and other general and administrative expenses totaled $0.8 million for the three months ended December 31, 2017. During the quarter, we also recorded a net change in unrealized depreciation from portfolio investments of $15.6 million attributable largely to unrealized depreciation of our debt investments in Southern Technical Institute, Media Storm and Conisus.   The net decrease in net assets resulting from operations post benefit for taxes during the three months ended December 31, 2017 was ($13.4) million. Portfolio and Investment Activities As of December 31, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $287.6 million and consisted of 29 portfolio companies. The average portfolio investment at amortized cost was $11.5 million and equity constituted 10.1% of the fair value of the portfolio.  During the fourth quarter, we invested $36.8 million in debt and equity investments, including one new investment and two add-on investments and received proceeds from repayments on investments of $15.7 million. As of December 31, 2017, the weighted average yield on debt investments was 11.3%.

ABDC,"NEW YORK, Nov. 6, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alcentra Capital Corporation ABDC, -1.00% (""Alcentra"" or the ""Company""), a provider of customized debt and equity financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market companies based in the United States, today announced its financial results for the third quarter of 2017. Third Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Total investment income of $7.6 million Net investment income of $4.8 million, or $0.34 per share based on weighted average shares of common stock outstanding, after management fee waivers of $1.2 million Invested $28.1 million in debt and equity securities, inclusive of three add-on investments Received proceeds from repayments of $3.9 million Paid regular quarterly dividend for the third quarter of 2017 of $0.34 per share on October 5, 2017 The Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.25 per share for the fourth quarter of 2017, which is payable on January 4, 2018 to stockholders of record as of December 29, 2017 The Company's Board of Directors approved a $2.5 million open market stock repurchase program. The program is authorized through November 2, 2018 Net asset value of $174.8 million, or $12.27 per share, which is down from $12.73 in the second quarter of 2017 Weighted Average Portfolio Company Leverage – 3.59x Weighted Average Debt Portfolio Yield – 11.5% Management Commentary ""During the quarter we led an investment in Carlton Group, a provider of turnkey solutions addressing employee incentives/rewards program administration which was acquired by HIG Growth Fund.  Subsequent to September 30, 2017 we led an acquisition financing for Cirrus, a specialized healthcare staffing company that was acquired by Webster Capital."" On November 2, 2017, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.25 per share for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017, which is payable on January 4, 2018.  David Scopelliti, the Company's CEO and CIO, stated, ""The board's view on the dividend policy is to make distributions to shareholders in line with the earnings potential of the portfolio. The market environment has changed since the initial dividend rate of $0.34 per share following our IPO in May 2014. While it is still possible to find high yielding investments, we believe a single strategy of pursuing higher-yielding junior unsecured debt comes with a greater risk of principal loss or impairment in the current market environment.  While we will not abandon making junior capital investments we will continue to expand the senior and unitranche component of our portfolio in order to diversify and mitigate portfolio risk."" Ellida McMillan, the Company's CFO and COO, commented that, ""Although the earnings capability of the portfolio has been reduced due to recent performance of certain credits, the strategy going forward will allow us to generate income without reducing the quality of our portfolio or reaching for yield. Our adviser, Alcentra NY LLC, has waived $1.3 million of its management fees this fiscal year to-date to meet the $0.34/share dividend to our shareholders for the past two quarters."" Mr. Scopelliti further stated, ""The board and executive management team are committed to creating long-term shareholder value and believe that aligning the distribution with earnings power of the portfolio will provide our shareholders with more stable and consistent returns over the long-term."" Third Quarter 2017 Financial Results For the three months ended September 30, 2017, total investment income was $7.6 million, a decrease of $1.5 million over the $9.1 million of total investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to the conversion of My Alarm Center, LLC to equity and the addition of GST AutoLeather Inc. and Media Storm, LLC to non-accrual status, along with a shift in timing of the closing of new deals. Interest and PIK income comprised $7.2 million and other income was $0.4 million. Net investment income for the three months ended September 30, 2017 was $4.8 million ($0.34 per share which is based on average shares outstanding of 14.2 million) and after a management fee waiver of $1.2 million.

ABDC,"Sep 06, 2017 (ACCESSWIRE via COMTEX) -- DALLAS, TX / ACCESSWIRE / September 6, 2017 / Stonegate Capital Partners initiates coverage on Alcentra Capital Corporation ABDC, -1.00% : COMPANY DESCRIPTION Alcentra Capital Corporation is a Business Development Company (BDC) specializing in investments in lower middle-market growth companies. The Company invests in the form of senior secured debt, second lien debt, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, minority equity investments. The Company is externally managed and offers debt and equity funding solutions to North American lower middle-market growth companies. Its investment advisor, Alcentra NY, LLC is a credit-focused investment boutique with a primary focus in sub-investment grade credits. Alcentra Ltd., the parent company of Alcentra NY, LLC, is a subsidiary of BNY Mellon. SUMMARY Alcentra Capital is externally managed by Alcentra NY LLC, whose investment professionals possess collective experience of more than 60 years of investing and lending to middle-market companies across various economic cycles of the market. Alcentra's investment strategy focuses on lower middle-market growth company investments. Capitalizing on this often neglected market is a central strategic principle for the Company. Banks have been vacating the lower middle-market space for several years providing Alcentra ample opportunity to expand its portfolio. Alcentra Capital Corporation offers debt and equity investments to companies with annual EBITDA of $5M to $25M and/or revenues in the $10M to $250M range. Alcentra's usual investment size is typically in the $5M to $15M range. Investments take the form of senior debt, unitranche, second lien, subordinated debt and, to a lesser extent, minority equity investments. Alcentra's point of differentiation is the fact that it focuses on growth companies, which Alcentra defines as companies that traditionally have revenues between $10M and $100M and the potential to grow at 2x or 3x the US GDP growth rate. The Company's portfolio is well diversified with 30 companies representing 20 industry sectors. Healthcare Services is the single largest industry sector exposure, representing ~17% of the portfolio. Exposure to the oil & gas industry was limited to approximately 3.8% as of June 30, 2017. All portfolio companies are selected through a detailed screening process, comprised of a credit analysis, review of historical and projected financial performance, and an evaluation of business models. Alcentra has an advantage over other BDC's in terms of deal-flow because of the Company's investment advisor and its connection to BNY Mellon's Wealth Management group. Alcentra's investment advisor has developed a strong and wide reaching relationship network that provides a consistent influx of deal-flow. Alcentra is able to benefit from BNY Mellon's Wealth Management group, which upholds close associations with many owners of privately held businesses in the form of their high net-worth clientele. Since Alcentra's May 2014 IPO, the Company has not had any portfolio companies on non-accrual status until recently; as of 6/30/17, Alcentra reported two investments on non-accrual basis. We employ a scenario analysis using relative valuation frameworks with details on page 7 of the report. Currently, Alcentra is trading at a P/NAV of 0.84x vs. comps trading at a median P/NAV of 0.89x. Alcentra is trading at essentially the same multiple, while its dividend yield is 12.7% vs. the median of its peers of 9.1%. Using a P/NAV range of .95x to 1.05x, we arrive at a valuation range of $12.09 to $13.36, with a midpoint at $12.73.

ABDC,"NEW YORK, Aug. 3, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Alcentra Capital Corporation ABDC, -1.00% (""Alcentra"" or the ""Company""), a provider of customized debt and equity financing solutions primarily to lower middle-market companies based in the United States, today announced its financial results for the second quarter of 2017. Second Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Total investment income of $8.3 million Net investment income of $4.8 million, or $0.36 per share based on weighted average shares of common stock outstanding Invested $11.4 million in debt and equity securities, inclusive of three add-on investments and one refinancing Received proceeds from repayments of $14.5 million Equity issuance of 808,161 shares for net proceeds of $10.8 million Paid regular quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share on July 6, 2017 Net asset value of $181.3 million, or $12.73 per share, which is down from $13.43 in the first quarter of 2017; Weighted Average Portfolio Company Leverage – 3.68x, which is flat from last quarter Weighted Average Debt Portfolio Yield – 11.6% Management Commentary ""We are pleased to announce that during the 2 [nd] quarter Alcentra Capital led a $72 million refinancing for LRI Holding, Inc. (a.k.a. Integrated Efficiency Solutions), a DFW Capital Partners portfolio company, and made an incremental investment of $7.3 million in the refinancing. We also provided incremental capital to NTI Holdings, LLC for a follow-on acquisition.  Both companies are performing in line with expectations at this juncture. While the pace of pre-payments outpaced our redeployment of capital for this quarter with prospective Q2 investments being pushed into Q3, we have a number of new investments in the pipeline that we are pursuing that we look to close during Q3.  The number of write-ups also exceeded the number of write-downs, although we marked down a higher dollar amount of the portfolio. Total unrealized gains on the portfolio were $3.7 million which was offset by $13.7 million of unrealized losses for a net unrealized loss of $9.9 million.  The largest contributor to the unrealized loss was a $8.4 million write-down on our investment in My Alarm Center, LLC. On July 14, 2017, as part of a recapitalization and change of control transaction of My Alarm Center, LLC, we invested an additional $1.9 million into new securities pari-passu with the company's new owner, funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P., and converted our existing debt into various classes of equity securities. Our decision to invest an additional $1.9 million in My Alarm was made with a view that with a new owner and recapitalized balance sheet we may be able to not only realize an appropriate return, but recoup some portion of our original debt investment which has now been converted to equity. We also took additional write-downs of several other companies – largely in the automotive and for profit education sectors – as we work through various business and credit related matters with these borrowers. Lastly, we continue to maintain a disciplined underwriting process which can, at times, impact the velocity of our capital deployment. While economic conditions are steady and the capital markets continue to show strength, we recognize that we are in the mid-to-late innings of the current credit cycle and take these factors into consideration when selecting investments and sectors which to pursue."" Second Quarter 2017 Financial Results For the three months ended June 30, 2017, total investment income was $8.3 million, a decrease of $2.3 million over the $10.6 million of total investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower prepayment fee income in the second quarter of 2017 as opposed to the $1.8 million of prepayment fee income in the second quarter of 2016. There was also a shift in timing of the closing of new deals. Interest and PIK income comprised $7.7 million and other income was $0.6 million. Net investment income for the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $4.8 million ($0.36 per share which is based on average shares outstanding of 13.6 million) For the three months ended June 30, 2017, net expenses were $3.5 million. Interest and financing expenses for the quarter was $1.5 million and the base management fee (net of a $0.2 million waiver) was $1.1 million. There were no incentive fees earned for the three months ended June 30, 2017. Professional fees and other general and administrative expenses totaled $0.5 million for the three months ended June 30, 2017. During the three months ended June 30, 2017, we recorded a net realized gain on investments of $0.03 million.  During the quarter, we also recorded a net change in unrealized depreciation from portfolio investments of $9.9 million attributable to net unrealized depreciation on our debt investments, in particular from the write-down of our debt investment in My Alarm Center, LLC. As a result of these events, our net decrease in net assets resulting from operations during the three months ended June 30, 2017 was $5.2 million. Portfolio and Investment Activities As of June 30, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $271.4 million and consisted of 30 portfolio companies. The average portfolio investment on a cost basis was $10.0 million and equity constituted 8.8% of the portfolio.  During the second quarter, we invested $11.4 million in debt and equity investments, including three add-on investments and one refinancing, and received proceeds from repayments and amortizations on investments of $14.5 million. As of June 30, 2017, the weighted average yield on debt investments was 11.6%. Add-on investments during the quarter included the following: NTI Holdings, LLC - $3.5 million additional investments in 1 [st] lien notes and $0.1 million of equity Black Diamond Rentals - $0.3 million investment in tranche C super senior notes My Alarm Center, LLC - $0.3 million investment in second lien notes LRI Holding, Inc. – $7.2 million additional investments in 1 [st] lien notes and $0.1 million of equity As of June 30, 2017, Alcentra had two investments, Show Media, Inc. and My Alarm Center, LLC, on non-accrual status.

On July 7, 2017, Superior Controls, Inc. repaid an additional $175,000 of its 1 [st] lien debt. On July 11, 2017, Alcentra funded an additional $2.0 million in Lugano Diamonds & Jewelry, Inc. On July 14, 2017, Alcentra funded an additional $1.9 million in My Alarm Center, LLC as part of the recapitalization and change of control transaction described above in the Management Commentary. Third Quarter 2017 Regular Dividend of $0.34 Per Share Declared On August 3, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share for the third quarter of 2017, which is payable on October 5, 2017 to stockholders of record as of September 30, 2017. Alcentra has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (""DRIP"") that provides for reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, when the Company declares a cash dividend, stockholders who have not ""opted out"" of the DRIP at least three days prior to the dividend payment date will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company's common stock. Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.

First Quarter 2017 Financial Highlights Total investment income of $9.2 million Net investment income of $4.6 million, or $0.34 per share Invested $31.9 million in debt and equity securities, including investments in 2 new portfolio companies and five add-on investments Received proceeds from repayments of $22.2 million Paid regular quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share and special dividend of $0.03 per share on April 6, 2017 Net asset value (NAV) of $180.4 million, or $13.43 per share, which is down from $13.72 in the fourth quarter; Weighted Average Portfolio Leverage – 3.65x, which is down from the prior quarter of 3.93x Weighted Average Portfolio Yield – 11.7% Management Commentary ""As stated in our fourth quarter earnings announcement, we will be deploying capital prudently over the first six months of the 2017 fiscal year, as a series of pre-payments in the fourth quarter of 2016 left the portfolio at a lower level of AUM than planned. Based on our pipeline, we are on target to achieve the targeted level of AUM by the end of the second quarter of 2017; with steady portfolio growth expected thereafter."" We achieved our earnings goals for the quarter – net investment income - while maintaining portfolio yield and weighted average leverage within the portfolio. The number of portfolio companies written up during the quarter exceeded the number of portfolio companies written down by two-fold, with 10 of our 31 portfolio companies experiencing a write-up. Volatility was largely isolated to one portfolio company, where there is a plan in place to manage this issue. We are seeing strong performance in several of our portfolio companies – in semiconductor services, environmental and recycling services, and technology services - with the expectation that this dynamic will continue for the rest of the year."" First Quarter 2017 Financial Results For the three months ended March 31, 2017, total investment income was $9.2 million, a decrease of $0.7 million, or 7.5% over the $9.9 million of total investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2016. This decrease was primarily attributable to the shift in timing of the closing of new deals relative to repayments. Interest and PIK income comprised $7.3 million and other income was $0.6 million. For the three months ended March 31, 2017, total expenses were $4.6 million. Interest and financing expenses for the quarter was $1.9 million and the base management fee was $1.2 million. The income based incentive fee for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $0.6 million and there was no capital gains incentive fee accrual. Professional fees and other general and administrative expenses totaled $0.8 million for the three months ended March 31, 2017. Net investment income for the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $4.6 million ($0.34 per share). During the three months ended March 31, 2017, we recorded a net realized loss on investments of $1.0 million largely due to the secondary sale of Wholesome Sweeteners.  During the quarter, we recorded a net change in unrealized depreciation from portfolio investments of $1.8 million attributable to net unrealized depreciation on debt investments. As a result of these events, our net increase in net assets resulting from operations during the three months ended March 31, 2017 was $1.0 million. Per share results for the first quarter ended March 31, 2017 are based on average shares outstanding of 13.44 million. Portfolio and Investment Activities As of March 31, 2017, the fair value of our investment portfolio totaled $283.3 million and consisted of 31 portfolio companies. The average portfolio investment on a cost basis was $9.5 million and equity constituted 7.7% of the portfolio, down from 29% at the time of the IPO. During the first quarter, we invested $31.9 million in debt and equity investments, including two new portfolio companies and five add-on investments, and received proceeds from repayments and amortizations on investments of $22.2 million. As of March 31, 2017, the weighted average yield on debt investments was 11.7%, which is the same as the weighted average yield from the December 31, 2016 period. First quarter 2017 investment activity included the following new portfolio company investments: Pharmalogics Recruiting (""PLR"") is a provider of recruiting process outsourcing and staffing services for life science and pharma companies. Alcentra invested $10.0 million in Senior Notes on January 31, 2017. Champion ONE (""C1"") resells third party optical transceivers and related fiber optic network components primarily to telephone and CATV network operators in the U.S. Alcentra invested $7.5 million in Senior Notes and $1.125 million in equity on March 17, 2017. Add-on investments during the quarter included the following: Superior Controls - $5.85 million investment in 1 [st] lien notes LRI - $2.27 million investment in 1 [st] lien notes Pharmalogic - $2.12 million investment in subordinated notes Black Diamond - $466k investment in tranche C super senior notes My Alarm Center - $1.01 million investment in subordinated notes As of March 31, 2017, Alcentra has one investment on non-accrual – an out of home media and advertising company based in Las Vegas – which has been on our Watch List intermittently and represents less than 1.5% of our portfolio. We added My Alarm Center to our Watch List during the first quarter. Liquidity and Capital Resources At March 31, 2017, Alcentra had $4.7 million in cash and cash equivalents.  Alcentra had $46.9 million of borrowings outstanding on its $135 million senior secured revolving credit facility and $55.0 million outstanding of Alcentra Capital InterNotes. Subsequent Events On April 6, 2017, Alcentra paid a dividend to shareholders of record as of March 31, 2017 of $0.34 per share and a special dividend of $0.03 per share. On April 12, 2017, Alcentra funded an additional $0.144 million in Black Diamond. On April 28, 2017, Alcentra funded an additional $0.295 million to My Alarm Center. On May 4, 2017, the Board of Directors approved the 2017 second quarter dividend of $0.34 per share for shareholders of record date June 30, 2017 and payable July 6, 2017. Second Quarter 2017 Regular Dividend of $0.34 Per Share Declared On May 4, 2017, the Company's Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $0.34 per share for the Second Quarter of 2017 payable on July 6, 2017 to stockholders of record as of June 30, 2017. Alcentra has adopted a dividend reinvestment plan (""DRIP"") that provides for reinvestment of dividends on behalf of its stockholders, unless a stockholder elects to receive cash. As a result, when the Company declares a cash dividend, stockholders who have not ""opted out"" of the DRIP at least three days prior to the dividend payment date will have their cash dividends automatically reinvested in additional shares of the Company's common stock. Those stockholders whose shares are held by a broker or other financial intermediary may receive dividends in cash by notifying their broker or other financial intermediary of their election.
