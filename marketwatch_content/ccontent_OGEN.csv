OGEN,"(EDGAR Online via COMTEX) -- ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. The following information should be read in conjunction with the Financial Statements, including the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Form 10-K. This discussion contains certain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those discussed in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors, including, but not limited to, those set forth herein and elsewhere in this Form 10-K. Overview We are focused on becoming a leader in developing novel antibiotics against infectious disease and on developing effective treatments for oral mucositis. Our Oral Mucositis Product Candidate-Clinical In June of 2015, we entered into a worldwide Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement (""Oral Mucositis ECC"") with Intrexon Corporation (""Intrexon"") and Intrexon Actobiotics NV, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Intrexon, pursuant to which we obtained certain exclusive rights to AG013 as a potential treatment of oral mucositis, or OM for cancer patients, which we intend to continue to develop. AG013, is an oral rinsing solution designed to deliver human Trefoil Factor 1 (hTFF1) to protect and regenerate damaged mucosal lining of the oral cavity. OM results in a painful inflammation and mucosal ulceration in the lining of the oral cavity, throat and esophagus and is one of the most commonly reported adverse events associated with cancer chemotherapy. Approximately 770,000 patients annually in the US are at an increased risk of developing OM according to cancer statistics provided by the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in 2017. OM has a negative effect on patient well-being and if severe, negatively affects adherence to a patient's cancer treatment regimen. At present, we are not aware of any drug that is approved to prevent the condition broadly and current therapies are primarily palliative in nature, only addressing symptom relief but not treating the underlying causes of the condition. In a Phase 1b clinical trial in 25 cancer patients with OM, AG013 was safe and well tolerated. Data published in the journal Cancer showed a 35% reduction of the duration of ulcerative OM in the AG013-treated patients versus the placebo-treated patients. Furthermore, close to 30% of the patients treated with AG013 were full responders while all placebo-treated patients developed ulcerative OM. Additionally, in a Phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) study in 10 healthy volunteers, AG013 bacteria adhered to the buccal mucosa and actively secrete protein locally, resulting in homogeneous exposure of the entire mucosal surface up to 24 hours after administration of the rinse. During the first quarter of 2016, we conducted a confirmatory animal study on AG013. AG013 has been granted Orphan Drug status in the European Union. In November of 2016, the United States Food and Drug Administration (the ""FDA"") granted Fast Track designation for AG013, and we believe it may be eligible for Biologic License Application exclusivity as well. We have developed a Phase 2 protocol for AG013 with the FDA under the fast track designation. The study will be a double blind, placebo controlled, evaluation of daily AG013, administered three times a day, oral rinse for the duration of the cancer treatment. The study is expected to enroll between 160-180 evaluable patients receiving chemoradiation over 7 to 9 weeks. The primary endpoint is a reduction, compared to the placebo, in the number of days of severe oral mucositis. In addition, a number of secondary endpoints will also be evaluated. In August of 2016, we received feedback from the FDA in response to our Type C meeting and the pursuit of a Phase 2 trial on AG013 for the treatment of oral mucositis in head and neck cancer patients. We filed an Investigational New Drug (""IND"") update in March 2017 and we initiated the Phase 2 study with AG013 in the United States in 2017 with the expectation that we will expand the trial into Europe in 2018. We have announced that the first patient has been dosed in the Phase 2 clinical trial of AG013 for the treatment of OM. The Phase 2 clinical trial of AG013 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will be conducted at approximately 45 clinical sites across the United States and Europe, and is expected to enroll up to 200 patients. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability and pharmacokinetics of orally administered AG013 compared to placebo for reducing OM in patients undergoing chemo-radiation for the treatment of head and neck cancer, as measured by the duration, time to development, and overall incidence of OM. Presently, the Phase 2 clinical study is enrolling patients in the United States. Our Antibiotic Product Candidate-Preclinical Members of our scientific team discovered that a certain bacterial strain produces MU1140, a molecule belonging to the novel class of antibiotics known as lantibiotics. Lantibiotics, such as MU1140, are highly modified peptide antibiotics made by a small group of Gram positive bacterial species. Approximately 60 lantibiotics have been discovered. We believe lantibiotics are generally recognized by the scientific community to be potent antibiotic agents. Table of Contents In nonclinical testing, MU1140 has shown activity against all Gram positive bacteria against which it has been tested, including those responsible for a number of healthcare associated infections, or HAIs. A high percentage of hospital-acquired infections are caused by highly resistant bacteria such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. We believe the need for novel antibiotics is increasing as a result of the growing resistance of target pathogens to existing FDA approved antibiotics on the market. Lantibiotics have been difficult to investigate for their clinical usefulness as therapeutic agents in the treatment of infectious diseases due to a general inability to produce or synthesize sufficient quantities of pure amounts of these molecules. Traditional fermentation methods can only produce minute amounts of the lantibiotic. In June 2012, we entered into the Lantibiotic Exclusive Channel Collaboration agreement (""Lantibiotic ECC"") with Intrexon for the development and commercialization of the native strain of MU1140 and related homologs using Intrexon's advanced transgene and cell engineering platforms. Through our work with Intrexon, we have been able to produce a significant increase in the fermentation titer of MU1140 compared to standard fermentation methods and have discovered a new purification process for MU1140. Our work with Intrexon generated a substantial number of homologs of MU1140, and we are continuing our research and development and collaboration efforts with Intrexon to develop potential derivatives of the MU1140 molecule using genetically modified bacteria. In our pre-clinical studies to support a potential IND filing with the FDA, we tested a total of six homologs of MU1140 for certain compound characteristics, including but not limited to: drug activity (based on minimum inhibitory concentration or ""MIC"") equal or better than ""standard of care"" drugs against certain drug-resistant bacteria, safety, toxicity, stability, and manufacturability. An animal study specifically evaluated homolog efficacy in relation to survival, measurable amounts of Clostridium difficile (""C. diff"") colony forming units, and toxin levels. Three homologs demonstrated promising results with one homolog, OG253 achieving a 100% survival rate throughout the entire study in contrast to an approximately 30% survival rate for the vancomycin positive control. We selected a lead candidate, OG253, and we had a pre IND meeting with the FDA in November of 2015 regarding the pursuit of an IND for OG253. Following additional research and development on second generation lantibiotics, in August of 2016, we opted to select a second generation lantibiotic, OG716, for treatment of C. diff as our new lead candidate. OG716 is a new, orally-active homolog, that has exhibited positive results in an animal model for potential treatment of C. diff. Generated from our MU1140 platform, this new lantibiotic showed promising efficacy in reducing clinically relevant C. diff infections as measured by increased animal survival and decreased relapse as well as reduced production of toxins A & B and C. diff spores when compared to a vancomycin positive control. The timing of the filing of an IND regarding OG716 is subject to our having sufficient available capital given all of our anticipated needs and expected requirements in connection with our ongoing research and development initiatives. While we were able to raise additional capital during the year ended December 31, 2017, we currently expect the IND for a first-in-human clinical study of OG716 by year end 2018 as we continue to seek additional capital to advance the program. Other Product Candidates and Technologies. In addition to our lantibiotics and oral mucositis product candidates, we also have other candidates and technologies in the oral care and weight loss areas. We do not intend to continue to develop these potential product candidates and technologies without partnering with a third party. We out-licensed the continued research and development of our weight loss product candidate in December 2013 to, LPThera LLC, and LPThera LLC continues to work to develop a product for commercial use. Our oral care product candidate SMaRT Replacement Therapy is positioned for out-licensing opportunities. Recent Developments Completed Capital Raise. On November 8, 2017, the Company completed a private placement of $3.3 million of Series B Non-Voting, Convertible Preferred Stock (the ""Series B Preferred Stock""), including the issuance of warrants to acquire 1,064,518 shares of common stock, pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement with four existing shareholders who are accredited investors including, the Koski Family Limited Partnership, an entity affiliated with a director of the Company, (the ""Series B Preferred Stock Financing""). Completed Debt Conversion. On November 8, 2017, concurrently with the Series B Preferred Stock Financing, the Company also entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement (the ""Intrexon Debt Conversion Agreement"") with Intrexon Corporation (""Intrexon"") pursuant to which Intrexon exchanged the $2.4 million unsecured, non-convertible, promissory note previously issued by the Company to Intrexon (the ""Intrexon Note""), the accrued interest on the Intrexon Note and trade payables owed by the Company to Intrexon (collectively the ""Debt"") in the aggregate amount of approximately $3.4 million for equity in the form of shares of Series C, Non-Voting, Non-Convertible Preferred Stock (the ""Series C Preferred Stock"") issued by the Company to Intrexon. Each issued and outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock entitles the holder of record to receive dividends at the annual rate of twelve percent Table of Contents (12%) (the ""Initial Rate"") of its Stated Value, payable by issuing additional shares of Series C Preferred Stock within thirty days after the end of each calendar year and pro-rata for partial years. On January 25, 2018 we paid a dividend on our Series C Preferred Stock to Intrexon of 1.733 shares for the portion of the 2017 the Series C Preferred was outstanding. The Initial Rate shall be subject to increase to twenty percent (20%) automatically, after May 10, 2019, if the Series C Preferred Stock is not earlier redeemed by us. Amended our Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreements with Intrexon. In connection with the Series B Preferred Stock Financing and the Intrexon Debt Conversion Agreement, on November 8, 2017, we amended (i) our Lantibiotic ECC and the Lantibiotic Stock Issuance Agreement (together the ""Lantibiotic Program"") and (ii) our Oral Mucositis ECC and Oral Mucositis Stock Issuance Agreement (together the ""Oral Mucositis Program""). The Lantibiotic Program was revised as follows: Consolidated all historical, and yet to be achieved, research and development milestones into a single milestone payment of $25 million to Intrexon, payable within 6 months of first regulatory approval of a NDA or a BLA and provided for a payment of $5.0 million to Intrexon within 6 months of regulatory approval of any subsequent supplemental NDA resulting in an expanded new indication or NDA of a subsequent lantibiotic from the lantibiotic library; Reduced the royalty rate from 25% of Product Profit to 10% of Net Sales; Reduced the sublicense revenue percentage from 50% to 25%; Revised the form of milestone payments from being share based or cash at our election to only cash; and Committed that Diligent Efforts (as defined in the Lantibiotic ECC) in pursuing the Lantibiotic Program would be deemed satisfied in 2018 provided that at least $1,200,000 was expended for the advancement of the Lantibiotic Program. The Oral Mucositis Program was revised as follows: Consolidated all historical, and yet to be achieved, research and development milestones into a single milestone payment to Intrexon of $27.5 million payable within 6 months of first regulatory approval of a NDA or BLA and provided for a payment of $5.0 million to Intrexon within 6 months of regulatory approval of any subsequent supplemental NDA resulting in an expanded new indication or NDA of a subsequent AG013 product; Reduced sublicense revenue percentage from 50% to 25%. Revised the definition of ""Field"" in the Oral Mucositis ECC to reflect and clarify that Oragenics has the worldwide exclusive rights to the treatment of Oral Mucositis regardless of its cause. Received NYSE Notification of Regained Listing Compliance. Following consummation of the Series B Preferred Stock Financing and Debt Conversion, on November 10, 2017, we received notification from NYSE American that the Company is back in compliance with all of the NYSE American continued listing standards. Amended our Articles of Incorporation. On December 29, 2017, we amended our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of our common stock from 250,000,000 shares to 450,000,000 (unadjusted for reverse stock split referenced below). The purpose of the increase in the number of authorized shares of our common stock is to provide flexibility in connection with our future financing efforts. Consummated a Reverse Stock Split. On January 19, 2018 we effected a one for ten reverse stock split of our authorized and outstanding common stock, by filing Articles of Amendment to our Articles of Incorporation. As a result of the reverse stock split (i) proportionate adjustments have been made to the per share exercise price and/or the number of shares issuable upon the exercise or vesting of all stock options and warrants issued by us and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time, which resulted in a proportionate decrease in the number of shares of our common stock reserved for issuance upon exercise or vesting of such stock options and warrants, and, in the case of stock options and warrants, a proportionate increase in the exercise price of all such stock options and warrants; (ii) proportionate adjustments have been made to the conversion price applicable to outstanding shares of Series A and Series B Convertible Preferred Stock; (iii) the number of shares authorized for future grant under our equity incentive/compensation plans immediately prior to the effective time have been reduced proportionately; and (iv) the number of authorized shares of common stock as recently increased have been reduced from 450,000,000 shares to 45,000,000 shares. About Us We were incorporated in November 1996 and commenced operations in 1999. We consummated our initial public offering in June 2003. We have devoted substantially all of our available resources to our discovery efforts comprising research and development, clinical trials for our product candidates, protection of our intellectual property and the general and administrative support of these operations as well as to the commercialization of our consumer ProBiora3 products. We have generated limited revenues from grants Table of Contents and from our recently disposed of consumer ProBiora3 product business through June 30, 2016, and have principally funded our operations through the sale of debt and equity securities, including the exercise of warrants issued in connection with these financing transactions. Prior to 2008, our revenues were derived solely from research grants. Since 2008, our revenues have also included sales from our recently disposed of consumer probiotics business, which we initiated in late 2008. Our net revenues were $-0- and $464,048, for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In June of 2016, we completed the sale of our consumer probiotics business to ProBiora Health, LLC and as a result, we will no longer generate revenue from sales of consumer probiotic products. As of December 31, 2017 we had an accumulated deficit of $101,400,797 and we have yet to achieve profitability. We incurred net losses of $6,731,525 and $7,013,304 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we seek to advance our product candidates through nonclinical testing and clinical trials to ultimately obtain regulatory approval and eventual commercialization. We need to raise additional capital. The report of our independent registered public accounting firm with respect to our financial statements appearing in our Form 10-K contains an explanatory paragraph stating that our operating losses and negative cash flows from operations, and our need to raise additional financing and/or financial support prior to July 2018 in order to continue to fund our operations, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. There can be no assurance that additional capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all. Adequate additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. We expect that research and development expenses will increase along with general and administrative costs, as we grow and operate our business. Financial Overview Net Revenues Our revenues were historically derived from sales of our ProBiora3 products and were $-0- and $464,048 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. In June of 2016, we completed the sale of our consumer probiotics business to ProBiora Health, LLC and as a result our historic consumer probiotic revenues are not included in net revenue but rather are reflected as part of ""Discontinued Operations"" for the periods presented. Research and Development Expenses Research and development consists of expenses incurred in connection with the discovery and development of our product candidates. These expenses consist primarily of employee-related expenses, which include salaries and benefits and attending science conferences; expenses incurred under our ECC agreements with Intrexon and under other agreements with contract research organizations, investigative sites and consultants that conduct our clinical trials and a substantial portion of our nonclinical studies; the cost of acquiring and manufacturing clinical trial materials; facilities, depreciation and other allocated expenses, which include direct and allocated expenses for rent and maintenance of facilities and equipment, and depreciation of fixed assets; license fees, for and milestone payments related to, in-licensed products and technology; stock-based compensation expense; and costs associated with nonclinical activities and regulatory approvals. We expense research and development costs as incurred. Our research and development expenses can be divided into (i) clinical research, and (ii) nonclinical research and development activities. Clinical research costs consist of clinical trials, manufacturing services, regulatory activities and related personnel costs, and other costs such as rent, utilities, depreciation and stock-based compensation. Nonclinical research and development costs consist of our research activities, nonclinical studies, related personnel costs and laboratory supplies, and other costs such as rent, utilities, depreciation and stock-based compensation and research expenses we incur associated with our ECC agreements with Intrexon. While we are currently focused on advancing our product development programs, our future research and development expenses will depend on the clinical success of our product candidates, as well as ongoing assessments of each product candidate's commercial potential. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates may be subject to future collaborations, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans, research expenses and capital requirements. Our research and development expenses were $3,539,656 and $4,754,650 for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively. Our current strategy is to increase our research and development expenses in the future as we continue the advancement of our clinical trials and nonclinical product development programs for our lantibiotic product candidate and with respect to our oral mucositis product candidate. The lengthy process of completing clinical trials; seeking regulatory approval for our product candidates; and expanding the claims we are able to make, requires expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials, or in obtaining regulatory approvals, could cause a delay in generating product revenues and cause our research and development expenses to increase and, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our operations. Our current product candidates are not expected to be commercially available until we are able to obtain regulatory approval from the FDA. Table of Contents Our plan is to budget and manage expenditures in research and development such that they are undertaken in a cost-effective manner yet still advance the research and development efforts. While we have some control under our Lantibiotic ECC and Oral Mucositis ECC as to the planning and timing of the research and development and therefore the timing of when expenditures may be incurred for various phases of agreed upon projects, actual expenditures can vary from period to period. Subject to available capital, we expect overall research and development expenses to fluctuate as our financial resources permit. Our research and development projects are currently expected to be taken to the point where they can be licensed or partnered with larger pharmaceutical companies. General and Administrative Expenses General and administrative expenses consist principally of salaries and related costs for personnel in executive, finance, business development, marketing, information technology, legal and human resources functions. Other general and administrative expenses include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses, patent filing, and professional fees for legal, consulting, auditing and tax services. We anticipate that our general and administrative expenses may continue to increase for, among others, the following reasons: to support our research and development activities, which, subject to available capital, we expect to expand as we continue the development of our product candidates; the efforts we undertake from, time to time, to raise additional capital; and the increased payroll, and stock based compensation, expanded infrastructure and higher consulting, legal, accounting and investor relations costs associated with being a public company. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) includes local business taxes, as well as interest income and expense. Interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents, and interest on the stock subscription receivable. The primary objective of our investment policy is capital preservation. Interest expense consists primarily of interest and costs associated with our indebtedness. Income Taxes As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $93,966,000 and $87,663,000, respectively, to offset future federal and state income taxes. We also have research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately $2,016,000and $1,875,000 as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, to offset future federal and state income taxes. Our net operating loss and research and development tax credit carryforwards will expire if not used by 2037 and 2027, respectively. Our ability to utilize our net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited in the event a change in ownership, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, has occurred or may occur in the future. Our private placement transaction with the KFLP in June 2009 constituted such an event and our historical loss carryforwards up to such point in time were limited. Furthermore, our transactions with Intrexon during 2013 constituted a second such event, and our historical loss carryforwards up to December 2013 were further limited. See ""Tax Loss Carryforwards."" In each period since our inception, we have recorded a 100% valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax asset, as the realization of the deferred tax asset is uncertain. As a result, we have not recorded any federal tax benefit in our statements of operations. On December 22, 2017, the Jobs Act was enacted, which reforms corporate tax legislation in the United States and related laws. One of the provisions of the new tax law reduces the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. The Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally 21%. However, the Company is still analyzing certain aspects of the Jobs Act and refining its calculations, which could potentially affect the measurement of this balance or potentially result in new deferred tax amounts. Any change in the Company's reasonable estimates of the impact of the Jobs Act will be included in the reporting period in which the change is identified in accordance with SAB Topic 5 EE. The provisional amount recorded related to the remeasurement of our deferred tax balance was $10,055,163. Critical Accounting Estimates and Policies Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""US GAAP""). The preparation of financial statements in accordance with US GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures. There are certain critical estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our financial statements. We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if: It requires us to make an assumption because information was not available at the time or it included matters that were highly uncertain at the time we were making the estimate; and Changes in the estimate or different estimates that we could have selected may have had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. The principal areas of estimation reflected in the financial statements are . . . Feb 16, 2018 (c) 1995-2018 Cybernet Data Systems, Inc.

OGEN,"Oragenics, Inc. (nyse american:OGEN), a leader in the development of new antibiotics against infectious diseases and effective treatments for oral mucositis, today announced that it has completed enrollment of the interim analysis cohort of 20 patients in its Phase 2 clinical trial of AG013 for the treatment of oral mucositis (OM). “We are very excited to complete this enrollment milestone for our Phase 2 trial of AG013 for oral mucositis, one of the most common and debilitating complications of chemo-radiation therapies. With no approved convenient preventative treatment, oral mucositis represents a serious unmet need for cancer patients receiving treatment on an outpatient basis,” said Alan Joslyn, Oragenics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “After we complete this treatment phase and evaluate the safety of the initial 20 patients enrolled in the trial, we intend on expanding the trial in the United States and Europe to complete study enrollment. We expect to report preliminary data on the initial 20 enrolled patients during the second quarter of 2018 with top-line results of the trial expected in 2019.” The purpose of the Phase II study (NCT03234465) is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of topically administered AG013 compared to placebo for reducing Oral Mucositis (OM) in patients undergoing chemoradiation for the treatment of head and neck cancer, as measured by the duration, time to development, and overall incidence of OM (WHO scale used) during the active treatment phase, beginning from the start of chemoradiation therapy (CRT) until 2 weeks following its completion. The Phase II trial is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm, multi-center trial in which subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either placebo or AG013. AG013 is a mouth rinse formulation of Lactococcus lactis strain sAGX0085, deficient in the gene coding for thymidylate synthase and producing human TFF1 (Trefoil Factor 1). Approximately 200 subjects will be enrolled in the study. An initial cohort of 10 patients that received AG013 is included in the 20 patients enrolled to date. Safety will be evaluated on the basis of treatment-emergent AEs (TEAEs), vital signs, weight, physical examinations, clinical laboratory assessments and the presence of AG013-sAGX0085 in whole blood. Tolerability (taste, consistency and smell) will be collected from the patient diary. In a Phase 1B study the efficacy analysis suggested a 35% reduction in percentage of days with UOM in AG013-subjects versus placebo. All placebo subjects experienced 2 days of UOM, whereas 29% of AG013 subjects had UOM for 0 or 1 day. AG013 use resulted in fewer unscheduled office and emergency room visits. No differences were noted in mouth and throat soreness, opioid use, or gastrostomy tube placement. In terms of safety and dosing, Oral live AG013 bacterial and hTFF1 levels in saliva and oral mucosa were equivalent among treatment groups. The most frequently occurring adverse events were nausea, oral pain, fatigue, diarrhea, and mucosal inflammation. Only 12% (3 of 25 adverse events), mainly nausea, were attributed to the investigational medicinal product: AG013 or placebo. Importantly, AG013 bacteria were not detected in blood. AG013 is an ActoBiotics [®] therapeutic candidate formulated as a convenient oral rinsing solution and designed by our strategic collaboration partner ActoBio Therapeutics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intrexon Corporation XON, -1.57% to deliver the therapeutic molecule Trefoil Factor 1 to the mucosal tissues in the oral cavity. Trefoil Factors are a class of peptides involved in the protection of gastrointestinal tissues against mucosal damage and play an important role in subsequent repair. AG013 received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2016. Under an Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement with ActoBio Therapeutics, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Intrexon Corporation , Oragenics has an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize AG013 to treat OM in cancer patients. About Oragenics, Inc. We are focused on becoming the world leader in novel antibiotics against infectious disease and on developing effective treatments for oral mucositis. Oragenics, Inc. has established two exclusive worldwide channel collaborations with Intrexon Corporation, a synthetic biology company.

OGEN,"Oragenics, Inc. (nyse american:OGEN) (the “Company”), a clinical stage biotechnology company, today announced the publication of a research paper entitled “Mutacin 1140 Lantibiotic Variants Are Efficacious Against Clostridium difficile Infection” in the peer reviewed journal, Frontiers in Microbiology, the largest microbiology journal in the world. Our researchers sought to identify a lead candidate for the treatment of Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) infections based on the lantibiotic Mutacin 1140 (MU1140). This antibiotic is produced by the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus mutans and has a novel and unique mechanism of action that may limit the development of drug resistance. Initial compounds were selected from a library of 418 variants of MU1140; researchers selected 6 potential compounds to test in animal models. Results from these in vivo models demonstrated that treatment with the compound OG253 led to 100% survival after 21 days, with no signs of relapse and supported its potential use as a new class of C. difficile antibiotic. “This study was the first of its kind to compare a large collection of MU1140 variants to identify potential candidates for the treatment of C. difficile infections,” commented Dr. Alan Joslyn, Chief Executive Officer and President of Oragenics. “Building on this study, we have since identified an improved compound, OG716, using our lantibiotic platform, as our lead candidate for C. difficile. OG716 has a comparable microbiology profile to previous compounds and does not require special formulation, effectively simplifying the production process and clinical administration compared to OG253. We are currently completing the toxicology and microbiology work for OG716 and anticipate filing an Investigational New Drug application in the near future. Lantibiotics have shown effective against antibiotic-resistant strains of various species, and Oragenics’ lantibiotic platform contains more than 700 unique structures, potentially generating a pipeline of new compounds.” Clostridium difficile is an infection causing colitis by producing toxins that damage the lining of the colon. It is considered an urgent threat by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with an incidence rate of 500,000 infections per year and a mortality rate of 29,000 deaths per year C. difficile infections, which are one of the most frequent hospital-acquired infections, have more recently affected people traditionally not considered high risk, triggering an increased health risk amongst the broader population.

OGEN,"GIG HARBOR, Wash., Jan. 29, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- LKA Gold Incorporated (otcqb:LKAI) reports that certain members of the Koski family informed the Company of open market purchases of LKA shares. Over the previous 90 days, 85,700 shares were purchased in market transactions at various prices between $0.18 - $0.25 per share. Regarding the purchase of additional LKA shares, Mr. Robert C. Koski commented, ""Kinross's withdrawal from the Exploration and Option Agreement presents a unique opportunity for LKA. Kinross performed very useful and expensive services in its geological evaluation and first round of drilling at the Company's Golden Wonder mine. This work is now the property of LKA at no cost to the Company. This presents LKA with the opportunity to complete the Golden Wonder drilling program at its own expense, without the requirement to share any discoveries. LKA is back in the position of 100% control, and benefit, of any discoveries, instead of only a 35% interest it was previously entitled to under the Kinross-LKA agreement.""  About the Koski Family The Koski Family Limited Partnership (""KFLP"") was organized in 1996 by members of the Robert E. Koski family as a vehicle for managing family assets and making strategic investments in a variety of industries. KFLP owns substantial equity interests in Sun Hydraulics Corporation SNHY, -4.00% Oragenics, Inc. OGEN, -5.17% nMetric, LLC, and other private companies. KFLP and members of the Koski family individually are LKA's largest shareholders. Recent purchases of LKA shares bring Koski family ownership to 8,785,700 shares which represents approximately 46% of LKA's total issued and outstanding shares of 19,261,717. (This ownership position does not include the purchase of $400,000 in LKA 7.5% Convertible Debentures which are convertible to LKA common stock at $0.50 per share). About LKA's exploration program at its Golden Wonder MineAs previously announced, the recently terminated Kinross drilling program, in LKA's opinion, only superficially and inconclusively tested four of the six original drill targets identified by Kinross geologists during a geochemistry evaluation of the surface area adjacent to, and well beyond, the original Golden Wonder discovery. (See maps of permitted drill sites at: http://lkagold.com/golden-wonder-mine). All six of the original drill targets possess surface geochemistry similar to the original high-grade ore shoot that, during LKA's ownership, yielded over 141,000 ounces from an area measuring less than 10,000 square feet. Ore grades from commercial production (2000-2006) were 16.01 oz gold per ton. Upon resuming exploratory mining operations in the first quarter of 2009, LKA shipped twenty-nine bulk ore samples containing more than 4,900 ounces of gold with a net value, after processing, of over $5.1 million. Ore sales covered a substantial portion of LKA's exploration expenses to date. Investors are cautioned that LKA continues to generate substantial losses and additional funding and exploration work is required. A commercially viable ore reserve has yet to be established and there can be no assurance of success. Safe Harbor Statement Any views or opinions expressed in this press release are exclusively those of LKA management and do not represent Kinross' assessments or conclusions. LKA's plans to resume Golden Wonder production are subject to a number of conditions including, but not limited to, favorable geology, successful exploration efforts, favorable financing terms/availability, permits, government regulation, gold prices, market conditions, etc. Investment in LKA must be considered highly speculative. Mining and related activities are inherently high-risk endeavors and there can be no assurance that LKA will be successful. Forward-looking statements in this release are made pursuant to the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 and the Bespeaks Caution Doctrine. Investors are cautioned that the Company continues to generate substantial losses and additional funding and exploration work is required. A commercially viable ore reserve has yet to be established.

OGEN,"TAMPA,Fla., Nov 09, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Oragenics, Inc. (nyse mkt:OGEN), a clinical stage biotechnology company, today announced that it has completed a private placement of $3.3 million of Non-Voting Series B Convertible Preferred Stock (the “Series B Preferred Stock”) with four existing shareholders who are accredited investors including an entity affiliated with a director of the Company (the “Preferred Stock Financing”). Concurrently with the Preferred Stock Financing, the Company also entered into a Debt Conversion Agreement (the “Debt Conversion Agreement”) with Intrexon Corporation (“Intrexon”), pursuant to which Intrexon exchanged its $2.4 million unsecured non-convertible promissory note previously issued by the Company to Intrexon (the “Intrexon Note”), the accrued interest on the Intrexon Note and trade payables owed to Intrexon, including accrued interest in the aggregate amount of approximately $3.4 million (collectively the “Debt”) for equity in the form of 100 shares of Series C Non-Voting, Non-Convertible, Preferred Stock (the “Series C Preferred Stock”) issued by the Company to Intrexon. Additionally, the Company amended its two Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreements and related Stock Issuance Agreements, with Intrexon for its Oral Mucositis and Lantibiotic programs (collectively the “ECC Amendments”) to consolidate the development milestone payments into one payment within six months after the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) approval for each separate program. Dr. Alan Joslyn, the Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer stated, “We are extremely pleased with the financial commitment that our investors and Intrexon have shown to the Company’s programs through this financing, Debt Conversion and ECC Amendments. The proceeds from the stock offering will enable us to continue advancing our promising biotherapeutic candidates.” The Preferred Stock Private Placement The Company issued an aggregate of 6,600,000 shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a purchase price of $0.50 per share which are convertible into 13,200,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock, based on a conversion ratio of one share of Series B Preferred Stock into two shares of common stock. The purchase price per share represented by the shares of common stock the Series B Preferred Stock is convertible into equates to $0.25 per share. In addition, the Company issued to the investors in the private placement accompanying warrants to purchase an aggregate of 10,645,161 shares of Common Stock.The Warrants have a term of seven years from the date of issuance, are non-exercisable until 6 months after issuance, and have an exercise price of $0.31 per share.

Proceeds from the Preferred Stock Financing (including the exercise of any warrants for cash) will be used for the advancement of the AG013 Oral Mucositis clinical trial and the lantibiotic program and general corporate purposes, including working capital. The Company believes that the proceeds from the Preferred Stock Financing as well as the exchange of the Debt for Series C Preferred Stock will also allow the Company to timely comply with its plan to regain compliance with the NYSE MKT’s shareholders’ equity requirements. The ECC Amendments The ECC Amendment for the Company’s oral mucositis product candidate ActoBiotics [®] AG013, an oral biotherapeutic, provides for a single milestone payment within six months after FDA approval of $27,500,000 and revised the field in which the Company has exclusive rights to its oral mucositis product candidate for the treatment of oral mucositis to clarify the Company has an exclusive for the treatment of Oral Mucositis in humans regardless of etiology. The ECC Amendment for the Company’s lantibiotic product candidate provided for a single milestone payment within six months after FDA approval of $25,000,000. Each ECC was modified to reduce the sublicense revenue percentage it would have to pay from 50% to 25%. The Lantibiotic ECC royalty rate was also revised from 25% of Positive Product Profit to 10% of Net Sales. The Intrexon Debt Conversion Intrexon exchanged the Debt for equity in the form of 100 shares of Series C Preferred Stock issued by the Company to Intrexon. The Series C Preferred Stock is non-voting and non-convertible and is redeemable in whole or part at any time by the Company for cash. The Series C Preferred bears an accruing annual PIK dividend payable in Series C Preferred Stock of 12% through May 10, 2019 and after such date, the dividend will accrue at 20%, annually, unless earlier redeemed by the Company. The Series B Preferred Stock, Warrants and Series C Preferred Stock were offered and sold in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Regulation D promulgated thereunder.

OGEN,"TAMPA, Fla., Aug 31, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Oragenics, Inc. (nyse mkt:OGEN), a leader in the development of new antibiotics against infectious diseases and effective treatments for oral mucositis, today announced that the first patient has been dosed in its Phase 2 clinical trial of AG013 for the treatment of oral mucositis (OM). “We are very excited to dose the first patient and initiate the Phase 2 trial of AG013 for oral mucositis, one of the most common and debilitating complications of chemo-radiation therapies. With no approved preventative treatment, oral mucositis represents a serious unmet need that we hope to help overcome,” said Alan Joslyn, Oragenics’ President and Chief Executive Officer. “The initiation of the trial represents a significant milestone for Oragenics. We expect to report preliminary data on the initial 20 enrolled patients by the end of 2017 with completion and full results of the trial expected by the end of 2018.” The Phase 2 clinical trial of AG013 is a double-blind, placebo-controlled study that will be conducted at approximately 30 sites across the United States and Europe, and is expected to enroll up to 200 patients. The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of administered AG013 compared to placebo for reducing OM in patients undergoing chemo-radiation for the treatment of head and neck cancer, as measured by the duration, time to development, and overall incidence of OM. AG013 is an ActoBiotics [®] therapeutic candidate formulated as a convenient oral rinsing solution and designed by our strategic collaboration partner Intrexon Corporation XON, -1.57% to deliver the therapeutic molecule Trefoil Factor 1 to the mucosal tissues in the oral cavity. Trefoil Factors are a class of peptides involved in the protection of gastrointestinal tissues against mucosal damage and play an important role in subsequent repair. AG013 received Fast Track designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in November 2016. Under an Exclusive Channel Collaboration Agreement with Intrexon, Oragenics has an exclusive worldwide license to develop and commercialize AG013 to treat OM in cancer patients. About Oragenics, Inc.

OGEN,"TAMPA, Fla., Apr 18, 2017 (BUSINESS WIRE) -- Oragenics, Inc. (nysemkt:OGEN.BC), a clinical stage biotechnology company, today announced an update on the Company’s first quarter 2017 progress regarding its two product candidates, AG013 for the treatment of oral mucositis and OG716 for the treatment of Clostridium difficile (“C. diff”). With respect to our lead clinical candidate, AG013, Oragenics has submitted an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) amendment for the upcoming Phase II trial. We provided the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) with the updated protocol for the AG013 Phase II trial, including the identification of the trial sites in the United States and the manufacturing details of the product material. AG013 is an ActoBiotics™ therapeutic candidate formulated as a convenient oral rinsing solution and designed by our strategic collaboration partner Intrexon Corporation (“Intrexon”) to deliver the therapeutic molecule Trefoil Factor 1 to the mucosal tissues in the oral cavity. Trefoil Factors are a class of peptides involved in the protection of gastrointestinal tissues against mucosal damage and play an important role in subsequent repair. AG013 received FDA Fast Track designation in November 2016, which we believe further validates our science as well as highlights the serious need for a treatment for oral mucositis. Our partner Intrexon has provided a commitment letter for an unsecured $2.4 million loan to further the clinical development of AG013 that will mature in 24 months, bear interest at 12% per annum, and is conditional on Oragenics raising an additional $2.7 million in gross proceeds. Upon securing this additional financing, the Company will be positioned to initiate its Phase II trial for AG013 for the treatment of oral mucositis and promptly commence patient enrollment. Alan Joslyn, Oragenics’ Chief Executive Officer, commented, “We are pleased that our partner Intrexon continues to recognize the tremendous potential value in our AG013 product candidate through its continued support of the Company. We look forward to advancing our product portfolio to and through the clinic helping lead Oragenics to success.” Oragenics’ second clinical candidate is the lantibiotic OG716 for the treatment of C. diff developed through an Exclusive Channel Collaboration with Intrexon. C. diff is a bacterial infection that most commonly affects older adults in hospital and long-term care facilities after they receive an antibiotic administration, although there is an increasing rate of infection in younger, healthier populations. C. diff is now associated with nearly 500,000 infections annually in the United States, resulting in 29,000 deaths. We recently completed a successful pre-IND meeting for OG716 with the FDA. The agency confirmed that the clinical development plan based on the data obtained from preclinical studies, toxicity studies and manufacturing are appropriate to support the IND filing, thus paving a clear pathway to bring the first lantibiotic to treat this severe unmet medical need into the clinic.
