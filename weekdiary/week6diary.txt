It takes a long time to crawl the data. I keep the laptop running day and night. I tried to improve the efficience but just works a little. Finally we decided to arrange the priority for all codes. We will show several famous companies at demo, then complete all in following days. I also talked with Yisong about the database. The downloaded part seems work well.
