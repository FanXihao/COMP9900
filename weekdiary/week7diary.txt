This week we proceed our demo. The customer seemed be satisfied with our work. Thanks to my group mates for their huge contribution to our project. I improved the crawler again so it now can catch the relative companies of one piece of news by a more efficient method. And now the crawler can save the previous work in case exception happend or stop by operator. It really save the time. Next I'll try to analyze the stock to provide users with some helpful indicators.
